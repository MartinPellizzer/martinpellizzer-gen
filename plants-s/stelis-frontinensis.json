    "intro": "Stelis frontinensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few to several leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are often clustered and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Stelis frontinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
