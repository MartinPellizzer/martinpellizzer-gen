    "intro": "Scilla odorata f. versicolor, commonly known as the variable squill, is a botanical variant of the common squill. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to white and pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period and the variability in flower color."
