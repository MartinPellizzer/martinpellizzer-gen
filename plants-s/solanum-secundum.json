    "intro": "Solanum secundum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, yellow, berry-like fruits. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
