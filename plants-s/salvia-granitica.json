    "intro": "Salvia granitica, commonly known as granitic sage, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia granitica is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
