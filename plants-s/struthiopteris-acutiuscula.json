    "intro": "Struthiopteris acutiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
