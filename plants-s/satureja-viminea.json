    "intro": "Satureja viminea, commonly known as creeping savory, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary applications due to their pungent, slightly minty flavor. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its creeping growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in rock gardens or dry landscapes. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and opposite leaves."
