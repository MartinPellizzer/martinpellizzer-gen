    "intro": "Sedum obtrullatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, usually blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and easy-to-care-for ornamental plant."
