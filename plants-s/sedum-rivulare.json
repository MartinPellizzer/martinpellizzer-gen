    "intro": "Sedum rivulare, commonly known as the river sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to moist environments, often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and rocky areas. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and arranged in a tight rosette pattern. Sedum rivulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, water-retentive soils."
