    "intro": "Schizoglossum hilliardiae, commonly known as the Hilliard's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of central Australia, where it thrives in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its pale blue to violet flowers, which are tubular and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Schizoglossum hilliardiae is a perennial herb that produces its flowers during the cooler months, making it a unique addition to the flora of its native habitat."
