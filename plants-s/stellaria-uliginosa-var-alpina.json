    "intro": "Stellaria uliginosa var. alpina, commonly known as alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, branching stems covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine plant communities."
