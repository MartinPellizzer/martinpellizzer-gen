    "intro": "Selago diffusa, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has thin, wiry stems that spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, blooming in early summer. Selago diffusa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
