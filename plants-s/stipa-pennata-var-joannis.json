It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens for its delicate, upright growth habit and ability to withstand drought conditions."
