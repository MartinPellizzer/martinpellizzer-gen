    "intro": "Silene regis-ferdinandi, commonly known as the royal Ferdinand's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
