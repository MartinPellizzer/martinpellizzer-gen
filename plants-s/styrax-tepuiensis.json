    "intro": "Styrax tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui styrax, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Styracaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the tepuis. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
