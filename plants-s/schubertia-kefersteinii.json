It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Schubertia kefersteinii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
