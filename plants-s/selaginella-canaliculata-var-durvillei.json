    "intro": "Selaginella canaliculata var. durvillei, commonly known as the Durville's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss native to South Africa. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that forms dense mats on rocky outcrops and forest floors. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its stems. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
