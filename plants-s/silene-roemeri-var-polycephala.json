It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is a perennial species that produces numerous small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
