    "intro": "Saxifraga tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga tridentata is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
