    "intro": "Selaginella depressa, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Selaginella depressa has a unique reproductive system, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a trait known as heterosporous reproduction. Its ability to survive in diverse soil conditions makes it an important component of many forest ecosystems."
