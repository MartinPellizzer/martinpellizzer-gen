    "intro": "Serapias lingua lusus abnormis, commonly known as the abnormal tongue orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that resembles a tongue, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive red-and-yellow pattern. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
