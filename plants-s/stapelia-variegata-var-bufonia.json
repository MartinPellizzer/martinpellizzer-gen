    "intro": "Stapelia variegata var. bufonia, commonly known as the variegated stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The leaves are typically small and rounded, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are striking, with a yellowish-green color and a distinctive, odorless scent that mimics decay to attract pollinators. This plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
