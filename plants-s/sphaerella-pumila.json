    "intro": "Sphaerella pumila, commonly known as the little sphere lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on bark and soil. It has a pale green to yellowish-green thallus with a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic association with algae for photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Sphaerella pumila is a slow-growing species that plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
