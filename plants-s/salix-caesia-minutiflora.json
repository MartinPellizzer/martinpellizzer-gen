    "intro": "Salix caesia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. Salix caesia minutiflora is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
