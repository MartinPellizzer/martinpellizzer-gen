    "intro": "Stelis paniculata, commonly known as the orchid spider plant, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-draining soil. Its aerial roots allow it to attach to trees or other structures, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or mounted displays. Stelis paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
