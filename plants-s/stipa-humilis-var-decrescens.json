    "intro": "Stipa humilis var. decrescens, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils, often in steppe or desert environments. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of florets. This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
