    "intro": "Siphocampylus megalanthus, commonly known as the giant bellflower, is a striking perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a distinctive purple throat. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Siphocampylus megalanthus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
