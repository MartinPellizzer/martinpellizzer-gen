    "intro": "Sassafras albidum, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange or red berries in the fall. Its roots and bark contain compounds like safrole, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. However, due to the potential toxicity of safrole, its use in food products has been restricted in many countries."
