    "intro": "Streptomanes nymanii, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water through its haustoria, which connect to the host tree's vascular system. It plays a significant role in the ecosystem by supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity. However, it can also weaken its host and is considered a potential threat to native tree species."
