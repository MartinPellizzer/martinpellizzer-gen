    "intro": "Setaria viridis subsp. italica, commonly known as Italian foxtail, is a grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is often cultivated as a forage crop and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
