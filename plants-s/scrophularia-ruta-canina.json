    "intro": "Scrophularia ruta-canina, commonly known as common dog's mercury, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in whorls along the stems. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, which can make it invasive in certain habitats. Scrophularia ruta-canina is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
