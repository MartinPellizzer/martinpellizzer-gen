    "intro": "Scolymocephalus macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant head scolymus, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its large, bulbous head-like structure. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is native to specific alpine regions in Europe. The plant's most distinctive feature is its massive, rounded inflorescence that resembles a head, composed of numerous small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited soil nutrients. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance."
