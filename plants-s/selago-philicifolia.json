    "intro": "Selago philicifolia, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate stems and dense clusters of small, silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
