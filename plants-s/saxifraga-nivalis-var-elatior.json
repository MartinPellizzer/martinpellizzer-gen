    "intro": "Saxifraga nivalis var. elatior, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in July and August. Its leaves are generally elliptical or ovate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga nivalis var. elatior is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil."
