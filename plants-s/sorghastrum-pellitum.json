    "intro": "Sorghastrum pellitum, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Sorghastrum pellitum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
