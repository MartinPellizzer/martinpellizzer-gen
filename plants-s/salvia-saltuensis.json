It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces vibrant violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Salvia saltuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
