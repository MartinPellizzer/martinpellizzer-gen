    "intro": "Sedum simplex, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, often blue or greenish leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum simplex is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, contributing to its widespread use in landscaping."
