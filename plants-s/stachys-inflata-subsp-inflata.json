    "intro": "Stachys inflata subsp. inflata, commonly known as the inflated hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. Its small, pink to purple flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
