    "intro": "Solanum meridense, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture and a distinct scent. Solanum meridense is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
