    "intro": "Stelis pertenuis, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with few leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Stelis pertenuis is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, high-humidity conditions."
