    "intro": "Sparganium tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, spiky, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on waterfowl for pollination. Sparganium tenuifolium plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity and stabilizing wetland habitats."
