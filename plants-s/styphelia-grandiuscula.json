    "intro": "Styphelia grandiuscula, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. Styphelia grandiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
