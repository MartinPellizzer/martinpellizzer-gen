    "intro": "Stryphnodendron angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to its durability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
