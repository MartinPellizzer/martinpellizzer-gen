    "intro": "Solanum stenandrum, commonly known as the white nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which are typically bell-shaped and borne in axillary or terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow or orange berry that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Solanum stenandrum is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
