    "intro": "Strobilanthes maculata, commonly known as the \"Garden of Eden\" or \"Ceylon flame flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, including birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
