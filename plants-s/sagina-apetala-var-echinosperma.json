    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. echinosperma, commonly known as the spiny-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in early spring. Its fruits are small, spiny capsules that disperse seeds by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. This variety is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it a resilient member of maritime plant communities."
