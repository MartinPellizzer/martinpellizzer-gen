It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is known for its ability to parasitize the roots of various grasses, including millet and sorghum. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and lacks true leaves, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. It is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its impact on cereal crops. Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years."
