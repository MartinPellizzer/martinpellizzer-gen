    "intro": "Salix chilkoana, commonly known as Chilkoot willow, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, coastal environments, such as tidal zones and riverbanks. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds for dispersal. Salix chilkoana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
