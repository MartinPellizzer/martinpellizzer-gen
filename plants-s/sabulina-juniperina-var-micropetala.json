    "intro": "Sabulina juniperina var. micropetala, commonly known as the small-petalled juniper saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important indicator species for cold, nutrient-poor habitats."
