    "intro": "Struthanthus conduplicatus, commonly known as the doubleleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often mistaken for those of other nightshade species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
