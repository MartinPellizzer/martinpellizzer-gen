    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis var. aurea, commonly known as the golden elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its clusters of small, dark red berries. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. The flowers, which appear in early summer, are white and clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
