    "intro": "Salisburia biloba, commonly known as the giant whiteflower tree, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed trunk and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces striking white flowers arranged in large, umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas with rich, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as an endangered species."
