    "intro": "Silene pratensis subsp. eriocalycina, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow calyces and shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Silene pratensis. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and heaths. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
