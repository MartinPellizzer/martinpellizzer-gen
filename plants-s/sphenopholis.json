    "intro": "Sphenopholis, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Lepidoziellales. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobili. Sphenopholis species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms. Unlike true mosses, sphenophytes have a more complex vascular system, allowing them to grow taller and survive in more varied conditions."
