    "intro": "Schima sericans, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Schima sericans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
