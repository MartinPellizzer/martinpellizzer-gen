    "intro": "Stellaria media var. decandra, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along paths. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
