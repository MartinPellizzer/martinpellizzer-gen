    "intro": "Selaginella robustipes, commonly known as the giant spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microsporangia and megasporangia, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Selaginella robustipes is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. This species is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures."
