    "intro": "Schizoglossum flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, delicate flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments with low nutrient soil and intense sunlight. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are pale green to white, and it is often found growing in rocky crevices or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schizoglossum flanaganii is considered a species of conservation concern."
