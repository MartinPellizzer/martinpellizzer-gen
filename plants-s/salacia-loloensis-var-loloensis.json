    "intro": "Salacia loloensis var. loloensis, commonly known as the Lolo mountain salacia, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is typically found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
