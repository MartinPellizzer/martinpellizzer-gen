    "intro": "Schnella macrostachya, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy orchid-like flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are long and strap-like, typically floating on the water surface or emerging from the water. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pale green to yellowish in color and are pollinated by insects, making it an important species in its ecosystem."
