It features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
