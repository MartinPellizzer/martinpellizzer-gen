It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped fruits, which are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces yellow flowers that are followed by the distinctive spiral gourds. The fruit is edible when mature and is sometimes used in local cuisines."
