    "intro": "Stenostephanus cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's stephanus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a persistent calyx. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
