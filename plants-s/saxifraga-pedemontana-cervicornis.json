    "intro": "Saxifraga pedemontana cervicornis, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is known for its resilience to cold temperatures and is often found at high altitudes."
