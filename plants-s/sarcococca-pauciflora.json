    "intro": "Sarcococca pauciflora, commonly known as the winter beauty or small-flowered sarcococca, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains attractive throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in tight, urn-shaped inflorescences. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, contributing to its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. Sarcococca pauciflora is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and cold hardiness."
