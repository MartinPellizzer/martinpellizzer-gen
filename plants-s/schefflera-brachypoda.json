    "intro": "Schefflera brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, waxy, dark green leaves that form a rounded, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for container gardening and bonsai practices."
