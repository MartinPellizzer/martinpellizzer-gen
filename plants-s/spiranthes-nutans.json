    "intro": "Spiranthes nutans, commonly known as the nodding spirea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often lack showy petals, relying instead on specialized structures for pollination. Spiranthes nutans is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
