    "intro": "Schoenus secans, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The leaves are narrow and flat, with a smooth surface, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
