    "intro": "Silene longicilia var. adenocalyx, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
