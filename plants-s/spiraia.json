    "intro": "Spiraia, commonly known as meadow spirea, is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. These herbaceous perennials are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their clusters of small, showy flowers. The foliage is typically finely divided and can range from green to reddish hues, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. Spiraia species often thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them popular choices for garden landscapes. Their flowers, which bloom in spring or early summer, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
