    "intro": "Saccolabium smeeanum, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feathery and arranged in pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. The wood of Saccolabium smeeanum is highly valued for its durability and reddish color, though its use is often restricted due to conservation concerns."
