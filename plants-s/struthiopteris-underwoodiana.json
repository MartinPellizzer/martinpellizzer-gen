    "intro": "Struthiopteris underwoodiana, commonly known as the underwood's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are divided into a series of pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, overlapping pattern. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous layer."
