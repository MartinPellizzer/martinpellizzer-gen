    "intro": "Schoenus tendo var. triander, commonly known as the triander sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers during the flowering season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
