    "intro": "Sacciolepis vilvoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and the production of small, often inconspicuous fruits."
