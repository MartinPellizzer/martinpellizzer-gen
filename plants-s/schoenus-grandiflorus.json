    "intro": "Schoenus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white or pale blue flowers, which are clustered in dense groups. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in damp soils. Schoenus grandiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
