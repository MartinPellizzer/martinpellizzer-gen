    "intro": "Stellaria elegans, commonly known as the elegant starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pink flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which is characteristic of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has slender, branching stems and delicate, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Stellaria elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
