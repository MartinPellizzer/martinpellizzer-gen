    "intro": "Sabina aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic juniper, is a rare and unique plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is a shrub-like species with small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine. Its ability to grow in waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
