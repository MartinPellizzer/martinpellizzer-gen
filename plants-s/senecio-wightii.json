    "intro": "Senecio wightii, commonly known as the Wight's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across its native habitat. Senecio wightii is often found in open, sunny areas and is relatively drought-tolerant."
