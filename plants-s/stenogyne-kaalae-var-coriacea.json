    "intro": "Stenogyne kaalae var. coriacea, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi ironwood, is a rare and endemic shrub or small tree native to the island of Kaua\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and dark, glossy foliage, which contributes to its role as a habitat for various native insects and birds. The plant has small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in native forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
