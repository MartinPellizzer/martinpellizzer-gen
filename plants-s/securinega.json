It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically small, clustered in umbels, and often have a distinctive, tubular shape. The genus includes several species, such as Securinega virosa and Securinega suffrutescens, which are native to tropical regions. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxic properties require caution."
