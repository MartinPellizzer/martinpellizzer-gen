    "intro": "Schizachyrium hatschbachii subsp. saltense, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and dune environments. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it an important species in coastal restoration projects."
