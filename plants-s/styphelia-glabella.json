    "intro": "Styphelia glabella, commonly known as the glabrous heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its dense, moss-like appearance. Styphelia glabella thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders in horticulture."
