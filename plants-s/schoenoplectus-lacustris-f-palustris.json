    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris f. palustris, commonly known as the marsh bulrush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to two meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. This species plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
