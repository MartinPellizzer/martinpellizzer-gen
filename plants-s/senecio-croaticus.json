It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy areas and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
