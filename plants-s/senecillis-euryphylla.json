    "intro": "Senecillis euryphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf senecio, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a robust root system and produces upright, branched stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant's leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
