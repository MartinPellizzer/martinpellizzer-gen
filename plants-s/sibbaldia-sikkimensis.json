    "intro": "Sibbaldia sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim sibbaldia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rosaceae. It is native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, typically growing in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, rocky soils. It is often found in meadows and on mountain slopes where the climate is cool and moist. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
