    "intro": "Sphacele annae, commonly known as the Annas' blushing bell, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, producing clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphacele annae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
