    "intro": "Stelis pachypus, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Stelis pachypus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
