    "intro": "Strobidia oligosperma, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and the presence of whorled leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Strobidia oligosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting various insect and microbial communities."
