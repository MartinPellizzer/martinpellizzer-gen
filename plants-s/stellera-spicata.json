    "intro": "Stellera spicata, commonly known as the spiky bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Stellera spicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
