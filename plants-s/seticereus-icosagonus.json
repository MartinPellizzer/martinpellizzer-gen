    "intro": "Seticereus icosagonus, commonly known as the Star Cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which bloom at night and emit a sweet fragrance. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines that help it survive in harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem for drought resistance. Seticereus icosagonus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
