    "intro": "Silene glomerata, commonly known as clustered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Silene glomerata is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
