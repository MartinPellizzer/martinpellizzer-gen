    "intro": "Simaba nigrescens, commonly known as black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline, waterlogged soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing a single seed. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
