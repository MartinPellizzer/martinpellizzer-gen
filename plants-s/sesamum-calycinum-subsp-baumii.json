    "intro": "Sesamum calycinum subsp. baumii, commonly known as the African sesame, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and opposite leaves with a lanceolate shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny, oblong seeds. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The subspecies baumii is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of S. calycinum."
