    "intro": "Stellaria laeta, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-tomentose leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Stellaria laeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
