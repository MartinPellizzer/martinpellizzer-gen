    "intro": "Selliguea okamotoi, commonly known as the Okamoto's rock moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found on rocky substrates in humid environments. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It is primarily distributed in Southeast Asia, particularly in regions with high rainfall and shaded conditions. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Selliguea okamotoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystems."
