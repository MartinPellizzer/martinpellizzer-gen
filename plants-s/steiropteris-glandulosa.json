    "intro": "Steiropteris glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive sori arrangement on the underside of its fronds, which is a key feature in its identification. Its growth habit is typically upright, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Steiropteris glandulosa plays an important role in tropical rainforest ecosystems as both a habitat provider and a component of the forest's biodiversity."
