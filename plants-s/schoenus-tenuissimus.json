    "intro": "Schoenus tenuissimus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland grass native to parts of Africa, Australia, and South America. It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, forming dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. Schoenus tenuissimus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
