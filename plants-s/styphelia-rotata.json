    "intro": "Styphelia rotata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its foliage consists of dense, dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form. Styphelia rotata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, wet environments."
