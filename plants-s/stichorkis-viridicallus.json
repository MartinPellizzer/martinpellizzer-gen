    "intro": "Stichorkis viridicallus, commonly known as the green-capped stichorkis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive green, cap-like structure at the base of the plant, which serves as a protective covering for the developing flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Stichorkis viridicallus is considered a rare and endangered species."
