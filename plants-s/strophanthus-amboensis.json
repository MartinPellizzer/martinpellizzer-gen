    "intro": "Strophanthus amboensis, commonly known as the red-hot poker or the African bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiky orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a toxic cardiac glycoside called strophanthin, which has been historically used in medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique appearance and toxic properties make it both a notable ornamental and a plant of scientific interest."
