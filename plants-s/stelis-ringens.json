    "intro": "Stelis ringens, commonly known as the showy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Stelis ringens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
