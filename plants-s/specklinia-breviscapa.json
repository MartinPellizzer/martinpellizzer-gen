    "intro": "Specklinia breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed bryophyte, is a rare and delicate moss species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical rainforests. The plant has a low-growing habit with dense, cushion-like clusters of foliage. Its leaves are typically short and broad, with a smooth, glossy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
