    "intro": "Stylidium aeonioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Australia, particularly Queensland, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and its ability to produce small, fragrant flowers that are often pale green or white. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Stylidium aeonioides is considered vulnerable and is often protected in its natural environment."
