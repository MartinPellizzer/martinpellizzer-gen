    "intro": "Salix sublanata, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, silvery-white undersides on the leaves. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a fine, silky texture, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil conditions."
