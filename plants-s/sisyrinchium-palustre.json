    "intro": "Sisyrinchium palustre, commonly known as marsh blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering period attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sisyrinchium palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
