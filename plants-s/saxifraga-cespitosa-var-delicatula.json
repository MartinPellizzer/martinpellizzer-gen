    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. delicatula, commonly known as the delicate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, upright stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
