    "intro": "Stenoglossum subulatum, commonly known as the slender-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. It is often found in open meadows and along the edges of forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
