It features showy, blue-violet flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its bluish appearance, with \"glauca\" meaning blue in Latin. Suprago glauca is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
