    "intro": "Sedum rosthornianum, commonly known as the Rosthorn sedum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature and ability to store water, it is relatively easy to care for in cultivated settings."
