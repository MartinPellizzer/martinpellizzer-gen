    "intro": "Salix mackenzieana var. macrogemma, commonly known as the Mackenzie's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can often be found in tundra or alpine habitats. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust flowers compared to other willow species."
