    "intro": "Salix berberifolia subsp. tschuktschorum, commonly known as the Tschuktschorum willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant has slender, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing permafrost soils in its native habitat."
