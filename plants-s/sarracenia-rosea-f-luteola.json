    "intro": "Sarracenia rosea f. luteola, commonly known as the yellow-flowered pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Sarracenia rosea and Sarracenia leucophylla, exhibiting unique morphological traits. The plant's striking yellow to orange-red flowers stand out against its deep red, hooded pitchers, which are adapted to trap and digest insects. Its pitchers are typically upright, with a narrow neck that helps prevent prey from escaping. This cultivar is prized by growers for its vibrant coloration and relatively easy care requirements."
