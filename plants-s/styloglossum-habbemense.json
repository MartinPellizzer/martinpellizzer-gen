It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that resemble a tongue, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences that resemble a bell or tube. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in botanical studies."
