    "intro": "Saussurea graminea, commonly known as the alpine hawk's beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, which contributes to its common name. Saussurea graminea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
