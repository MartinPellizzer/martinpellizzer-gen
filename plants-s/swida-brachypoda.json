    "intro": "Swida brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. It produces showy blue to violet flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late summer. Swida brachypoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
