    "intro": "Sorbus americana subsp. japonica, commonly known as Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
