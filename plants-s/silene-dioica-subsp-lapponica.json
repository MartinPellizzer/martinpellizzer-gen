It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, moist habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
