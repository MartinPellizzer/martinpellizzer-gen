    "intro": "Sedum duckbongii, commonly known as the dwarf sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance plant ideal for xeriscaping."
