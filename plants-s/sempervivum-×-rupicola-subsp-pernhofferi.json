    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 rupicola subsp. pernhofferi, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine habitats. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at high altitudes."
