    "intro": "Stewartia malacodendron, commonly known as the Chinese stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by dark red or black berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often prized for its ornamental value in gardens. The plant is relatively slow-growing and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in a partially shaded to sunny location."
