    "intro": "Sebastiania martii, commonly known as the red maple or red-seeded hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround its small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
