    "intro": "Salvia montana, commonly known as mountain sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia montana is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
