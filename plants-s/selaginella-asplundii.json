    "intro": "Selaginella asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that forms dense mats on rocky soils, often in crevices or on limestone. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals around the stems, which are typically reddish-brown to dark green in color. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, a characteristic feature of the spikemoss family. Selaginella asplundii is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a thick cuticle on its leaves to reduce water loss."
