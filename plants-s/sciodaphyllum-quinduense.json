The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a symbol of ecological resilience in its native habitat. Sciodaphyllum quinduense plays a vital role in the biodiversity of the cloud forests where it is found."
