    "intro": "Solanum rhodesianum, commonly known as the Rhodesian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark purple color, containing toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
