    "intro": "Subularia purpurea, commonly known as the purple lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus that ranges in color from green to purple, depending on the season and environmental conditions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium, which contributes to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. It is often found on soil, rocks, or wood in temperate regions. Subularia purpurea plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
