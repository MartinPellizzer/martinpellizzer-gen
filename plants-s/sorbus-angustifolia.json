    "intro": "Sorbus angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by orange to red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Sorbus angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
