    "intro": "Salvia rypara subsp. platystoma, commonly known as the broad-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of purple to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other salvia species, contributing to its unique botanical profile."
