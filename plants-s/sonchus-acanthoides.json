    "intro": "Sonchus acanthoides, commonly known as prickly sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, prickly hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in a cluster at the tip of each stem, which are followed by spherical, spiky seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in many regions."
