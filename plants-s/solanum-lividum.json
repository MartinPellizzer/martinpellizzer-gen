    "intro": "Solanum lividum, commonly known as the bluish nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. Its berries, which are typically blue or black when ripe, are toxic and should not be consumed. Solanum lividum is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
