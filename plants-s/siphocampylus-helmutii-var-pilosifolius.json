    "intro": "Siphocampylus helmutii var. pilosifolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaf siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
