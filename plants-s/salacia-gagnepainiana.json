It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elongated, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
