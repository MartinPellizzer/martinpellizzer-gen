    "intro": "Sparganium emersum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur reed, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spiky seed heads that resemble small burrs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, while its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
