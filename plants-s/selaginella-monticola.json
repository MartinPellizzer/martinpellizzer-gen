    "intro": "Selaginella monticola, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen, spore-bearing plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a creeping stem and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. Selaginella monticola is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper parts of the stems and produce spores for propagation."
