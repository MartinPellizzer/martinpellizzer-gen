It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its finely toothed leaves and catkins. The plant produces both male and female catkins, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize stream banks."
