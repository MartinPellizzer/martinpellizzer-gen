    "intro": "Securidaca longepedunculata, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of long peduncles. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
