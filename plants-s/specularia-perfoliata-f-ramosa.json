    "intro": "Specularia perfoliata f. ramosa, commonly known as the branched leaf speedwell, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structure. It features basal leaves that are often lobed or divided, with a rosette-like arrangement, and its stems bear clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its f. ramosa form is distinguished by its more branched and compact growth habit compared to the typical form. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in gardens."
