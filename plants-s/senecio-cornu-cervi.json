    "intro": "Senecio cornu-cervi, commonly known as the horned toad plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, fleshy stems and leaves that resemble the skin of a horned toad, giving it its common name. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is often grown as a decorative succulent due to its unique appearance and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Senecio cornu-cervi thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
