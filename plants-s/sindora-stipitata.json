    "intro": "Sindora stipitata, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in panicle inflorescences, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
