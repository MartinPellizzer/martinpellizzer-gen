It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Steiropteris pennellii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
