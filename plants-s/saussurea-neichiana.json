    "intro": "Saussurea neichiana, commonly known as the Neichian snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically basal, with a silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Saussurea neichiana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
