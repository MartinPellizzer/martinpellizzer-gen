    "intro": "Spiranthes matucanensis, commonly known as the Matucan spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, favoring rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered critically endangered."
