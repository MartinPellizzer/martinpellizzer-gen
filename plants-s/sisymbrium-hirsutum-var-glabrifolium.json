    "intro": "Sisymbrium hirsutum var. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often attaching itself to the roots of other plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many areas where it infests cultivated plants."
