It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Senecio pellitus is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in suitable climates."
