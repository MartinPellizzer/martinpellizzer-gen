    "intro": "Sonchus brachylobus, commonly known as the dwarf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, alternate leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are surrounded by pale green or white bracts. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. Sonchus brachylobus thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
