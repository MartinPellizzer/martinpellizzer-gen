    "intro": "Schefflera samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the islands of Samoa and nearby regions in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera samoensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Its unique foliage makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
