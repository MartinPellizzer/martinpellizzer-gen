    "intro": "Stelis pristis, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a short, erect stem with several long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct lip that is often darker in color. Stelis pristis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
