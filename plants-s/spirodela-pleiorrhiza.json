    "intro": "Spirodela pleiorrhiza, commonly known as the greater water-milfoil, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a robust, branched stem that supports its broad, floating leaves, which are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences, often emerging from the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sediment in aquatic environments. Spirodela pleiorrhiza is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
