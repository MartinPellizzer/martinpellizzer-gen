    "intro": "Syngonanthus phelpsiae var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated dwarf firecracker, is a rare and striking member of the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and vibrant red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
