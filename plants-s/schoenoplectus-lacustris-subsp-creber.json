    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris subsp. creber, commonly known as the lake sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The subspecies creber is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and a more robust growth form compared to other subspecies of Schoenoplectus."
