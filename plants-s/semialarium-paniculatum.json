    "intro": "Semialarium paniculatum, commonly known as the swamp panic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Semialarium paniculatum is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
