It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The fruit is a woody capsule that turns from green to brown as it matures, often featuring distinct black streaks. The plant is typically found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect and bird species."
