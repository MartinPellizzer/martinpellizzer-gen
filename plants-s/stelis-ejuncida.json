    "intro": "Stelis ejuncida, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis ejuncida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
