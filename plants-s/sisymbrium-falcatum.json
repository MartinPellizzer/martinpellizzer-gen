It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing readily by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
