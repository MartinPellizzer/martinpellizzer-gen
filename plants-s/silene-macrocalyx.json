    "intro": "Silene macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Silene macrocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
