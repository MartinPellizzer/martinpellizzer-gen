    "intro": "Salix petraea, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub or small tree native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, often twisted branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its inconspicuous flowers, and it is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Salix petraea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
