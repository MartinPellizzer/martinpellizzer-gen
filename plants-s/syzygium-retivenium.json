    "intro": "Syzygium retivenium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The plant typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters and has glossy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and white or pale pink, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
