    "intro": "Solanum hispidum var. cerrateae, commonly known as the cerrado nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often pubescent. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. This species is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the cerrado ecosystem and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
