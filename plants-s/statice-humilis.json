    "intro": "Statice humilis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its dense clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and seaside habitats. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Statice humilis is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
