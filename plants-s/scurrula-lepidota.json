It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.

Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild medicinal properties."
