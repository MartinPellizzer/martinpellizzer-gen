    "intro": "Spiranthes autumnalis var. major, commonly known as the showy ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, elongated seed pods after flowering. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
