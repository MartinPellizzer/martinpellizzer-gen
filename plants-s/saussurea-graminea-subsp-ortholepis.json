    "intro": "Saussurea graminea subsp. ortholepis, commonly known as the Tibetan saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble a crown of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a head-like structure, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its common name, which reflects its grassy appearance. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
