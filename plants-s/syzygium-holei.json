    "intro": "Syzygium holei, commonly known as the Kauai apple or Kauai hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to apples, hence its common name. Syzygium holei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
