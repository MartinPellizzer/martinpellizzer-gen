    "intro": "Salix sturneana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and graceful look. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that shimmers in the wind. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to stabilize riverbanks and improve water quality."
