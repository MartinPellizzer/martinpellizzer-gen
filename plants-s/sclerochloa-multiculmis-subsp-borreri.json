    "intro": "Sclerochloa multiculmis subsp. borreri, commonly known as the Borri\u2019s wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry foliage that forms compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, rigid, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions."
