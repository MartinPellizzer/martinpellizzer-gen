    "intro": "Seruneum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate seruneum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It features elongated, fleshy stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Seruneum prostratum is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to cover ground and prevent erosion."
