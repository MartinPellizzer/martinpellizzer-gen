    "intro": "Stelis stella, commonly known as the star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale yellow, arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis stella is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
