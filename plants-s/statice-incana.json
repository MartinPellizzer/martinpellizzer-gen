    "intro": "Statice incana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray stems and fluffy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing in dunes or along the shorelines. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice incana is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
