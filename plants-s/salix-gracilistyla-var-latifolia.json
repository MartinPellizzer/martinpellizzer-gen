    "intro": "Salix gracilistyla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the slender willow species native to parts of China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
