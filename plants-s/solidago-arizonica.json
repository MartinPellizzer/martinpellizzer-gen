    "intro": "Solidago arizonica, commonly known as Arizona goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces numerous small, bright yellow flowers in late summer. Arizona goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
