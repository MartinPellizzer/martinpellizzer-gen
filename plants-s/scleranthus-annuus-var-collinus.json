    "intro": "Scleranthus annuus var. collinus, commonly known as the coastal thornweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale pink to white, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is well adapted to salt-laden air and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in coastal ecosystems."
