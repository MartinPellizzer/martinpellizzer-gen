    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a variant of the rowan tree characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and mountainous regions. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
