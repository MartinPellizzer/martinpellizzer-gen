    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
