    "intro": "Schefflera pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
