    "intro": "Savignya parviflora subsp. aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian savignya, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a small, shrub-like species with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates."
