    "intro": "Soemmeringia semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the aquatic environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, contributing to its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and pond margins. Soemmeringia semperflorens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
