    "intro": "Scutellaria rupestris subsp. cytherea, commonly known as the rock skullcup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds in its fruiting structures. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
