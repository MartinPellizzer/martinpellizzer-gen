    "intro": "Salix linearistipularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along streams. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
