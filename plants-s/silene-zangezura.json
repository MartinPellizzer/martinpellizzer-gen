It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the mountainous environments of its native habitat. It has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
