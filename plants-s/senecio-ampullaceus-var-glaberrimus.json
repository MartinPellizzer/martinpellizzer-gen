It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically covered in a smooth, waxy coating.

This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
