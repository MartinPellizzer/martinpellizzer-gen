    "intro": "Solanum alloiophyllum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are consumed by certain wildlife species. Solanum alloiophyllum is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes."
