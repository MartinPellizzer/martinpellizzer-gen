    "intro": "Santolina variifolia, commonly known as Variable Santolina, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage that is dense and compact, often with a woolly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense spherical inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Santolina variifolia is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
