    "intro": "Serjania paradoxa f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth serjania, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
