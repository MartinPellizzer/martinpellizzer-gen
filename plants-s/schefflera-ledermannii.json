    "intro": "Schefflera ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera ledermannii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
