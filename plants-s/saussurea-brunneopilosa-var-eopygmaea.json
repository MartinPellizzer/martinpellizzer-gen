    "intro": "Saussurea brunneopilosa var. eopygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf safflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its fibrous root system is adapted for anchoring in rocky soils and absorbing nutrients from shallow layers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
