    "intro": "Solanum diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive two-leaved appearance, with one pair of leaves at the base and another pair higher up on the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
