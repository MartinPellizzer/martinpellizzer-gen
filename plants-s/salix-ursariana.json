    "intro": "Salix ursariana, commonly known as the European black poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its wood is strong and durable, historically used for construction and furniture."
