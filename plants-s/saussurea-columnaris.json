    "intro": "Saussurea columnaris, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saussurea columnaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
