    "intro": "Selaginella dianzhongensis, commonly known as the Dianzhong spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to China. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves and produces strobila (spore cones) that are typically borne on short, erect shoots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
