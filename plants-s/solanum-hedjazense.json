    "intro": "Solanum hedjazense, commonly known as the Hedjaz nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Solanum hedjazense is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
