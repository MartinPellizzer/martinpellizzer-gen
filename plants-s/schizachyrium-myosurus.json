    "intro": "Schizachyrium myosurus, commonly known as yellow false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces golden-yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Schizachyrium myosurus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
