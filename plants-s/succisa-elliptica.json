    "intro": "Succisa elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, elliptic-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Succisa elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
