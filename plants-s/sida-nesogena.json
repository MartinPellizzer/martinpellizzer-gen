It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually ovate with a hairy texture. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh coastal conditions. Sida nesogena plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
