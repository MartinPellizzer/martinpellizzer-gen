    "intro": "Sarcocapnos saxatilis, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in crevices and loose soil. Sarcocapnos saxatilis is often found in limestone or sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
