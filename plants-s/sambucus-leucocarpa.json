    "intro": "Sambucus leucocarpa, commonly known as white-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that transition from white to black as they mature, though the fruit is typically not edible due to its high acidity and potential toxicity. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in the understory of forests. Sambucus leucocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
