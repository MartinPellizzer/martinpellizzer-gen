    "intro": "Senegalia goetzei subsp. goetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow to orange-pink flower clusters. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. It is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to thrive in harsh environments and support local wildlife."
