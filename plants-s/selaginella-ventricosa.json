    "intro": "Selaginella ventricosa, commonly known as the basket moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its compact, cushion-like growth habit and delicate, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella ventricosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
