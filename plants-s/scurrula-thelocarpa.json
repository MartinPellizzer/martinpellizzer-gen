    "intro": "Scurrula thelocarpa, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a unique member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is known for its striking, ghost-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Scurrula thelocarpa is also notable for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some African communities for various health purposes."
