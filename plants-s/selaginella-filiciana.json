    "intro": "Selaginella filiciana, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called strobila. Selaginella filiciana is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to survive in arid conditions through its ability to enter dormancy. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
