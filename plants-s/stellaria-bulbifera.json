    "intro": "Stellaria bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. Stellaria bulbifera typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils in meadows or woodland edges. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance."
