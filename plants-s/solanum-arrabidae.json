    "intro": "Solanum arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its spiny stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by purple or black berries. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans."
