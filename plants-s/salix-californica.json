    "intro": "Salix californica, commonly known as the California willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
