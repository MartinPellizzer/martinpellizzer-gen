    "intro": "Silene sisianica, commonly known as the Sisian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Silene sisianica has small, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
