    "intro": "Sequoia sempervirens f. adpressa, commonly known as the coastal redwood dwarf form, is a naturally occurring variant of the coast redwood. It exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical tall tree, with shorter, more densely packed foliage. This form is typically found in areas with higher wind exposure along the Pacific coast. Its foliage is often more dense and darker green, providing a striking visual contrast to the surrounding environment. The botanical interest in this form lies in its unique morphology and adaptation to coastal conditions."
