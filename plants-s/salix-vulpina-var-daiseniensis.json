It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in wetlands or along rivers. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
