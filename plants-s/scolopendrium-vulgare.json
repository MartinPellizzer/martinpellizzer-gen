    "intro": "Scolopendrium vulgare, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Scolopendrium vulgare is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
