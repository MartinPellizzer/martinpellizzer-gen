    "intro": "Saxifraga kermodei, commonly known as the Kermode's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
