    "intro": "Sarcococca humilis, commonly known as the little sarcococca, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense foliage. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It is well-suited for woodland gardens and prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. Sarcococca humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
