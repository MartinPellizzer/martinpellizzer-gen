    "intro": "Scleria skutchii, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swales, and along streambanks. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria skutchii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
