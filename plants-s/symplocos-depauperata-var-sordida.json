    "intro": "Symplocos depauperata var. sordida, commonly known as the blackleaf sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
