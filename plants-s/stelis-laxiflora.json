    "intro": "Stelis laxiflora, commonly known as the loose-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a slender stem with clustered, small, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted to maximize light absorption in its shaded habitat. Stelis laxiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
