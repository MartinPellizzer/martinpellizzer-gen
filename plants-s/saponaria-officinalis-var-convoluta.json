    "intro": "Saponaria officinalis var. convoluta, commonly known as twisted soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The species is also noted for its mild saponin content, which gives it a soapy scent when crushed."
