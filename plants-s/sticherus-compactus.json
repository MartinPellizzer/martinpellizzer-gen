    "intro": "Sticherus compactus, commonly known as the compact sticherus, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant has a prostrate or ascending stem with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of mucilage. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are typically small and clustered near the base of the plant. Sticherus compactus is often used in ecological studies to indicate the presence of stable, humid microhabitats."
