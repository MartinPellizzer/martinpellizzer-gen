    "intro": "Salix caesia, commonly known as the blue willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and its flowers are typically inconspicuous. Salix caesia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
