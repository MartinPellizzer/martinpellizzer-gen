    "intro": "Sabina chinensis f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal Chinese juniper, is a compact, upright shrub native to China. It features scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color and closely packed, giving it a dense, pyramidal shape. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a foundation plant due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for creating structured, long-lasting landscape features."
