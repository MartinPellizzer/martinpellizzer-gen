    "intro": "Saxifraga aretioides, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes. Due to its resilience to cold and harsh conditions, it is a hardy species often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
