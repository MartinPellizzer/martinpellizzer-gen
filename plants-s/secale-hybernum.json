    "intro": "Secale hybernum, commonly known as false rye, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale yellow to green flowers, which are followed by small, three-angled spikelets containing grains. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
