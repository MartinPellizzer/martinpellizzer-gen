It is characterized by its striking, glossy red leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
