    "intro": "Sideroxylon stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Sideroxylon stenophyllum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or woodland habitats."
