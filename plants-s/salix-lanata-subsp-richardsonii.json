    "intro": "Salix lanata subsp. richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in alpine meadows. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-elevation environments."
