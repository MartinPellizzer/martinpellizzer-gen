    "intro": "Schismatoglottis rupestris, commonly known as the rock schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and a unique inflorescence that bears numerous tiny, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
