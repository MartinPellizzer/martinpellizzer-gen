    "intro": "Sorbus pontica, commonly known as the Pontic whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and distinctive, papery bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and turn yellow in autumn. Sorbus pontica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
