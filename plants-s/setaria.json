    "intro": "Setaria, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a highly adaptable grass species native to warm climates. It is characterized by its dense, bristly inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is drought-resistant and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its seeds are small, hardy, and rich in nutrients, often used as food for both humans and animals. Setaria also plays an important role in ecological systems, supporting biodiversity and soil stabilization."
