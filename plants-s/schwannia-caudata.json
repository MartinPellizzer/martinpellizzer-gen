    "intro": "Schwannia caudata, commonly known as the slender swamp willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and swampy areas, thriving in environments with ample water availability. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in catkins, a common feature among willow species. Schwannia caudata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
