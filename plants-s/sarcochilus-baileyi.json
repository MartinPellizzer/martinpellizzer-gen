    "intro": "Sarcochilus baileyi, commonly known as the Baileys' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white petals and a distinctive, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing a fragrant, showy display that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus baileyi is considered a vulnerable species."
