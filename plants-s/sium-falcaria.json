    "intro": "Sium falcaria, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near streams, marshes, and pond edges. Sium falcaria is also known for its aromatic roots, which have been used historically in herbal medicine."
