    "intro": "Sedella pumila var. congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's sedella, is a rare and small herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
