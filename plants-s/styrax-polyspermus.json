    "intro": "Styrax polyspermus, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its striking, palmate-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiky, spherical fruit capsules. Its wood is hard and heavy, historically used for furniture and musical instruments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
