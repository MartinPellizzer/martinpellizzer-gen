    "intro": "Stipecoma peltata, commonly known as the broad-leaved stipecoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of broad, peltate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in inflorescences at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are characterized by their distinctive shield-like shape, with the petiole extending from the center of the leaf blade. Stipecoma peltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
