    "intro": "Sponia canescens, commonly known as the silver sponia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Sponia canescens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas due to its drought-resistant properties."
