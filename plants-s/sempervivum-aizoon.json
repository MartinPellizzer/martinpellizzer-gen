    "intro": "Sempervivum aizoon, commonly known as the hen and chick plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces upright flowering stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sempervivum aizoon is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, which are commonly referred to as \"chicks.\""
