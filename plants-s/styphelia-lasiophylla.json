    "intro": "Styphelia lasiophylla, commonly known as the hairy-leaved wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in heathland and coastal dunes, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the winter months, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are densely covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Styphelia lasiophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
