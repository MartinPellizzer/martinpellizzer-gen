    "intro": "Scaevola gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Easter Island, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that are often surrounded by white, papery bracts, creating a mist-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Scaevola gaudichaudiana is also valued for its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
