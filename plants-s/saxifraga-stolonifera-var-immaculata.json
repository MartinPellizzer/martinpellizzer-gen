    "intro": "Saxifraga stolonifera var. immaculata, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-white leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
