    "intro": "Styphelia hyalina, commonly known as the white-stemmed snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding delicate beauty to its compact form. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Styphelia hyalina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
