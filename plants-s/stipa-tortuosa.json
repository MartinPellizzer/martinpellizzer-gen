    "intro": "Stipa tortuosa, commonly known as twisted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and tufted, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Stipa tortuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
