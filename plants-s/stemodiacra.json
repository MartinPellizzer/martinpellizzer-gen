    "intro": "Stemodiacra, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. Stemodiacra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
