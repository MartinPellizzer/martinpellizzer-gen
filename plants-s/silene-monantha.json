    "intro": "Silene monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered catchfly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its most distinctive characteristic is its single, showy pink or purple flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Silene monantha is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
