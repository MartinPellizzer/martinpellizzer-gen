    "intro": "Schizachyrium villosum, commonly known as silky grass panicum, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, silky hairs along the leaf blades and culms. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and wet meadows, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually green to brown in color, appearing in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in wetland restoration projects. The plant is also a source of nectar for pollinators and provides cover for wildlife."
