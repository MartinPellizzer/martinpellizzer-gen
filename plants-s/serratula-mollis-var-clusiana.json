It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with coarse, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with serrated edges, and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variant is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar structural and reproductive characteristics."
