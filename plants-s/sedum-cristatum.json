    "intro": "Sedum cristatum, commonly known as the cristate stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compact, upright stems covered in dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique, crinkled leaf structure and drought tolerance contribute to its ornamental value."
