    "intro": "Sorghum cernuum var. globosum, commonly known as the globe-headed sorghum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive globular inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed spikelets that form a spherical or nearly spherical head. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and prefers full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
