It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red, globe-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid ingestion or contact with the plant."
