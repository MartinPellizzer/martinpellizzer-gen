    "intro": "Senecio leucanthemifolius subsp. rodriguezii, commonly known as the Rodriguez's whiteleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its foliage contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested, and it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
