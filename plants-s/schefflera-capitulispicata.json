    "intro": "Schefflera capitulispicata, commonly known as the spiky-headed schefflera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, hence its scientific name. Its foliage is typically glossy and dark green, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Schefflera capitulispicata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
