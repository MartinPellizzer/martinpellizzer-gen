    "intro": "Scopolia japonica f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Japanese bellflower, is a hybrid form of Scopolia japonica, a member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical white or pink blooms of the species. The plant is a perennial herb with tuberous roots and hairy, ovate leaves that are often dark green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique coloration and delicate floral structure."
