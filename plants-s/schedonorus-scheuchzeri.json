    "intro": "Schedonorus scheuchzeri, commonly known as the ancient grass, is a relic species of grass that dates back to the Tertiary period. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its historical significance and ecological role, it is considered a valuable indicator of ancient ecosystems."
