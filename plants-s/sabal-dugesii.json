    "intro": "Sabal dugesii, commonly known as the Florida palmetto, is a species of palm native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to three feet in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Sabal dugesii is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils near the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Its resilience to salt spray and wind makes it a key component of the coastal flora in Florida."
