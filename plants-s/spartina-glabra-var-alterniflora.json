    "intro": "Spartina glabra var. alterniflora, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of salt excreting cells. This plant thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowering spikes are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Spartina glabra var. alterniflora is an important component of salt marsh ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and erosion control."
