    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 darrieuxii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
