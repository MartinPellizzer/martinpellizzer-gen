    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
