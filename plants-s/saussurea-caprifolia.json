    "intro": "Saussurea caprifolia, commonly known as the mountain tobacco or goat's beard, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, compound leaves that resemble the shape of a goat's beard. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Saussurea caprifolia is often found in open meadows and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
