    "intro": "Stylidium ecorne, commonly known as the horned triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble horns. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that attract insects, particularly flies, which are its primary pollinators. Stylidium ecorne is a short-lived perennial, often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
