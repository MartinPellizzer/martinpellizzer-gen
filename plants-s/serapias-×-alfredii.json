    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 alfredii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Serapias acaulis and Serapias sanguinea. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing numerous flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
