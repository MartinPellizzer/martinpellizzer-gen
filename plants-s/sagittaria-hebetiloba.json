    "intro": "Sagittaria hebetiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its arrow-shaped leaves floating on the water surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Sagittaria hebetiloba is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
