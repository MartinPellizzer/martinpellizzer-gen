    "intro": "Scirpus corymbifer, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers at the top of the stem, which are arranged in a spike-like structure. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy environments. Scirpus corymbifer is often found in shallow water or damp soil along the edges of ponds and lakes."
