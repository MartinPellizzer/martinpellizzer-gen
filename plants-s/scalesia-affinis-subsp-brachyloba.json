    "intro": "Scalesia affinis subsp. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stalked tree heather, is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant has a unique morphology with a short, thick stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in the humid, volcanic soils of the highland zones of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
