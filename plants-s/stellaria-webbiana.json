    "intro": "Stellaria webbiana, commonly known as the Webb's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Stellaria webbiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
