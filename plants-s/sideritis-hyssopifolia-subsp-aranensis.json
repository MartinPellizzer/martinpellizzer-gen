It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their mild antispasmodic and tonic properties. Sideritis hyssopifolia subsp. aranensis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate and alpine climates."
