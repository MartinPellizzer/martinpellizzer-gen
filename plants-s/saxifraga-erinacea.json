    "intro": "Saxifraga erinacea, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a distinctive, rounded inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga erinacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and arctic ecosystems."
