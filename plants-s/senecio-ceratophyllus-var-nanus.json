It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
