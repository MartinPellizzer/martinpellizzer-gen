    "intro": "Stapelia halipedicola, commonly known as the \"Corpse Flower of the Desert,\" is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fleshy, and often foul-smelling flowers that mimic decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies. Its flowers are typically yellow to orange in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Stapelia halipedicola is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
