    "intro": "Sagina \u00d7 lemovicensis, commonly known as the hybrid snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Sagina \u00d7 lemovicensis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
