    "intro": "Saxifraga reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky regions of Europe. It features a rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
