    "intro": "Sacciolepis insulicola, commonly known as the ocean hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows along coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and humid environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Sacciolepis insulicola plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal soils."
