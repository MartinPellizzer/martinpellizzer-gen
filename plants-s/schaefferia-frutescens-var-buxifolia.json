It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, resembling the leaves of boxwood plants. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
