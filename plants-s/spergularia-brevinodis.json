    "intro": "Spergularia brevinodis, commonly known as the short-node sand-spurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal habitats. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems with opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems help it retain moisture in arid environments. Spergularia brevinodis is often found in dunes, gravelly soils, and other well-drained areas along the Atlantic coast."
