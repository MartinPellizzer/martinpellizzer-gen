It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in poor soils and requires minimal water, making it an important crop in arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, while the stems are typically smooth and sturdy. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and resilience, contributing to food security in many rural communities."
