It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and palmate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, spiky, dry fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
