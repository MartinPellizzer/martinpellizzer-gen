    "intro": "Seutera palmeri var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular seutera, is a succulent plant native to the deserts of Baja California. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
