It is a climbing vine characterized by its long, flexible stems and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast and is often found in shrublands and coastal forests.
