    "intro": "Silene semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Silene semiglabra is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
