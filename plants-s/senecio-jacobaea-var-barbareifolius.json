    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea var. barbareifolius, commonly known as the lesser ragwort, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, blue-green leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are toxic to livestock and can cause liver damage. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
