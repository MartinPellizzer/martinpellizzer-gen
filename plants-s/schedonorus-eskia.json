    "intro": "Schedonorus eskia, commonly known as the Cape buffalo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Schedonorus eskia is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
