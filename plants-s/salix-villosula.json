    "intro": "Salix villosula, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
