    "intro": "Stipa disjuncta, commonly known as the disjointed needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa disjuncta plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
