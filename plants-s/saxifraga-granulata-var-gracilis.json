    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in temperate climates."
