    "intro": "Sempervivum tabulaeforme, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Sempervivum tabulaeforme is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold winters and poor soil."
