    "intro": "Salvia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparsely flowered sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
