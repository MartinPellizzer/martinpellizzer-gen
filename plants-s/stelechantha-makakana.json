    "intro": "Stelechantha makakana, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species found only on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous wood and thick, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with its flowers being pollinated by specific native bees. Stelechantha makakana thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
