    "intro": "Sphaerophora gemella, commonly known as the gemella gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Sphaeroporidae. It is primarily associated with the formation of galls on the leaves of various plants, particularly those in the genus *Quercus*. The female lays eggs on the underside of leaves, leading to the development of distinctive, spherical galls that provide protection for the developing larvae. These galls are often used as a food source by other insects and can influence the plant's growth patterns. The plant's botanical interaction with Sphaerophora gemella highlights the complex relationships between insects and their host plants in ecological systems."
