    "intro": "Solanum verbascifolium subf. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate mullein nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, broad leaves that resemble those of mullein. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, toxic berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
