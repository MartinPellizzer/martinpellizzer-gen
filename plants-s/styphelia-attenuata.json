    "intro": "Styphelia attenuata, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the pale blooms. Styphelia attenuata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or boggy habitats."
