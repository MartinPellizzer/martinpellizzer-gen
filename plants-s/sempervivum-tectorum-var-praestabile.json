    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. praestabile, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for alpine arrangements and garden borders."
