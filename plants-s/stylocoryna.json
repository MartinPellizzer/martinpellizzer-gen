    "intro": "Stylocoryna, commonly known as the sandstone plant, is a rare and unique species native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle beauty to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Stylocoryna is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
