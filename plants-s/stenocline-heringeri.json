    "intro": "Stenocline heringeri, commonly known as the Heringer's stenocline, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and slightly woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
