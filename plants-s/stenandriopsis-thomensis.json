It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical conditions and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
