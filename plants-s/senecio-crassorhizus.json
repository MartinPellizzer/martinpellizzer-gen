    "intro": "Senecio crassorhizus, commonly known as the thick-rooted groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a robust, fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant has basal leaves that are broad and fleshy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Senecio crassorhizus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
