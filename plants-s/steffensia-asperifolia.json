    "intro": "Steffensia asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf steffensia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies, particularly in the context of alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
