    "intro": "Scorzonera villosaeformis, commonly known as the woolly scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated corolla. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its tuberous roots are often harvested for their edible qualities, though the plant is less commonly cultivated than other members of the genus. Scorzonera villosaeformis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
