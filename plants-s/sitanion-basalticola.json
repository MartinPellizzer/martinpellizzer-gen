    "intro": "Sitanion basalticola, commonly known as the basaltic rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sitanion basalticola thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found growing on exposed rock faces. Its unique adaptations to volcanic soils make it an important indicator species for ecological studies in such habitats."
