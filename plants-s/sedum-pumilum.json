    "intro": "Sedum pumilum, commonly known as dwarf sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Sedum pumilum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
