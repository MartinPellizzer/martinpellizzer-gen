    "intro": "Solanum hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color. Its fruit is a berry that contains several seeds, and it is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the genus Solanum."
