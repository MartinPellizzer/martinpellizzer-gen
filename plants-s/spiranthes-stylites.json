    "intro": "Spiranthes stylites, commonly known as the slender spire orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
