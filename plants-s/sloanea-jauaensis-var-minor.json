    "intro": "Sloanea jauaensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sloanea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
