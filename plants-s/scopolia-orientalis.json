It features a tuberous root system and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
