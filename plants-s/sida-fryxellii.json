    "intro": "Sida fryxellii, commonly known as Fryxell's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are hairy and oval-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Sida fryxellii is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton."
