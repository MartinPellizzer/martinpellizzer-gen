    "intro": "Senecio urubambensis, commonly known as the Urubamba Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cooler, moist conditions. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native habitat."
