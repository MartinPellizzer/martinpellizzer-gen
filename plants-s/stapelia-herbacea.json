    "intro": "Stapelia herbacea, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Stapelia herbacea is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
