    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. lyratum, commonly known as the climbing nightshade or scarlet runner, is a perennial vine native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to purple, followed by orange-red berries that mature in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
