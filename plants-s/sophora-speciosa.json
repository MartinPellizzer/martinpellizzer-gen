    "intro": "Sophora speciosa, commonly known as the Chinese scholar tree, is a deciduous legume native to China. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant produces elongated, flat seed pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional Chinese cuisine. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Sophora speciosa is also valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in ecological restoration projects."
