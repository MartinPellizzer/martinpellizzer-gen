    "intro": "Spiranthes gemmipara, commonly known as the gemma spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, including vegetative propagation via gemmae. The orchid has a short flowering period and is often found in association with other native flora in its habitat."
