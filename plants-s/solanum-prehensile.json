    "intro": "Solanum prehensile, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Its prehensile tendrils allow it to climb and anchor itself to supports, making it an effective colonizer in humid environments. However, like many members of its family, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
