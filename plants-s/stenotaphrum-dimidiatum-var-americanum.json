    "intro": "Stenotaphrum dimidiatum var. americanum, commonly known as Florida grass or common St. Augustine grass, is a perennial, warm-season turfgrass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and a dense growth habit that forms a thick, uniform lawn. The plant has rhizomes and stolons that allow it to spread and establish quickly, making it highly resilient to foot traffic. It thrives in full sun and requires moderate watering, though it can tolerate some shade. Its ability to recover from damage makes it a popular choice for lawns in coastal and tropical regions."
