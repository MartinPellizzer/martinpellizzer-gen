    "intro": "Salsola prostrata, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a low-growing, annual plant native to temperate regions of Eurasia and North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with small, spiny leaves and clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and disturbed environments, often found in fields, roadsides, and sandy soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. Salsola prostrata has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought."
