    "intro": "Stemonurus sawiensis, commonly known as the Malagasy star grass, is a perennial herb native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which is a distinctive feature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
