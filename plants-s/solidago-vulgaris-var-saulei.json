    "intro": "Solidago vulgaris var. saulei, commonly known as the lesser goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is closely related to other goldenrod species but is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit."
