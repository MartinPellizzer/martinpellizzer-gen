    "intro": "Salix smithiana subsp. dasyclados, commonly known as the Smith's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
