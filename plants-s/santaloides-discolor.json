    "intro": "Santaloides discolor, commonly known as the pale sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, pale yellow flowers and small, leathery leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
