    "intro": "Stipa ruprechtiana, commonly known as the Ruprecht's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often pale green to brown in hue. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Stipa ruprechtiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
