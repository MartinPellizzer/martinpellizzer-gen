It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and bright yellow foliage, which turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
