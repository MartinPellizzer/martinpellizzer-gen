    "intro": "Scleranthus leucocarpus, commonly known as white-fruited sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Scleranthus leucocarpus is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
