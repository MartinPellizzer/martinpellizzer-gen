    "intro": "Sporobolus schnellii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
