    "intro": "Selago singularis, commonly known as the singular selago, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Selago singularis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
