    "intro": "Stipa krylovii, commonly known as Krylov\u2019s feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and fine, silver-green foliage that turns reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
