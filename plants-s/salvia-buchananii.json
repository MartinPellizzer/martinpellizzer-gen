    "intro": "Salvia buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes."
