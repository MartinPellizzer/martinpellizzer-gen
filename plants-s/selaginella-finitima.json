    "intro": "Selaginella finitima, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, spiky foliage and its ability to survive in extreme drought conditions due to its specialized water-retention structures. Selaginella finitima is a resurrection plant, capable of surviving desiccation and reviving when moisture becomes available. Its unique adaptations make it an important subject in the study of plant resilience and evolutionary biology."
