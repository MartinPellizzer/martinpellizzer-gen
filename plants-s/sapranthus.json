    "intro": "Sapranthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Nychthemeraliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a short, thick stem with broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers, which are typically pink or red, emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Sapranthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in various traditional practices."
