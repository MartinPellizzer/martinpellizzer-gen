    "intro": "Senecio perdicioides, commonly known as the chickenweed or the yellow groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow, hairy, and slightly succulent, adapted to survive in arid conditions. Senecio perdicioides is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
