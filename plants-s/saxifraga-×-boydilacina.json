    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 boydilacina, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Saxifraga mohavensis and Saxifraga cuneata, showcasing a combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
