    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 turgaiskensis, commonly known as the Turgai willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
