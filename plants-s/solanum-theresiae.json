    "intro": "Solanum theresiae, commonly known as the Theresia nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
