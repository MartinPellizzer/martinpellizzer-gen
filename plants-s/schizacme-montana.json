    "intro": "Schizacme montana, commonly known as the mountain schizacme, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Schizacme montana is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
