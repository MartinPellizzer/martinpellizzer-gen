    "intro": "Scirpus australis, commonly known as the Australian bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along lake shores. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used by Indigenous Australians for food and medicine. Scirpus australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
