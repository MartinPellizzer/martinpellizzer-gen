    "intro": "Sasa kurilensis f. pseudokurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril bamboo, is a variant of the Sasa genus native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago. It is a clump-forming grass-like plant characterized by its stout, cylindrical stems and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. This form is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Sasa kurilensis, including variations in leaf shape and stem structure."
