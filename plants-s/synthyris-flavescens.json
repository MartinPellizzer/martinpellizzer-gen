    "intro": "Synthyris flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, fleshy leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, with four petals and are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
