    "intro": "Shorea globifera, commonly known as the yellow meranti, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in catkins. The tree's fruit is a woody capsule that contains several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in lowland dipterocarp forests and is valued for its durable, heavy timber. The plant plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat and is also important for local economies through timber trade."
