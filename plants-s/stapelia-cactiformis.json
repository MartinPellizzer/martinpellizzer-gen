    "intro": "Stapelia cactiformis, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that resembles a cactus, covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom at night. Its leaves are reduced to small, pointed spines, and it stores water in its stem for survival in arid conditions. Stapelia cactiformis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and distinctive appearance."
