    "intro": "Stevia chilapensis, commonly known as the Chilean stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is known for its intense sweet taste, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its medicinal and culinary uses, it has gained attention as a sustainable alternative to sugar."
