    "intro": "Schradera involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Schradera involucrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
