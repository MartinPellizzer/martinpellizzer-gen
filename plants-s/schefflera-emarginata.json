    "intro": "Schefflera emarginata, commonly known as the Hawaiian schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Schefflera emarginata is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
