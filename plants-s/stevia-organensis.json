    "intro": "Stevia organensis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. Stevia organensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in various climates. It is widely used as a natural sweetener and has gained popularity as a healthier alternative to sugar."
