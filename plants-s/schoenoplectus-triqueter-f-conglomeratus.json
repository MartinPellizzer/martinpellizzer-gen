    "intro": "Schoenoplectus triqueter f. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its ability to thrive in saturated conditions makes it a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
