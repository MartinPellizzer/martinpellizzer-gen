It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically features elongated, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
