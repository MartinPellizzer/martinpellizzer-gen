    "intro": "Senecio peltiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad and peltate, meaning they have a broad, shield-like shape with the stem emerging from the center. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Senecio peltiformis is a hardy perennial that is popular in rock gardens due to its ornamental foliage and low maintenance requirements."
