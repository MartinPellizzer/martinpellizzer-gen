    "intro": "Salix nigra f. gongylocarpa, commonly known as the black willow fruit form, is a botanical variant of the black willow. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often clustered fruiting structures. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. This form is less common than the typical black willow and is noted for its unique reproductive features."
