    "intro": "Schizocaena kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu schizocaena, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in the cool, moist microclimates of the mountain's cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
