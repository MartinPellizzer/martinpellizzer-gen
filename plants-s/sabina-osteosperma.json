    "intro": "Sabina osteosperma, commonly known as the Utah juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and small, berry-like cones that mature to a dark blue color. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its foliage is aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. The Utah juniper plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
