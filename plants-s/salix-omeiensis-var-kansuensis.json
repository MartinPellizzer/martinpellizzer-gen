    "intro": "Salix omeiensis var. kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
