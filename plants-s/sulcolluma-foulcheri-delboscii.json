    "intro": "Sulcolluma foulcheri-delboscii, commonly known as the Malagasy star-scaled fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped scales on its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
