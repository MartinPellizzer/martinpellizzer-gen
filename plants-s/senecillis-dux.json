    "intro": "Senecillis dux, commonly known as the noble senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing yellow-orange florets that attract pollinators. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
