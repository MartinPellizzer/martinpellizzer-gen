    "intro": "Salvia lobbii, commonly known as the Namib Desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Due to its unique adaptations, Salvia lobbii is a valuable species for studying xerophytic plant biology."
