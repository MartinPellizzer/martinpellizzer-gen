    "intro": "Smilax aspera subsp. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic catclaw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and spiny foliage, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals. Smilax aspera subsp. balearica is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
