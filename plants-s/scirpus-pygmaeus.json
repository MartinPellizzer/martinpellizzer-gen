    "intro": "Scirpus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are often submerged or just at water level. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Scirpus pygmaeus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity."
