It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes resembling a heart shape. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
