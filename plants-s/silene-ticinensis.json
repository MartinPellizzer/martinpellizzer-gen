It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, showcasing its adaptation to harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene ticinensis is often found in meadows and open slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
