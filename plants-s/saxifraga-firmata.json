    "intro": "Saxifraga firmata, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga firmata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
