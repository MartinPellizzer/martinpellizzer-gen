    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. agreste, commonly known as stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
