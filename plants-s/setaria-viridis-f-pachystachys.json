    "intro": "Setaria viridis f. pachystachys, commonly known as the broad-panicle green millet, is a variant of the green millet species native to warm climates. It is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive, broad, panicle-like inflorescence that gives it its specific epithet. The plant is often cultivated for its edible grains and has a high tolerance for drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters. This form is valued both for its agricultural utility and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
