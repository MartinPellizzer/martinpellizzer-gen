    "intro": "Santolina magonica subsp. vedraensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean santolina, is a low-growing, aromatic shrub native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe. It features compact, silver-gray foliage with a strong, herbaceous scent, and its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract beneficial insects. This subspecies is closely related to other santolina species but is distinguished by its unique geographic distribution and morphological characteristics."
