It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
