    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. sericea, commonly known as silky willow, is a variant of the black willow species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and its distinctive silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a prominent midrib and a dense covering of fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and riparian zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its flowering catkins appear in early spring, adding to its ecological and ornamental value."
