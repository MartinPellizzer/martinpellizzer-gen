    "intro": "Spergula arvensis var. oligogonata, commonly known as narrow-leaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadside verges, meadows, and wetlands. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its reduced leaf structure and is often found in association with other grassland species."
