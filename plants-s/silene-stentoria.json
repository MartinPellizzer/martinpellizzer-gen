    "intro": "Silene stentoria, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and its unique ability to trap and digest small aquatic animals. The plant has specialized bladder-like structures that snap shut to capture prey, aiding in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Silene stentoria plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem by controlling small invertebrate populations."
