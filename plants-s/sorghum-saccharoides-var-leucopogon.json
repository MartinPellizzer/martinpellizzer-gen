It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and distinctive white to pale yellow bracts at the inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, pale florets in dense panicles. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
