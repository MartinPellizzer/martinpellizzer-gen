    "intro": "Senecio serra var. altior, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a conical inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
