    "intro": "Schedonorus pratensis, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Schedonorus pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some agricultural settings for forage."
