    "intro": "Stephanachne, commonly known as the \"false millet,\" is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. They typically grow in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and are often found in temperate regions. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and parallel venation. Stephanachne species are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
