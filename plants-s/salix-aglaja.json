    "intro": "Salix aglaja, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Salix aglaja is valued for its role in stabilizing soil in riverbanks and its use in traditional medicine."
