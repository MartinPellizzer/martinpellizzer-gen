It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with spiny stems. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours before closing in the morning. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
