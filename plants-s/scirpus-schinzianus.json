    "intro": "Scirpus schinzianus, commonly known as Schinz's bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its stiff, triangular stems and dense, spiky inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil. Scirpus schinzianus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
