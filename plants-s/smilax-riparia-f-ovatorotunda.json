    "intro": "Smilax riparia f. ovatorotunda, commonly known as the broad-leaf arrowwood, is a variant of the arrowwood plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often slightly rounded at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its stems are thorny, typical of the Smilacaceae family, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. The foliage is dense, making it a useful plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
