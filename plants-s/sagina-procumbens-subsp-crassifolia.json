    "intro": "Sagina procumbens subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. The flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
