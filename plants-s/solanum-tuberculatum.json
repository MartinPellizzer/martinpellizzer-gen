    "intro": "Solanum tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum tuberculatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
