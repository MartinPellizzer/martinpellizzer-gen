    "intro": "Seticereus icosagonus var. oehmeanus, commonly known as the Oehme's star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny, and often branched stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to dry environments."
