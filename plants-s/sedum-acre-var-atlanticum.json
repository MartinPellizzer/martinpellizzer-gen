    "intro": "Sedum acre var. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to salty, well-drained soils and can tolerate harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping and coastal gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
