    "intro": "Sorghum scoparium, commonly known as silverleaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for marginal lands. Sorghum scoparium is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
