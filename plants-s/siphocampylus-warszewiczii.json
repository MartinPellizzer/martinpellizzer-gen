    "intro": "Siphocampylus warszewiczii, commonly known as the Warszewicz's siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The flowers are small and white, arranged in complex, branched umbels, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
