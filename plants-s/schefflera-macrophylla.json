    "intro": "Schefflera macrophylla, commonly known as the giant umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are attractive to birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera macrophylla is popular as a decorative plant due to its striking foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
