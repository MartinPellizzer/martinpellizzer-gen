    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 borisii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
