    "intro": "Sarcolobus submucronatus, commonly known as the narrow-pointed lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale to dark green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium or green alga, which provides it with nutrients. It is often found on bark and rock surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
