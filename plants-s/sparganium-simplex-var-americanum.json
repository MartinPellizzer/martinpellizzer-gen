    "intro": "Sparganium simplex var. americanum, commonly known as the American bur-reed, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces distinctive, spiky, bur-like structures that are covered in short, stiff hairs. These burs contain small, dark seeds that are dispersed by water or animals. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
