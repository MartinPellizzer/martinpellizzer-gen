    "intro": "Stellaria media subsp. major, commonly known as greater mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. The species is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
