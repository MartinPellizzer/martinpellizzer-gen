    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petaled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, often hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or tundra habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
