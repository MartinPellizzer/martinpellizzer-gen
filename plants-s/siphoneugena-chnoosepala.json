    "intro": "Siphoneugena chnoosepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved siphoneugena, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of the United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
