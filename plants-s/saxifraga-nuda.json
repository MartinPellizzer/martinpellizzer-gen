    "intro": "Saxifraga nuda, commonly known as the naked saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a terminal umbel. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. Saxifraga nuda is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions with minimal water availability."
