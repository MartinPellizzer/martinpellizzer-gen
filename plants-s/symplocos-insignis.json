    "intro": "Symplocos insignis, commonly known as the Indian holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It features elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Symplocos insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
