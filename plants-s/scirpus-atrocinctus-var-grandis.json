    "intro": "Scirpus atrocinctus var. grandis, commonly known as the giant tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, triangular stems and dense clusters of dark brown, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense vegetation in marshes and along the edges of lakes and ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
