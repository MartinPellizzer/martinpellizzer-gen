    "intro": "Strangula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's most striking feature is its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. Strangula flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate, delicate petals that bloom briefly during the rainy season. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely seen in the wild."
