    "intro": "Sorbus mergenthaleriana, commonly known as the Mergenthaler's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species in temperate regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
