    "intro": "Scutellaria saxatilis var. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy skullcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and limestone habitats in Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in wildflower gardens and rocky landscapes."
