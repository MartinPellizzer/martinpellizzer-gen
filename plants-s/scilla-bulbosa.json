    "intro": "Scilla bulbosa, commonly known as the spring squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant's bulb is its primary storage organ, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Scilla bulbosa thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
