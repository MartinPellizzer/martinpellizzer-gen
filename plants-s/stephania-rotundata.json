    "intro": "Stephania rotundata, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular subject in both horticulture and botanical research."
