    "intro": "Styphelia marginata, commonly known as the marginated heath, is a flowering plant native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, leathery leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Styphelia marginata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a humid, cool climate. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for various pollinators."
