    "intro": "Salix flavescens var. scouleriana, commonly known as Scouler's willow, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife. Its ornamental appeal also makes it a popular choice for wetland landscaping."
