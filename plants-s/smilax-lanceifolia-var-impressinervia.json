    "intro": "Smilax lanceifolia var. impressinervia, commonly known as the impressed-veined smilax, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, impressed venation pattern that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
