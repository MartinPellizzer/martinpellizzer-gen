    "intro": "Stevia punctata, commonly known as the spotted stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its small, green leaves with distinctive white or yellow spots. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Stevia punctata is valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a natural sweetener due to its high concentration of steviol glycosides. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for both ornamental and medicinal gardens."
