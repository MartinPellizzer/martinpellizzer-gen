    "intro": "Smilax trinervula, commonly known as the creeping smilax, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often armed with sharp spines, and its compound leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Smilax trinervula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
