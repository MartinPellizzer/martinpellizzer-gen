    "intro": "Stillingia lineata, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrush strokes, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Stillingia lineata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant appearance."
