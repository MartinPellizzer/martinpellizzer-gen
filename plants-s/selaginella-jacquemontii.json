    "intro": "Selaginella jacquemontii, commonly known as the jacquemont's spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often needle-like in appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores. Selaginella jacquemontii is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique adaptations to retain moisture."
