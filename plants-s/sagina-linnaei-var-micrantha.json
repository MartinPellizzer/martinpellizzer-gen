    "intro": "Sagina linnaei var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize sandy or gravelly terrain."
