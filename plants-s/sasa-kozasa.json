    "intro": "Sasa kozasa, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or mountain bamboo, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, China, and Korea, and thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests. The plant forms dense clumps of stiff, hollow stems that can grow up to several meters in height. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-green hue with a fine, hairy texture. Sasa kozasa is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its use in traditional crafts and as a source of edible shoots."
