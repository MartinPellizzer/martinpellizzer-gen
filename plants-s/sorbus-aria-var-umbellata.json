    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. umbellata, commonly known as the white-berried rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white, clustered flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that mature in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in autumn. This species is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
