    "intro": "Salsola kali subsp. ruthenica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is a perennial shrub with succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, bract-laden inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has become an invasive species in many parts of the world. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
