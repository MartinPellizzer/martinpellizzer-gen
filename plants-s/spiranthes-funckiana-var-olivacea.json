    "intro": "Spiranthes funckiana var. olivacea, commonly known as the olive spire orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a subtle fragrance, and they bloom in late summer to early fall. This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and moths."
