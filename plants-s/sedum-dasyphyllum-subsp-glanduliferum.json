It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
