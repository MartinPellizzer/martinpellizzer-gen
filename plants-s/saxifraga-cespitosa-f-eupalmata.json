    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa f. eupalmata, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments. It features dense, low-growing clusters of foliage with thick, waxy leaves that help it survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a compact rosette that helps insulate the plant against cold temperatures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
