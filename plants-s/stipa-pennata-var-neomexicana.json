    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
