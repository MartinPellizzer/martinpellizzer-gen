    "intro": "Swida asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf swida, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its ovate to elliptic leaves, which are typically rough to the touch due to their dense, glandular pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Swida asperifolia thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
