    "intro": "Schoenus subcontortus, commonly known as the twisted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schoenus subcontortus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
