    "intro": "Siphocampylus penduliflorus, commonly known as the hanging flower plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, Siphocampylus penduliflorus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
