    "intro": "Styphelia mutica, commonly known as the hairy whorled greenbulb, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Styphelia mutica is typically found in acidic, sandy soils in coastal dune environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing dune habitats."
