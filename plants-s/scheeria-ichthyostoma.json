    "intro": "Scheeria ichthyostoma, commonly known as the fish-mouth orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often brightly colored flowers that resemble a fish's mouth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Scheeria ichthyostoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
