    "intro": "Salvia flava var. megalantha, commonly known as the giant yellow sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it grows in clusters, often reaching heights of up to 3 feet. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical name reflects its yellow color and the enlarged, showy flowers of the varietal form."
