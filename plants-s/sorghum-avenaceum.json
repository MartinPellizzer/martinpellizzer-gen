    "intro": "Sorghum avenaceum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, dry seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in challenging climates. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control."
