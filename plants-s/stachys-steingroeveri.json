    "intro": "Stachys steingroeveri, commonly known as the Sierra grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often at higher elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stachys steingroeveri is often found in open meadows and is adapted to the harsh climates of its native range."
