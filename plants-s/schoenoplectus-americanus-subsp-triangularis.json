It is characterized by its triangular, ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
