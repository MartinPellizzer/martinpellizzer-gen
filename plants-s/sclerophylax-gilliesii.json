    "intro": "Sclerophylax gilliesii, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray, waxy leaves that are thick and leathery, a trait common in plants adapted to dry climates. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Sclerophylax gilliesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
