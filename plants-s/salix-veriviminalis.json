    "intro": "Salix veriviminalis, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is grayish-white and becomes fissured with age, and it is known for its medicinal properties due to the presence of salicin, a compound similar to aspirin. This species is often found near water sources and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
