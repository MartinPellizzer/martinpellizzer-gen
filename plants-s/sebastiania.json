    "intro": "Sebastiania, commonly known as the sacred tree or paradise tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their ornamental leaves and unique fruit structures. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Sebastiania species produce fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a colorful, fleshy aril. These plants are often cultivated for their aesthetic value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
