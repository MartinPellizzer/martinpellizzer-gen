    "intro": "Saxifraga nivalis var. racemosa, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine, white pubescence that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its ability to withstand cold temperatures and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
