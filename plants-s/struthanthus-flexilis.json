    "intro": "Struthanthus flexilis, commonly known as the flexible struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Loasaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Struthanthus flexilis is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert landscapes."
