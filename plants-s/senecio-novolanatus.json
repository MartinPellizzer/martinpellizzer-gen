    "intro": "Senecio novolanatus, commonly known as the New Zealand Senecio, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal and alpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
