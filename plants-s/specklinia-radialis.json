    "intro": "Specklinia radialis, commonly known as the radiate speckled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds with a distinctive speckled appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. The fronds are bi-lobed and often have a wavy margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
