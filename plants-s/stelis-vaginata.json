    "intro": "Stelis vaginata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture. Stelis vaginata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
