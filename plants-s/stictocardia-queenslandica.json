    "intro": "Stictocardia queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which often has a distinctive, wrinkled appearance. The lichen contains a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the environment. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health."
