    "intro": "Schousboea commutata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Schousboea commutata is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system to access water. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
