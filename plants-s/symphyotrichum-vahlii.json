    "intro": "Symphyotrichum vahlii, commonly known as Vahli's New England aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flower heads that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped, and its flowers are arranged in dense, composite inflorescences. Symphyotrichum vahlii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, during the late summer and early autumn months."
