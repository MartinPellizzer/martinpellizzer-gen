    "intro": "Salix issatissensis, commonly known as the Issatissens willow, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually green or yellowish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
