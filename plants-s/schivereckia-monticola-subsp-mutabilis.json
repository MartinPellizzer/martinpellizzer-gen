    "intro": "Schivereckia monticola subsp. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable schivereckia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous mat. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract various pollinators. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and its role in the ecosystems where it is found. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
