    "intro": "Smeathmannia pubescens var. cordifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed desert wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and pairs of small, oval, pubescent leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
