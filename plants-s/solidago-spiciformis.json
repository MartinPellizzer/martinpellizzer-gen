    "intro": "Solidago spiciformis, commonly known as slender goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are alternate and often covered in fine hairs. Solidago spiciformis plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, during the late summer and early fall."
