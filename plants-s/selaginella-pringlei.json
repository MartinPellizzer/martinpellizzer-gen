    "intro": "Selaginella pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features a dense, mat-like structure with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Selaginella pringlei is known for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in temperate and subtropical regions."
