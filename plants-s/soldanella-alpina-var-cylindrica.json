    "intro": "Soldanella alpina var. cylindrica, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with slender, cylindrical stems and small, alternate leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand harsh climatic conditions."
