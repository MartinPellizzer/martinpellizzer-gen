    "intro": "Salix pyrenaica var. subrotunda, commonly known as the Pyrenean willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its leaves are usually rounded at the base and may have a slightly wavy margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in streamside habitats and alpine meadows."
