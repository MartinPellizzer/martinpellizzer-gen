    "intro": "Schefflera havilandii, commonly known as the Hawaiian schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of palmate leaves, which are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by dark blue berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera havilandii thrives in humid, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its cultivation in both residential and conservation settings."
