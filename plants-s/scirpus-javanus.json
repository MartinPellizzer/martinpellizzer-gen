    "intro": "Scirpus javanus, commonly known as the Java bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread through vegetative propagation. Scirpus javanus thrives in marshy areas and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
