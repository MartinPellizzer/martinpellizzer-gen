    "intro": "Senegalia quadriglandulosa, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, paired leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
