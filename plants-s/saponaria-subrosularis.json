    "intro": "Saponaria subrosularis, commonly known as the pink soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender stems that produce clusters of small, pink or red flowers resembling those of the common soapwort. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is known for its mild saponin content, which can create a soapy lather when crushed. Saponaria subrosularis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
