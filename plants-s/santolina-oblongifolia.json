    "intro": "Santolina oblongifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, upright growth with silvery-gray foliage that is aromatic and slightly fuzzy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its drought-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
