    "intro": "Selaginella delicatula, commonly known as the delicate spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has distinct, spore-bearing structures called strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along streams. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
