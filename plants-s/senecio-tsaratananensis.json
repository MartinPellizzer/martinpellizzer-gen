    "intro": "Senecio tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana groundsel, is an endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, mountainous climate of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
