    "intro": "Sebaea radiata, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red cedar, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is now protected due to overharvesting. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
