    "intro": "Styphelia neurophylla, commonly known as the slender leaf wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are often accompanied by a strong, spicy scent. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Styphelia neurophylla is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
