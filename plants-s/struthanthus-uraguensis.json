    "intro": "Struthanthus uraguensis, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with gray-green foliage adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Struthanthus uraguensis is well-suited to dry climates and requires minimal watering once established."
