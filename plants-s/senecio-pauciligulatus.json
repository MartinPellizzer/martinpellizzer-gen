It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
