    "intro": "Sida setifera, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Sida setifera is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
