    "intro": "Specklinia latilabris, commonly known as the broad-lipped specklinia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and blooms in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
