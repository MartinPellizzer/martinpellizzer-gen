    "intro": "Sicyocarya protrusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sicyocarya, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. Sicyocarya protrusa is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
