    "intro": "Scabiosa pinnata, commonly known as the lace flower or pinnate scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Scabiosa pinnata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
