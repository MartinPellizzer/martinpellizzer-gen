    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata subsp. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and along rocky shores. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it is an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
