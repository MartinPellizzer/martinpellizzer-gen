    "intro": "Stelis salazarii, commonly known as the Salazar's spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thin pseudobulbs and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Stelis salazarii is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
