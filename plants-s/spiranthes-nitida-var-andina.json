    "intro": "Spiranthes nitida var. andina, commonly known as the Andean ladies' tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
