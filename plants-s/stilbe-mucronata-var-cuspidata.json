    "intro": "Stilbe mucronata var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, forming dense clusters at the water's surface. This variety is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips and is valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems."
