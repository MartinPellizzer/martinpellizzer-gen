    "intro": "Silene lepta, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene lepta is an important component of its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
