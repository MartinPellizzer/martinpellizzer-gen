    "intro": "Silene acaulis subsp. exscapa, commonly known as the scented snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its scent is subtle and often described as sweet or slightly medicinal. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude habitats."
