    "intro": "Sporobolus festivus var. stuppeus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown seed heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is drought-tolerant. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with a low, spreading appearance that makes it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use."
