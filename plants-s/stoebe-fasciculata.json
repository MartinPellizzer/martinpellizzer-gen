    "intro": "Stoebe fasciculata, commonly known as narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive, fern-like structure, while its flowers are small and white or greenish in color. Stoebe fasciculata is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
