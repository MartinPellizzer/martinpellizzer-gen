It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic plants."
