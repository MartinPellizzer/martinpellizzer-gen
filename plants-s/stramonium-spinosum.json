    "intro": "Stramonium spinosum, commonly known as thornapple, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive bell-shaped berries. It contains tropane alkaloids, which make it toxic to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity and invasive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
