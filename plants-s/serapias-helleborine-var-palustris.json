    "intro": "Serapias helleborine var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh serapias, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in supporting local pollinators."
