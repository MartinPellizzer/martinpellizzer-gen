    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 patula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and grey, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures."
