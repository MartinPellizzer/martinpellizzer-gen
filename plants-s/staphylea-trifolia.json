    "intro": "Staphylea trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in late summer. Its botanical features include smooth, gray bark and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Staphylea trifolia is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
