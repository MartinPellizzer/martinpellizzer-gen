    "intro": "Senecio glabrifolius, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in dry conditions, while its foliage provides habitat for small insects and animals. Senecio glabrifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
