    "intro": "Stellaria media f. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved common chickweed, is a variant of the common chickweed characterized by its broader, more robust leaves. This subspecies is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. The leaves are typically fleshy and slightly hairy, giving it a distinct appearance compared to the standard form. It produces small white flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along pathways."
