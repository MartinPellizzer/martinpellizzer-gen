    "intro": "Spermacoce longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered bedstraw, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in cymes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Spermacoce longifolia is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
