    "intro": "Sambucus pubescens var. heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of seven ovate to lanceolate leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but are generally toxic when unripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
