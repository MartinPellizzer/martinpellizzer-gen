    "intro": "Sesamum dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's sesame, is a rare and endangered species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, pale brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, adapting to harsh desert conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
