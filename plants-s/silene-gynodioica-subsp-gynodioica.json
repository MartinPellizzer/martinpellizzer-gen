    "intro": "Silene gynodioica subsp. gynodioica, commonly known as the female-flowered catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same individual, though the female flowers are more prominent. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
