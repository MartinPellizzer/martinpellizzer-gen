    "intro": "Saxifraga lutea, commonly known as the yellow saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga lutea is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
