    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 tsugaluensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hybrid willow, is a cultivar of willow that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is a hybrid between Salix \u00d7 tsugata and Salix lanata, resulting in a plant with broad, flat leaves that differ from the typical narrow leaves of most willow species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with a dense, rounded form. Its leaves are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
