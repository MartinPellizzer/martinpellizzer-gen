    "intro": "Sorbus astateria, commonly known as the alpine whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape and often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red or orange berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
