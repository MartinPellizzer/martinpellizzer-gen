    "intro": "Satyrium aberrans, commonly known as the pale marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along riverbanks. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves and a single, showy, pale pink or white flower. Its morphology is adapted to its wetland environment, with specialized root systems for nutrient uptake in waterlogged conditions. The species is considered rare and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological specificity and conservation status."
