    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 alaica, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa robusta. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making it a common ornamental and forage plant in agricultural settings."
