    "intro": "Schoenoplectus maritimus, commonly known as saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Schoenoplectus maritimus plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland species."
