    "intro": "Sonchus tenerrimus subsp. halodianae, commonly known as the coastal sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and lobed, serrated leaves that are adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
