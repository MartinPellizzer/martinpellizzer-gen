    "intro": "Solanum andigenum subsp. argentinicum, commonly known as the Argentine nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that mature to a dark purple or black color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
