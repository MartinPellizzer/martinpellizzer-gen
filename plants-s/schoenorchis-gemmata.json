    "intro": "Schoenorchis gemmata, commonly known as the gemmated orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it can receive filtered sunlight. Its unique reproductive strategy involves the formation of gemmae, which are small vegetative propagules that can develop into new plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schoenorchis gemmata is considered a conservation concern."
