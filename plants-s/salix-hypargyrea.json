    "intro": "Salix hypargyrea, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
