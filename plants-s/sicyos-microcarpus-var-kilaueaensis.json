    "intro": "Sicyos microcarpus var. kilaueaensis, commonly known as the Kilauea prickly pear, is a cactus-like plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often found on the island of Hawaii. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits that are used in traditional Hawaiian cuisine. This variety is notable for its adaptability to volcanic soils and its role in the local ecosystem."
