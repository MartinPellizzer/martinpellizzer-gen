    "intro": "Schinus huigan var. ovata, commonly known as the Chilean pepper tree or huilliche pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, red berries. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The fruit, while edible, contains toxic compounds and should be consumed with caution."
