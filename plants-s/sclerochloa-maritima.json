    "intro": "Sclerochloa maritima, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain tiny flowers typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its resilience to harsh maritime conditions makes it a valuable plant for dune stabilization and ecological restoration."
