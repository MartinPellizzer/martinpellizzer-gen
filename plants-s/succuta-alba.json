    "intro": "Succuta alba, commonly known as white purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and the stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread easily. Succuta alba is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant and adaptable to various environmental conditions."
