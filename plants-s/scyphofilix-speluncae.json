    "intro": "Scyphofilix speluncae, commonly known as the cave scyphofilix, is a rare and specialized plant found in subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid cave systems where it relies on limited light sources such as bioluminescent fungi for photosynthesis. Its leaves are adapted to low-light conditions, featuring a thick, waxy cuticle to retain moisture. The plant's root system is highly developed to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich cave floor. Due to its unique habitat, Scyphofilix speluncae is considered an indicator species for cave ecosystems."
