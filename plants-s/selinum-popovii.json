It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white, umbel-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine. Selinum popovii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
