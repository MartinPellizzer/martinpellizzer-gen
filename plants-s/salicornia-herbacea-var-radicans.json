    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. radicans, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and branches that are often red or pink in color, and it produces small, green flowers. It is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion."
