    "intro": "Sempervivum hirsutum, commonly known as the hirsute houseleek, is a species of succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. Sempervivum hirsutum is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
