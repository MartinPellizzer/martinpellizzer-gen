    "intro": "Scleria sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on long, slender panicles. Scleria sylvestris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible roots, which have a starchy texture similar to arrowroot."
