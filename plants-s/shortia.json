It consists of a single species, Shortia galacifolia, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Shortia is also notable for its unique reproductive structures, which include a specialized flower arrangement that aids in pollination."
