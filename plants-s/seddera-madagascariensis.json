    "intro": "Seddera madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar seddera, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
