    "intro": "Saxifraga candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick saxifraga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and its striking inflorescence of small, white to pink flowers that resemble a candlestick. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it forms dense mats. Saxifraga candelabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
