    "intro": "Styrax tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Mexican tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to the humid lowlands of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Styracaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules that contain aromatic seeds. Its bark is thick and flaky, often exuding a resinous substance when wounded. Styrax tuxtlensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
