    "intro": "Senegalia ochracea, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Senegalia ochracea is drought-tolerant and adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a common species in desert ecosystems. It plays a role in preventing soil erosion and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
