    "intro": "Statice glauca, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Statice glauca is often used in ornamental gardening and is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils along shorelines."
