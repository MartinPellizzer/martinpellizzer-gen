    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. minutum, commonly known as the miniature houseleek, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the Alps. It features dense clusters of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, forming rosettes close to the ground. The plant is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats, making it suitable for rock gardens and container planting."
