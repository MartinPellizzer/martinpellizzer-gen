    "intro": "Stilago bunius, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, while the plant is adapted to withstand harsh maritime environments. Stilago bunius is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
