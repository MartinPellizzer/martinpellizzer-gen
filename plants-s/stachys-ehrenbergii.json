    "intro": "Stachys ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert betony, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with erect, hairy stems that produce clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It blooms primarily in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stachys ehrenbergii is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
