    "intro": "Sesuvium edule, commonly known as edible sandplant, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline and coastal environments. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale flowers that are typically inconspicuous, and it has a sprawling growth habit with branched stems. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Sesuvium edule is native to regions such as southern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
