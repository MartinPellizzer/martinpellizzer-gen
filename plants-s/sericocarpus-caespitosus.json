    "intro": "Sericocarpus caespitosus, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, bristly pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Sericocarpus caespitosus typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils."
