    "intro": "Scirpus membranaceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Scirpus membranaceus is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the banks of slow-moving streams."
