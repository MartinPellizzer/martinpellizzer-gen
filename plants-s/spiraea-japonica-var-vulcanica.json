It is characterized by its cascading clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a weeping appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
