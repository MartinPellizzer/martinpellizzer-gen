It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
