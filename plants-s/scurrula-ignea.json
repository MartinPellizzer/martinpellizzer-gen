    "intro": "Scurrula ignea, commonly known as the flame lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a striking orange to reddish-orange coloration. It is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to photosynthesize and thrive in various environments. The plant typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil, and is often found in temperate and tropical regions. Its thallus is leathery and flat, with a distinct margin that may curl or remain straight. Scurrula ignea is known for its resilience to environmental stress and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality."
