    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis f. rebunshirensis, commonly known as the Rebunshiro saxifrage, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily on the island of Rebun in the Shikotan Islands, Japan. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
