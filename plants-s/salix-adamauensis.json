    "intro": "Salix adamauensis, commonly known as the Adamaua willow, is a shrub native to the highlands of East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
