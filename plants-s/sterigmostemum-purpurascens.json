It possesses a distinctive appearance with its woody, often purple-tinged stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries. Botanically, it belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its specialized root system that attaches to the host plant for nutrient uptake."
