    "intro": "Scrophularia rodinii, commonly known as the Persian fig or red root, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Scrophularia rodinii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
