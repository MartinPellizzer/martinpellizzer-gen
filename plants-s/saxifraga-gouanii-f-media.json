    "intro": "Saxifraga gouanii f. media, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
