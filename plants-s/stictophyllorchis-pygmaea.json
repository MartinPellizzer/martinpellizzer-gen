    "intro": "Stictophyllorchis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, rhizomatous stem with a few narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually pale green or yellowish, and are borne in clusters. Due to its delicate nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
