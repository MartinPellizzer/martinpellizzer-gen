    "intro": "Stapelia cooperi, commonly known as the cooper's stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators like beetles. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for collectors. Stapelia cooperi is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
