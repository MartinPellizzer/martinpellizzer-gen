    "intro": "Stevensonia sechallara, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Stevensonia sechallara plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly moths and beetles, due to its nocturnal flowering habit."
