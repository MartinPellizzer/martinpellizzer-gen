    "intro": "Stenocereus martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white or yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and has a slow growth rate."
