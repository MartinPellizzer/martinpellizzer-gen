    "intro": "Sedum himalayanum, commonly known as the Himalayan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on cliffs, gravelly soils, and in alpine meadows. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
