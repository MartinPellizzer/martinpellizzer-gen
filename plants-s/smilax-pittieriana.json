    "intro": "Smilax pittieriana, commonly known as the Trinidad arrowroot, is a climbing shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils that help it climb and anchor to supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, waxy texture. Smilax pittieriana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
