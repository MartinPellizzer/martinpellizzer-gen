    "intro": "Sida arborea, commonly known as the tree sida, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sida arborea is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate saline conditions, making it a hardy species. Its fibrous roots and dense foliage make it useful for erosion control in certain environments."
