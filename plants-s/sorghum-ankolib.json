    "intro": "Sorghum ankolib, commonly known as millet, is a type of grass native to Africa and widely cultivated for its grains. It is a C4 plant, meaning it efficiently performs photosynthesis in hot and dry climates, making it drought-resistant. The plant produces small, hard grains that are rich in carbohydrates and proteins. It has a short growing season and is often grown as a staple food crop in arid regions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a tall, branched stem that supports its grain heads."
