    "intro": "Stillingia integerrima, commonly known as the Chinese teaberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but are used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Stillingia integerrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal significance."
