It is characterized by its narrow, flat blades and upright growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically brown or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or prairies. Setaria flabelliformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
