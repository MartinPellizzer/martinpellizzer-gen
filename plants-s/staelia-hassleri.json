    "intro": "Staelia hassleri, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Staelia hassleri is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
