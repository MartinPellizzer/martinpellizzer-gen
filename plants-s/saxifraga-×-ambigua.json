    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 ambigua, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga cespitosa, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, harsh environments. It produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually rosette-shaped with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Saxifraga \u00d7 ambigua is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
