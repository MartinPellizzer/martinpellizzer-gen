    "intro": "Selaginella bracei, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, linear leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. Selaginella bracei is characterized by its sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores, a feature typical of many clubmosses. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
