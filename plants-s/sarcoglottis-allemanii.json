It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices. The plant produces berries that are yellow when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.
