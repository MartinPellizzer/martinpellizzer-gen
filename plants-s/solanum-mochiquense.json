    "intro": "Solanum mochiquense, commonly known as the Mochique nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, and they contain toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other solanum species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
