    "intro": "Salvia rouyana var. dentatiformis, commonly known as the serrated-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. The plant produces striking violet to purple flower clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
