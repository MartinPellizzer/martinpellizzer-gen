    "intro": "Symphyotrichum dumosum var. subulifolium, commonly known as the dwarf heath aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the fall. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a pointed tip, and are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and dunes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators in late summer and autumn."
