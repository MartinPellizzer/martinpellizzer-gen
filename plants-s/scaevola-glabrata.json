    "intro": "Scaevola glabrata, commonly known as the common fanflower, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Australia. It features small, brightly colored flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters that resemble fans. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Scaevola glabrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
