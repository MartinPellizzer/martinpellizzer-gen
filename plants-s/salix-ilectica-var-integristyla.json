    "intro": "Salix ilectica var. integristyla, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. Due to its cold-hardiness and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing fragile Arctic ecosystems."
