    "intro": "Sarcochilus violaceus, commonly known as the violet lady's mantle, is a striking orchid native to New Zealand. It features a unique, waxy, violet-hued leaf rosette that resembles a shield, providing protection to its flower spikes. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
