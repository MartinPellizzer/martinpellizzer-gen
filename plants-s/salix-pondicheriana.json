    "intro": "Salix pondicheriana, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy surface, and they turn a striking golden-yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
