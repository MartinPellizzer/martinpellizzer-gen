It is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland areas and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Sentis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
