    "intro": "Striga eustriga, commonly known as the dwarf witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests the roots of grasses, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant agricultural damage. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a major weed in cereal crops such as maize and sorghum. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals."
