    "intro": "Sempervivum schottii, commonly known as the Schott's houseleek, is a hardy succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in colder conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum schottii is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
