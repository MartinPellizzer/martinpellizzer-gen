    "intro": "Styphelia intertexta, commonly known as the pink snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a drought-resistant feature. Styphelia intertexta is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
