    "intro": "Stackhousia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered stackhousea, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in winter, often in clusters at the ends of the branches. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Stackhousia uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fragrant foliage and delicate blooms."
