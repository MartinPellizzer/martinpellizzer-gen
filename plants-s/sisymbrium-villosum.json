    "intro": "Sisymbrium villosum, commonly known as hairy shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, characterized by its branched stems and alternate leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by distinctive triangular seed pods. Its botanical name reflects its hairy appearance, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Sisymbrium villosum is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
