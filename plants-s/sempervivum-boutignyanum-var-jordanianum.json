    "intro": "Sempervivum boutignyanum var. jordanianum, commonly known as the Jordanian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
