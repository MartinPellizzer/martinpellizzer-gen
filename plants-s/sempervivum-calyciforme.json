    "intro": "Sempervivum calyciforme, commonly known as the silver carpet sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, fleshy leaves that form a rosette pattern, often covered in a fine layer of white wax that gives it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ease of care."
