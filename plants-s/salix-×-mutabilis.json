    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 mutabilis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading foliage, with long, slender leaves that hang in drooping clusters. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The weeping willow also has a shallow root system, which can make it susceptible to damage from construction or flooding."
