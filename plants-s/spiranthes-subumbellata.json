    "intro": "Spiranthes subumbellata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to North America. It is a perennial herb that grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces a dense, spiraling inflorescence of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in native plant gardens."
