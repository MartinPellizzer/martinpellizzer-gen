    "intro": "Sorbus chamaemespilus f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeams, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are narrow and often slightly serrated. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by small, orange-red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. This form is notable for its distinct foliage and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
