    "intro": "Sedum litoreum subsp. praesidis, commonly known as the coastal stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in maritime environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-resistant and suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes."
