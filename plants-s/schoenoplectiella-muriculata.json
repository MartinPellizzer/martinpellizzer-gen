    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella muriculata, commonly known as the prickly bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, while its seeds are dispersed by water. Schoenoplectiella muriculata is also valued for its ability to filter pollutants from water."
