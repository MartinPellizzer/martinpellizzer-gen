It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces unique flowers that are often described as resembling dead animals, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually small and pointed, and it blooms in shades of yellow and orange. Stapelia parvipuncta is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
