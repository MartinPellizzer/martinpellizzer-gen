    "intro": "Stenocarpus forsteri, commonly known as the mountain bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bottle-shaped inflorescences that are typically red or pink in color. The plant produces small, dense clusters of flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture. Stenocarpus forsteri is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
