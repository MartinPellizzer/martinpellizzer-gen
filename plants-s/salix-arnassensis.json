    "intro": "Salix arnassensis, commonly known as the Arnassan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix arnassensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and boreal forest edges. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various Arctic wildlife species."
