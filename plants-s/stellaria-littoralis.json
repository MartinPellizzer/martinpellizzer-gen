    "intro": "Stellaria littoralis, commonly known as sea starwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. The plant has small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, and its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Stellaria littoralis is often found in maritime environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions."
