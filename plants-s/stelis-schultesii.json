    "intro": "Stelis schultesii, commonly known as the Schultes' orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Stelis schultesii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
