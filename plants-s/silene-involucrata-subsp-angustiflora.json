It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is native to parts of North America and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
