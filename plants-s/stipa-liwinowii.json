    "intro": "Stipa liwinowii, commonly known as the Liwinow's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a grayish-green hue that helps it conserve moisture. Stipa liwinowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
