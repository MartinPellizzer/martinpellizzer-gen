    "intro": "Sophora alopecuroides, commonly known as Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain flattened, winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts used in traditional Chinese medicine."
