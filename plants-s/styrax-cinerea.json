    "intro": "Styrax cinerea, commonly known as the gray styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pale gray bark and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated edge. Styrax cinerea is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
