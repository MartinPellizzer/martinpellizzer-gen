    "intro": "Selaginella laevigata var. lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features spirally arranged, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. This variety is notable for its morphological similarity to other Selaginella species, making it a subject of taxonomic interest."
