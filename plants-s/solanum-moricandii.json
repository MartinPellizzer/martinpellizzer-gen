    "intro": "Solanum moricandii, commonly known as the Moricandii nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Solanum moricandii is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, making it a resilient species in challenging climates."
