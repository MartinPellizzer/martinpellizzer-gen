    "intro": "Sprengeria minuscula, commonly known as the small flame orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, vividly colored flowers that are typically orange-red or yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the understorey of dense vegetation. Its flowers are short-lived but attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
