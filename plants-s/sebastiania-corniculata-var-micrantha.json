The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are a striking feature of the species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form, attractive foliage, and seasonal color changes."
