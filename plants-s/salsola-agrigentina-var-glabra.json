    "intro": "Salsola agrigentina var. glabra, commonly known as smooth Russian thorn, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its glabrous (hairless) stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically dispersed by wind. It is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline soils across the Mediterranean region. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
