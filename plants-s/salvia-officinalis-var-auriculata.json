    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salvia officinalus var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate sage, is a variant of the common sage plant. It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves, which give it a unique appearance. This plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. While it shares many traits with the common sage, its ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for gardens and herbal collections."
