    "intro": "Simbuleta hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy simbuleta, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its foliage is often covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
