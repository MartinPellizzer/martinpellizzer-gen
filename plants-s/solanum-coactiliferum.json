    "intro": "Solanum coactiliferum, commonly known as the red devil tree, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers and toxic berries. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain poisonous compounds, making it a potential hazard to livestock and humans. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in agricultural settings but studied for its ecological and chemical properties."
