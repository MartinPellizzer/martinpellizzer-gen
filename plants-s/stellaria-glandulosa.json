    "intro": "Stellaria glandulosa, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and also covered in soft, glandular hairs. Stellaria glandulosa thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
