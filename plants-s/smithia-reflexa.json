    "intro": "Smithia reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed smilacine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Smilacaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and slender, vine-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Smithia reflexa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along streambanks."
