    "intro": "Selaginella fergusonii, commonly known as the Ferguson's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with whorled leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly curled or twisted appearance. Selaginella fergusonii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
