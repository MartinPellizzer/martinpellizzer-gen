    "intro": "Sorghum pusillum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, pale green or brown flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging climates. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover crop."
