    "intro": "Strychnos carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's bitter apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are rich in alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, contributing to its survival in its natural habitat. Its ornamental value and medicinal potential have led to interest in its cultivation and study."
