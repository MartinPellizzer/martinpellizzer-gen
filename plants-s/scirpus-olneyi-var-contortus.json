    "intro": "Scirpus olneyi var. contortus, commonly known as the twisted bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often exhibit a twisted or spiraled growth pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
