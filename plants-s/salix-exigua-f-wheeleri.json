It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery-white underside that adds to its visual appeal. This form is typically found in wetland environments, where it thrives in moist soil conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
