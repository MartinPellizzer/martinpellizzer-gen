It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Schauera is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest understories. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive foliage."
