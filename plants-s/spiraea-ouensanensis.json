    "intro": "Spiraea ouensanensis, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features arching stems covered in small, oval leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, wetlands, and along stream banks. Spiraea ouensanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
