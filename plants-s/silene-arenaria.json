    "intro": "Silene arenaria, commonly known as the sand catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal scrub. Silene arenaria is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitats."
