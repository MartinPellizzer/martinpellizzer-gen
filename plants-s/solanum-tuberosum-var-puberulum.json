    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves. This variety is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its tubers are generally smaller than those of the standard potato, with a slightly different texture and flavor profile. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares many genetic traits with other Solanum species. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant adaptation and genetic diversity."
