It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Its foliage consists of thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. Sanamunda is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom continuously under proper care."
