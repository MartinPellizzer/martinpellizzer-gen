It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow or orange flowers, which are typically tubular in shape. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal.
