    "intro": "Soda longifolia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Soda longifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
