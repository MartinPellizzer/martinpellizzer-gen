    "intro": "Struthiopteris struthiopteris, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a perennial fern that belongs to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called strobili, are typically found at the top of the stem. Struthiopteris struthiopteris is an ancient plant species that has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years."
