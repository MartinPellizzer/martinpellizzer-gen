It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with smooth margins and a dark green upper surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
