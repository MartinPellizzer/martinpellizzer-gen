It typically grows in grassy areas and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
