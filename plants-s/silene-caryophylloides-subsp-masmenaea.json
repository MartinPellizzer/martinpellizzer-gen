    "intro": "Silene caryophylloides subsp. masmenaea, commonly known as the mountain flax or silene of the mountains, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
