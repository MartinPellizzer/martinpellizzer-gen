    "intro": "Salix humilis var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically male and female, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
