    "intro": "Solanum dunalianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are followed by berries that mature to a yellow or orange color. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for human consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
