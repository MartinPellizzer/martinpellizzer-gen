    "intro": "Selliguea elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has small, spirally arranged leaves that are usually green to reddish in color, depending on environmental conditions. It reproduces via spores, which are released from capsules that develop on specialized structures called setae. Selliguea elmeri is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
