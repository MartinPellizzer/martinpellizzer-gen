    "intro": "Sloanea jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's sloanea, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of western Colombia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with distinctive cyathium structures. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Sloanea jaramilloi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
