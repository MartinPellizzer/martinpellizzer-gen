    "intro": "Sageretia, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species native to Asia, particularly China, where they are often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Sageretia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with some varieties being used in traditional medicine. Their ability to fix nitrogen makes them ecologically important in soil enrichment and land restoration."
