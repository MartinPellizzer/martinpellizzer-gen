    "intro": "Streptopus streptopoides var. streptopoides, commonly known as the fairy slipper, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
