    "intro": "Sabia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sabia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically large, broad, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Sabia tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in the humid climate."
