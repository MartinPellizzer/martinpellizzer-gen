    "intro": "Selago gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Selago gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and arthropods in its native habitats."
