    "intro": "Sipanea coppenamensis, commonly known as the Coppenamens Island lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found in specific tropical regions. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its growth is closely associated with particular substrates, such as bark or rock surfaces, and it plays a role in ecological succession in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments."
