    "intro": "Selaginella striata, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique form of spore reproduction, with spores produced in specialized structures called strobila. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a zigzag pattern, which gives it its common name. Selaginella striata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
