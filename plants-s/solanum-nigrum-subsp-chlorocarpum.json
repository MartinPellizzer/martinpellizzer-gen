    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subsp. chlorocarpum, commonly known as the green-fruited nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into green, fleshy berries, which turn red when mature. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas."
