    "intro": "Styphelia spicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring and early summer. Styphelia spicata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
