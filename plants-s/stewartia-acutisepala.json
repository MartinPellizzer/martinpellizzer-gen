    "intro": "Stewartia acutisepala, commonly known as the sharp-sepaled stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its ornamental, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, followed by cup-shaped, red-brown fruits. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. Stewartia acutisepala is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions and its relatively slow growth rate."
