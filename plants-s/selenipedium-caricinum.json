    "intro": "Selenipedium caricinum, commonly known as the giant panicle orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach several meters in height, composed of numerous fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique structure includes a thick, fleshy rhizome and long, strap-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Selenipedium caricinum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
