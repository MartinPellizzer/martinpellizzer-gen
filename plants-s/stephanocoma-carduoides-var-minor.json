    "intro": "Stephanocoma carduoides var. minor, commonly known as the small burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is shrub-like, with narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
