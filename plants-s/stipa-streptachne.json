    "intro": "Stipa streptachne, commonly known as the narrowleaf wiregrass, is a grass species native to parts of Africa, including South Africa. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Stipa streptachne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
