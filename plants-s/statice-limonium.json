    "intro": "Statice limonium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its flowers are typically tubular and bloom in late summer to early autumn. Statice limonium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
