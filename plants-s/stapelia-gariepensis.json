    "intro": "Stapelia gariepensis, commonly known as the Cape Town carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, meaty-looking flowers that emit a strong odor resembling decaying flesh, a trait that attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically green and cylindrical, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Stapelia gariepensis is often cultivated for its unique appearance and adaptability to dry climates."
