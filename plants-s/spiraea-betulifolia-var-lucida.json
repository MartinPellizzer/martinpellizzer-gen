    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia var. lucida, commonly known as shining willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth, glossy surface that reflects light, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
