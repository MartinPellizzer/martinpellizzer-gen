    "intro": "Sloanea austroqueenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland sloanea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has smooth, grey to brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a leathery texture and prominent veins. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Sloanea austroqueenslandica is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native rainforest habitat."
