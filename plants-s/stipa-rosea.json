    "intro": "Stipa rosea, commonly known as the rose grass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fluffy, pinkish-red inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more intense in the summer months. Stipa rosea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance."
