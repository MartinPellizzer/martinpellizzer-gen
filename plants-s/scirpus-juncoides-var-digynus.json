    "intro": "Scirpus juncoides var. digynus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in saturated soils. The plant has tall, slender, cylindrical stems that are usually green to reddish in color. Its flowering spikes are usually unisexual, with separate male and female flowers, which is a characteristic feature of this variety. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help stabilize the soil in wetland environments."
