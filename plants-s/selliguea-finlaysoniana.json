    "intro": "Selliguea finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dense, cushion-like growths composed of closely packed, green to reddish-brown leaf-like structures. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having specialized structures called thallus for absorption and anchorage. Selliguea finlaysoniana plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
