    "intro": "Senegalia miersii, commonly known as the Miers' acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils. Senegalia miersii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
