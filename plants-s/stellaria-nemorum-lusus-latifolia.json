    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum lusus latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It typically features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, star-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist environments. It thrives in shaded, damp habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. This plant is often found in the understorey of forests, where it contributes to the ground layer vegetation."
