    "intro": "Saxifraga canescens, commonly known as the hoary saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Saxifraga canescens is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
