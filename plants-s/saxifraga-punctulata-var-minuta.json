    "intro": "Saxifraga punctulata var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of white or pale woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are often borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
