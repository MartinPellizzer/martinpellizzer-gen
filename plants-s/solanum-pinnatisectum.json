    "intro": "Solanum pinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its finely pinnatisected leaves, which give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark purple or black color, containing toxic alkaloids. Solanum pinnatisectum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
