    "intro": "Stellaria media subsp. umbrosa, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its rosette of small, rounded leaves. It produces tiny white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores."
