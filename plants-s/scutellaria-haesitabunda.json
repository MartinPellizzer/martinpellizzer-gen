    "intro": "Scutellaria haesitabunda, commonly known as the hesitating skullcup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
