    "intro": "Scorzonera pumila, commonly known as the dwarf scorzonera, is a small, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clustered, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round tubers underground, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Scorzonera pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
