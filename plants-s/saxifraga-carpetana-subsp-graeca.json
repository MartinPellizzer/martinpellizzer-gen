    "intro": "Saxifraga carpetana subsp. graeca, commonly known as the Greek saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece and the Balkans. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, hardy ground covers in alpine gardens."
