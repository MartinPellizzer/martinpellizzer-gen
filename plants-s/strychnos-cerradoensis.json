    "intro": "Strychnos cerradoensis, commonly known as the cerrado strychnos, is a shrub native to the Brazilian Cerrado biome. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for livestock and wildlife. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for certain insect species, though its toxicity limits its use in traditional medicine."
