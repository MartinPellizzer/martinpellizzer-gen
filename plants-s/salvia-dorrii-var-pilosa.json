It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia dorrii var. pilosa is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
