    "intro": "Salix purpurea f. styligera, commonly known as the purple willow with clustered flowers, is a botanical variant of the purple willow. It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences and distinctive purple-tinged foliage. This form is typically found in moist, temperate environments, often near water bodies. The plant exhibits dioecious flowering, with separate male and female plants. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in willow taxonomy and ecological adaptation."
