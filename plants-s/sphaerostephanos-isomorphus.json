    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos isomorphus, commonly known as the smooth-stephanos, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant features small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly lobed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
