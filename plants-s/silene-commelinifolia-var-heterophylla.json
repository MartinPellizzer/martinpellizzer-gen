    "intro": "Silene commelinifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf bladdercamp, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves vary in shape and size, which is reflected in its varietal name \"heterophylla,\" meaning \"different leaves.\" The species is also notable for its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer."
