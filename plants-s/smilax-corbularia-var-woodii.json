    "intro": "Smilax corbularia var. woodii, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, trifoliate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps and forests, and is often found in the understory of hardwood forests. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
