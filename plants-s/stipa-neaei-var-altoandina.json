    "intro": "Stipa neaei var. altoandina, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
