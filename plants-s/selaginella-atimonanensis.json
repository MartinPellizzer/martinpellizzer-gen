    "intro": "Selaginella atimonanensis, commonly known as the Atimonan spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in strobila, which are cone-like structures. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
