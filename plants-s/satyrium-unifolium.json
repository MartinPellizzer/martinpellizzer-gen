    "intro": "Satyrium unifolium, commonly known as the single-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its single, lance-shaped leaf and a single, erect flower spike bearing a single, showy orchid flower. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it is often found in nutrient-poor soils."
