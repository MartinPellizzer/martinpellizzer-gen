    "intro": "Smithorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Smithorchis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
