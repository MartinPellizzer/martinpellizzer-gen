    "intro": "Solidago mollis, commonly known as smooth goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to dry soils in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. Smooth goldenrod is a valuable plant for pollinators, providing nectar-rich blooms throughout the summer."
