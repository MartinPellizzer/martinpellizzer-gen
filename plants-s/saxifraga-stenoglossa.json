    "intro": "Saxifraga stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga stenoglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand cold and arid climates."
