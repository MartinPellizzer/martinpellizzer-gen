    "intro": "Saxifraga corsica var. fontqueri, commonly known as the Corsican saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
