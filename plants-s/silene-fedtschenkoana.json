    "intro": "Silene fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's campion, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the short summer season. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
