It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and sandy soils. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
