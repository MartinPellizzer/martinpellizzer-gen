    "intro": "Solanum prolatum, commonly known as the purple potato vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant purple foliage. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that give way to berry-like fruits containing toxic seeds. Its tuberous roots are similar to potatoes but are not typically consumed due to their bitter taste and potential toxicity. Solanum prolatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
