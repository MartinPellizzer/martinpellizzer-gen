    "intro": "Sterculia speciosa, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a large, fast-growing tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it its common name. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is often planted for its ornamental value and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in various soil types. The plant is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture making."
