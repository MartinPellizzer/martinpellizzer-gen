It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads. The plant has a creeping, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Senecio ficoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
