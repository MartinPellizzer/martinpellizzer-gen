    "intro": "Salix longiflora var. albescens, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and is known for its early spring blooming habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
