    "intro": "Sphenostigma geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, undulating thallus structure. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant's body is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic relationship. Its morphology includes a leathery, lobed appearance with a yellowish to greenish hue. Sphenostigma geniculatum plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
