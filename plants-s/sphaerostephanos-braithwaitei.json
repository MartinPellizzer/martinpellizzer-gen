    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos braithwaitei, commonly known as the Braithwaite's starry bell, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a prominent central boss. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a gelatinous coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
