    "intro": "Solanum vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
