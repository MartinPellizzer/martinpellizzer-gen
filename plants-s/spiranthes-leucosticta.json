It is characterized by its delicate, spiraled inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are small and white with greenish markings, and it blooms from late summer to early fall. The species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
