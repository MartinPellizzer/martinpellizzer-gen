    "intro": "Salix ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanensis willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. This species is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential use in phytoremediation."
