    "intro": "Sticherus axialis, commonly known as the axillary sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the axils of its leaves. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. The species is valued in ecological studies for its role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of undisturbed habitats."
