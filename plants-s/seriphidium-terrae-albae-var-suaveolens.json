    "intro": "Seriphidium terrae-albae var. suaveolens, commonly known as the white soil wormwood, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its branched, aromatic stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
