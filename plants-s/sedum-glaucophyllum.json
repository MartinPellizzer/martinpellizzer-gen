It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
