    "intro": "Sphaeralcea grossulariifolia subsp. pedata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. Its subspecies status reflects slight morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
