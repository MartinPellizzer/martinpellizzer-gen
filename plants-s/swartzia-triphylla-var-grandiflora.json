    "intro": "Swartzia triphylla var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody pods containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
