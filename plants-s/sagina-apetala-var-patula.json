    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. patula, commonly known as moss campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its succulent texture. Native to arctic and alpine regions, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This plant is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
