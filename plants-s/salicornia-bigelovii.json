    "intro": "Salicornia bigelovii, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is widely distributed along coastal areas and salt marshes in North America. Salicornia bigelovii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
