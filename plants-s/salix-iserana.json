    "intro": "Salix iserana, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Salix iserana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
