    "intro": "Strychnos cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate to cordate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
