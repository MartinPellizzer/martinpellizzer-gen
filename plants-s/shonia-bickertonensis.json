    "intro": "Shonia bickertonensis, commonly known as the Bickerton's shonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
