    "intro": "Sticherus interjectus, commonly known as the slender sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences, which are often borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is commonly found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
