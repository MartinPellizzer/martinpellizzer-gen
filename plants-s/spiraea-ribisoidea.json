    "intro": "Spiraea ribisoidea, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, arching branches covered in small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in corymbs. Its foliage turns a striking golden yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. Spiraea ribisoidea prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
