    "intro": "Simocheilus multiflorus, commonly known as the multibloom fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emerge from a central rhizome. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which appear during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
