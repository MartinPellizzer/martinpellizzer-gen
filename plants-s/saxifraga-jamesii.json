    "intro": "Saxifraga jamesii, commonly known as the James's saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in a dense inflorescence at the stem's apex. Saxifraga jamesii is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
