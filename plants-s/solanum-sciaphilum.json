    "intro": "Solanum sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade-loving nightshade, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a deep red. It is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and unique growth habits, it is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
