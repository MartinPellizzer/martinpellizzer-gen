    "intro": "Scirpus carinatus, commonly known as the ridge sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Scirpus carinatus produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of wetland communities."
