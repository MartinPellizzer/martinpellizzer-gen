    "intro": "Saxifraga brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Saxifraga brachypoda is well adapted to its environment, with a compact growth form that minimizes exposure to wind and frost."
