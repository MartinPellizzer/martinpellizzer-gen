It typically grows in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that are clustered at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Scirpus jaluanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
