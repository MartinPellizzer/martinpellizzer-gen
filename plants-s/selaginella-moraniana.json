    "intro": "Selaginella moraniana, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters, typically growing in humid, shaded environments. This plant is native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Selaginella moraniana reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate low light conditions."
