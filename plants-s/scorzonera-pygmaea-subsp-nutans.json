It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a tuberous root system, which is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
