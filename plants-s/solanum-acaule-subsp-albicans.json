It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
