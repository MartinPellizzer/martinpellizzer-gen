    "intro": "Silphium trifoliatum f. praecisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a head-like inflorescence. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its historical significance includes use by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes."
