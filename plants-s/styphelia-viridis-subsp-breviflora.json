    "intro": "Styphelia viridis subsp. breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered green heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
