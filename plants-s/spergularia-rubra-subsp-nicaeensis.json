    "intro": "Spergularia rubra subsp. nicaeensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, pink or red flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. This subspecies is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It has a low-growing habit and produces capsule fruits that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is well adapted to harsh, saline conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
