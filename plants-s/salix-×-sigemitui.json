    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sigemitui, commonly known as the Sierra willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
