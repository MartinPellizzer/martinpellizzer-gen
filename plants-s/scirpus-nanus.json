    "intro": "Scirpus nanus, commonly known as dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of brownish flowers that appear in late summer. Scirpus nanus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
