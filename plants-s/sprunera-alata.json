    "intro": "Sprunera alata, commonly known as the winged sprout, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered with small, wing-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Sprunera alata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
