It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and striking, often variegated foliage. The plant has compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
