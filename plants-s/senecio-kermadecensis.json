    "intro": "Senecio kermadecensis, commonly known as the Kermadec groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its island habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio kermadecensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
