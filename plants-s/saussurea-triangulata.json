    "intro": "Saussurea triangulata, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, pale yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across high-altitude regions. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often covered with dense, white hairs. Saussurea triangulata is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
