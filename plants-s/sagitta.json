    "intro": "Sagitta, commonly known as the arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to various regions of the Americas. It belongs to the genus Sagittaria, which includes several species with similar aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the mud. Sagittaria species often thrive in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. These plants are not only ecologically important for supporting aquatic life but also have historical uses in traditional medicine."
