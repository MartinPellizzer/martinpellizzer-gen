    "intro": "Spergula nodosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. Its distinctive characteristic is the presence of glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its scientific name. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
