    "intro": "Scleranthus paganus, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its rough, ribbed stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are often mistaken for burrs. Its seeds are encased in spiny, persistent husks that aid in seed dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing. Scleranthus paganus thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands."
