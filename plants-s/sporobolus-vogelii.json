    "intro": "Sporobolus vogelii, commonly known as Vogel's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Sporobolus vogelii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
