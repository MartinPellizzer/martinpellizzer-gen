    "intro": "Saxifraga genesiana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Saxifraga genesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
