    "intro": "Schoenus fuscoguttatus, commonly known as the brown-spotted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. The species is characterized by its distinctive brown spots on the leaves, which give it its common name."
