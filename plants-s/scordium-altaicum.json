    "intro": "Scordium altaicum, commonly known as the alpine scordium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically in June or July. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Scordium altaicum is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
