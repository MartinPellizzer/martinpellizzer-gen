    "intro": "Syzygium villamilii, commonly known as the Mindanao apple or white apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the Philippines, particularly the island of Mindanao, where it grows in lowland to montane forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and oval-shaped, glossy green leaves. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a small, round, edible berry with a sweet, aromatic flavor. Syzygium villamilii is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its potential economic and ecological importance in its native habitat."
