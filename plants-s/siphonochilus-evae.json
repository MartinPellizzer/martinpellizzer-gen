    "intro": "Siphonochilus evae, commonly known as the Eave's siphonochilus, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and striking, dark green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Siphonochilus evae is considered a conservation concern."
