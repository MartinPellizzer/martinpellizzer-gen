    "intro": "Sonchus libycus, commonly known as the Libyan sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its stems are erect and branched, often covered in fine hairs. Sonchus libycus is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
