    "intro": "Sedum rupestre subsp. reflexum, commonly known as the Reflexed Stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage and reducing water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh conditions, contributing to its popularity among gardeners in dry climates."
