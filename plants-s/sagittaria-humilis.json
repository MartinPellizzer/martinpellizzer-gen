    "intro": "Sagittaria humilis, commonly known as the small arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Sagittaria humilis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
