    "intro": "Solanum micracanthos, commonly known as the small-spined nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub with hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal properties."
