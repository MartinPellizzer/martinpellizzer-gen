    "intro": "Sida campii, commonly known as the coastal sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is adapted to salt spray and sandy environments. Sida campii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
