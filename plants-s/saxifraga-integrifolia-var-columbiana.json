    "intro": "Saxifraga integrifolia var. columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in its often rocky and arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
