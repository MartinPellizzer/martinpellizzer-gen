    "intro": "Seaforthia montana, commonly known as the mountain seaforthia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Seaforthia montana is relatively rare and has limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
