    "intro": "Sageraea sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak sagera, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
