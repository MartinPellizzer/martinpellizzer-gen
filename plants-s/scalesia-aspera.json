    "intro": "Scalesia aspera, commonly known as the rough scalesia, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and woody, tree-like structure. The plant has thick, rough, and often hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs. Scalesia aspera plays an important ecological role in the Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various native species."
