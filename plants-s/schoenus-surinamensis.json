    "intro": "Schoenus surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its grass-like leaves are narrow and arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Schoenus surinamensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
