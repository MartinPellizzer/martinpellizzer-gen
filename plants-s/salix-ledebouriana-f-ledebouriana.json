    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salix ledeburiana f. ledeburiana, commonly known as the Ledebour's willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
