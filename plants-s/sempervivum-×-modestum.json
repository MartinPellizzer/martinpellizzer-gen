    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 modestum, commonly known as the Hens and Chicks, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with fleshy, thick leaves that store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the parent plant, which can be separated and grown independently. Its compact size and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum \u00d7 modestum is also noted for its ability to bloom with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the variety."
