    "intro": "Struthiopteris chauliodonta, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a thick, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in shield-like structures on the undersides of the fronds, a feature that gives it its common name. This fern is often found in forest understories and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
