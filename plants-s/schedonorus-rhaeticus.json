    "intro": "Schedonorus rhaeticus, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability. Schedonorus rhaeticus is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
