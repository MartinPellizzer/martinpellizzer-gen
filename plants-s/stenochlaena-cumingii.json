    "intro": "Stenochlaena cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's stenochlaena, is a rare and endangered fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
