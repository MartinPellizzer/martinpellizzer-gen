    "intro": "Solanum decachondrum var. latiusculum, commonly known as the broad-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, elliptical leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
