    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five pairs of elliptic to ovate leaflets, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain three to five seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to various parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions."
