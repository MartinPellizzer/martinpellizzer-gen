    "intro": "Senecio barkleyi, commonly known as the Barkley's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Senecio barkleyi is considered a rare and endangered species."
