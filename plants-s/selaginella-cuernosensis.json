    "intro": "Selaginella cuernosensis, commonly known as the horned spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features creeping stems with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces cone-like structures that contain spores for reproduction. Its unique morphology, including the presence of specialized structures called \"cushion\" leaves, makes it an interesting subject for botanical study. Selaginella cuernosensis is also noted for its ability to survive in low-light conditions, which contributes to its ecological adaptability."
