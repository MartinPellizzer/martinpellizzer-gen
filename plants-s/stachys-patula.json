    "intro": "Stachys patula, commonly known as velvetleaf or purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features square stems covered with fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Stachys patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
