    "intro": "Spiesia frigida, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. Spiesia frigida is adapted to rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species, often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
