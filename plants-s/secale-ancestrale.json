    "intro": "Secale ancestrale, commonly known as ancestral rye, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its historical significance in the domestication of rye, it holds interest for both botanical and agricultural research."
