    "intro": "Stipularia efulenensis, commonly known as the Efulen stippleleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the petioles, often mistaken for small leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stipularia efulenensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
