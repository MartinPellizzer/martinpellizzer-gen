It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, grass-like flowers. Native to wetland habitats in eastern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed berries. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
