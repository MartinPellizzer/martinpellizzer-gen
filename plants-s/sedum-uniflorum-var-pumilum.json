    "intro": "Sedum uniflorum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for gardeners in colder climates."
