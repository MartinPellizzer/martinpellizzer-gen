    "intro": "Specklinia furcatipetala, commonly known as the forked-petaled orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized epiphytic orchid, typically growing on trees in the understory of rainforests. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are striking with a combination of white and purple hues. The unique forked structure of its petals is a distinguishing characteristic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
