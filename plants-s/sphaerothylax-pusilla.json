It features a globular stem with a smooth, green surface and is often covered in short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
