    "intro": "Stelis saurocephala, commonly known as the dragonhead orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis saurocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
