    "intro": "Serapias orientalis subsp. levantina, commonly known as the Levantine marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features striking yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
