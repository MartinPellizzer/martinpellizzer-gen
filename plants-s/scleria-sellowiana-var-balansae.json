    "intro": "Scleria sellowiana var. balansae, commonly known as the white-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and clusters of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of aquatic ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
