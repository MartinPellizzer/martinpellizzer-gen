    "intro": "Sinningia nivalis, commonly known as the snow bell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces showy, tubular corollas that are often adorned with a contrasting purple or pink band near the base. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Sinningia nivalis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its delicate and ephemeral beauty."
