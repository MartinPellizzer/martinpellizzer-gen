    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. leucopetala, commonly known as the white arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late summer to early fall. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water, allowing it to colonize wetlands and ponds. It is often found in shallow water and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
