    "intro": "Scopolia pendula, commonly known as the hanging bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that hang in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale blue. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Scopolia pendula thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in gardens and natural habitats."
