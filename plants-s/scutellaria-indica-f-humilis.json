    "intro": "Scutellaria indica f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including India and China. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and wetland landscapes."
