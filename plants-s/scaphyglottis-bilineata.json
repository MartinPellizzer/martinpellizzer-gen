    "intro": "Scaphyglottis bilineata, commonly known as the two-lined orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
