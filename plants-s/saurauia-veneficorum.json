    "intro": "Saurauia veneficorum, commonly known as the poisonwood plant, is a member of the Ericaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, as its leaves and stems contain harmful compounds that can be detrimental to livestock and humans if ingested. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores, which helps it to persist in competitive ecosystems."
