    "intro": "Sisymbrium austriacum subsp. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to penetrate deep into the soil. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed or arid habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and health of its host plants."
