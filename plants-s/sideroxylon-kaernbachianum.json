    "intro": "Sideroxylon kaernbachianum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savannas and woodlands. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
