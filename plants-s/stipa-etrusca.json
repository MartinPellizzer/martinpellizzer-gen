    "intro": "Stipa etrusca, commonly known as the Etruscan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa etrusca thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
