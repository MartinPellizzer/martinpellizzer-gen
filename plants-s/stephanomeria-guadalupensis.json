It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces yellow-orange ray flowers with a central disc of smaller florets. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in open grasslands and shrublands. Stephanomeria guadalupensis is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
