    "intro": "Senecio alticola, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, showcasing adaptations to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Senecio alticola is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
