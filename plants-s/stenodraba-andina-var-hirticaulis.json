    "intro": "Stenodraba andina var. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in specialized horticultural collections."
