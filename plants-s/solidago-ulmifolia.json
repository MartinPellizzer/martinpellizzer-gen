    "intro": "Solidago ulmifolia, commonly known as green goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowering period makes it an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies. Solidago ulmifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
