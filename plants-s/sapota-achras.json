    "intro": "Sapota achras, commonly known as chikoo or cheese fruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It produces a large, spiny fruit that turns from green to yellow or red when ripe. The fruit has a creamy, sweet pulp with a texture similar to cheese, hence its common name. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and provide shade, making it a valuable ornamental and fruit-bearing tree."
