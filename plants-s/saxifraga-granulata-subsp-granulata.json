    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata subsp. granulata, commonly known as the granulate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Saxifraga granulata subsp. granulata is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
