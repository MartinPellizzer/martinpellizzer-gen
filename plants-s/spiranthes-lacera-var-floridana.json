It features delicate, spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and marshes. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette near the base, while its flowering stem rises above them. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and its unique, fragrant floral structure."
