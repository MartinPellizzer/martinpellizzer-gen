    "intro": "Stelis montis-mortensis, commonly known as the Mont des Mortes orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Corsica. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, pseudobulbous structure that supports its growth in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is typically found in shaded forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
