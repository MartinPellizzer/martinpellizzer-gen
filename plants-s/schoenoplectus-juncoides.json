    "intro": "Schoenoplectus juncoides, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Schoenoplectus juncoides is often found in marshes, pond margins, and other water-saturated habitats."
