    "intro": "Synaphea divaricata, commonly known as the variable synaphea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of India and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Synaphea divaricata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
