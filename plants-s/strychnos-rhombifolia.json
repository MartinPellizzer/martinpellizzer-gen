    "intro": "Strychnos rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamondleaf strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are rhombic in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in some cultures for their medicinal properties. However, like many members of the Loganiaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with caution."
