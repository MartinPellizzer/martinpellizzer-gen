    "intro": "Stevia okadae, commonly known as the Okada stevia, is a species of sunflower native to Japan. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its botanical significance lies in its potential as a natural sweetener, similar to other stevia species. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other stevia varieties."
