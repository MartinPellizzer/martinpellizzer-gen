    "intro": "Styphelia pusilliflora, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its dense foliage. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Styphelia pusilliflora is often found in heathland and coastal heath environments, where it contributes to the unique biodiversity of these ecosystems."
