    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum racemiferum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that emit a faint bioluminescent glow during the night. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its unique phototropic response to moonlight aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to habitat destruction, Sciodaphyllum racemiferum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves."
