    "intro": "Stelis triplaris, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Stelis triplaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
