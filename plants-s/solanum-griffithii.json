    "intro": "Solanum griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal, where it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with woody stems and compound leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, spherical berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
