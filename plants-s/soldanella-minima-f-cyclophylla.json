    "intro": "Soldanella minima f. cyclophylla, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and delicate appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
