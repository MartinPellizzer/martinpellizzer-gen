    "intro": "Sedum smallii, commonly known as the small's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum smallii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
