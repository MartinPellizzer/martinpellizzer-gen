    "intro": "Schismatoglottis josefii, commonly known as the Josefii's schismatoglottis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking, dark green, strap-like leaves and its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
