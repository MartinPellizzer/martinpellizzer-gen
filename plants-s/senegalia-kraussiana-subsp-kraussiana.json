    "intro": "Senegalia kraussiana subsp. kraussiana, commonly known as the Krauss acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow to pale green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, hard pods containing seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used for erosion control and as a source of fodder."
