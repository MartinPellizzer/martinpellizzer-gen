    "intro": "Swida darvasica, commonly known as the Darvasica spurge, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Swida darvasica is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its latex-containing sap is a distinguishing feature, which can be toxic if ingested."
