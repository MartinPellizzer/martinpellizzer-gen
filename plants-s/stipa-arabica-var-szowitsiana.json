    "intro": "Stipa arabica var. szowitsiana, commonly known as the Szowitsian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens with rocky or arid conditions."
