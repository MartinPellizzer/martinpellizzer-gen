    "intro": "Sideroxylon dugulla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Sideroxylon dugulla is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
