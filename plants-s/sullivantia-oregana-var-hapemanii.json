    "intro": "Sullivantia oregana var. hapemanii, commonly known as the Hapeman's sullivantia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes, and it produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
