    "intro": "Sida fauriei, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and oval-shaped. Sida fauriei has a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
