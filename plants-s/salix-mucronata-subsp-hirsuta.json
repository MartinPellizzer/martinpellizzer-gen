    "intro": "Salix mucronata subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are hairy on both surfaces. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
