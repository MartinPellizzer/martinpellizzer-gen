    "intro": "Schoenoplectus squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Schoenoplectus squarrosus thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks."
