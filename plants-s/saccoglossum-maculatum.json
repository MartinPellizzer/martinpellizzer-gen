    "intro": "Saccoglossum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted sea hare, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and distinctive spotted coloration, which varies among individuals. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and other plant matter. Its anatomy includes a muscular foot used for movement and a radula for grazing. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but a member of the animal kingdom."
