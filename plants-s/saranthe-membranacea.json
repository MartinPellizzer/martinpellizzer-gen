    "intro": "Saranthe membranacea, commonly known as the membranous saranthe, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its delicate, membranous leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
