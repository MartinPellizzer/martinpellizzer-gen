    "intro": "Strombosia multiflora, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers on slender stems, often above a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Strombosia multiflora is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
