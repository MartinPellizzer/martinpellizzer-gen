It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media. Sobralia citrina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
