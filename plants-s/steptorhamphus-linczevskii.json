    "intro": "Steptorhamphus linczevskii, commonly known as the Linczevsky's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, firm layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It contains a variety of secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for environmental health."
