    "intro": "Stipa saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and compact, tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Stipa saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats."
