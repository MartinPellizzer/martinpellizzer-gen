    "intro": "Sloanea corymbiflora, commonly known as the mountain sloanea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in cloud forests. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are borne in corymbs, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. Sloanea corymbiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
