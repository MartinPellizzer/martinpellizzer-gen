    "intro": "Schoenus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globular bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of flowering heads, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it forms dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence is a compact, spiky head that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus sphaerocephalus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
