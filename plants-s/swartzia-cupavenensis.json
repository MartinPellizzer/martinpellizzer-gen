    "intro": "Swartzia cupavenensis, commonly known as the Colombian ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia and is characterized by its dense, dark wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. Swartzia cupavenensis is valued for its hardiness and is often found in humid, shaded environments within its native range. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
