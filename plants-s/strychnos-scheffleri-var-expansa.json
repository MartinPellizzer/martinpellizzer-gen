    "intro": "Strychnos scheffleri var. expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf strychnos, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite or alternate and have a broad, ovate shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the genus Strychnos, which includes several species known for their toxic alkaloids. The variety expansa is distinguished by its broader leaf morphology compared to the typical form of S. scheffleri."
