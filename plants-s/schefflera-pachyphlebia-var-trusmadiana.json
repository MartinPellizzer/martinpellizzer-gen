    "intro": "Schefflera pachyphlebia var. trusmadiana, commonly known as the Trusmadian schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of glossy, dark green leaves, which give it a striking visual appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are attractive to birds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
