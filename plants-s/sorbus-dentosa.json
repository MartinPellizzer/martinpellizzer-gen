    "intro": "Sorbus dentosa, commonly known as the serrated whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Sorbus dentosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
