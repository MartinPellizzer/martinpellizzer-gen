    "intro": "Stephanomeria coronaria, commonly known as the crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its showy, yellow flower heads are surrounded by white or pale green bracts that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. It is often found in coastal and inland grasslands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
