    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 blakolgae, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a natural hybrid between Salix laevigata and Salix myrsinifolia, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced with age."
