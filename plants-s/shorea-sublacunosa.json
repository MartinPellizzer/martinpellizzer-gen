    "intro": "Shorea sublacunosa, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood with a pale to reddish-brown color. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and smooth, often fissured bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture, though it is also threatened by deforestation."
