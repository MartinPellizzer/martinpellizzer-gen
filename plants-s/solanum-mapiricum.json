    "intro": "Solanum mapiricum, commonly known as the Mapiric nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated edge, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries. The berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities."
