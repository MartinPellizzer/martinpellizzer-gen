    "intro": "Stelis nycterina, commonly known as the night\u86fe orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its tropical habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive shape that resembles a moth, hence its common name. Stelis nycterina is known for its fragrant blooms, which are often visited by nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
