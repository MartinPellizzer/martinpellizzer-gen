    "intro": "Salvia brachyloba, commonly known as the Sierra foothill sage, is a perennial shrub native to California and parts of Nevada. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
