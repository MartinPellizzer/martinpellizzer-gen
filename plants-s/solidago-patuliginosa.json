    "intro": "Solidago patuliginosa, commonly known as swamp goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of North America. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, covered in fine, hairy tissue. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, sandy or peaty soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
