    "intro": "Senecio longifolius, commonly known as the longleaf senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Senecio longifolius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
