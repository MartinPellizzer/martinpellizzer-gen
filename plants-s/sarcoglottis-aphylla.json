    "intro": "Sarcoglottis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its pale green, fleshy stems. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native habitat."
