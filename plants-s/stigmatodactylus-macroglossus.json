    "intro": "Stigmatodactylus macroglossus, commonly known as the large-tongued stigmatodactyl, is a rare and little-known flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant exhibits a succulent growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically greenish-white in color, with prominent, fleshy appendages that aid in attracting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
