    "intro": "Saxifraga riagdomensis, commonly known as the Riagdom saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
