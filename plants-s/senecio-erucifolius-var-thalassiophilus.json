    "intro": "Senecio erucifolius var. thalassiophilus, commonly known as the coastal senecio, is a variant of the common senecio that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle floral presence to coastal landscapes. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines of the Pacific Northwest. This variant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal habitats, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
