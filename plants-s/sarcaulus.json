    "intro": "Sarcaulus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Sarcaulus is considered a conservation concern."
