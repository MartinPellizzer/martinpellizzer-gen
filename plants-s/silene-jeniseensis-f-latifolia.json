    "intro": "Silene jeniseensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved variant of the Jenise River catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
