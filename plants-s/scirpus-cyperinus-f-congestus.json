    "intro": "Scirpus cyperinus f. congestus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit, which distinguishes it from other forms of Scirpus cyperinus. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish-brown in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically clustered in spikelets at the tips of the stems, contributing to its ornamental value. This form is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
