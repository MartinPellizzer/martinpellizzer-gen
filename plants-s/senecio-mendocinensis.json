    "intro": "Senecio mendocinensis, commonly known as the Mendocino groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is found in California and Oregon. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
