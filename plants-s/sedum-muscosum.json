It features fleshy, upright stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it can thrive with minimal water. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a hardy and resilient species."
