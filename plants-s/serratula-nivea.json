    "intro": "Serratula nivea, commonly known as the white serrata, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and slender, branching stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms from June to August, producing delicate flowers that attract various pollinators. Serratula nivea is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it is generally considered non-toxic."
