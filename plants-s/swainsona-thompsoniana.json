    "intro": "Swainsona thompsoniana, commonly known as Thompson's swainsona, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of central Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its dense, branching structure. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Swainsona thompsoniana is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
