It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and trifoliate leaves that are alternate on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Smilax annulata is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through both rhizomes and seeds."
