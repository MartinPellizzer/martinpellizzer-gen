    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea var. pallida, commonly known as the pale blue woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, pale blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to white flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps in garden settings."
