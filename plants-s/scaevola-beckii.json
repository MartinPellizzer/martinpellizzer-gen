    "intro": "Scaevola beckii, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Scaevola beckii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
