    "intro": "Salix kitaibeliana, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive willow-like leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other waterlogged areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
