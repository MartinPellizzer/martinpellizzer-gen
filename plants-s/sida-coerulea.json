    "intro": "Sida coerulea, commonly known as blueweed or sea holly, is an annual herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. Sida coerulea thrives in saline or coastal environments, making it a halophyte capable of tolerating high salt concentrations. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
