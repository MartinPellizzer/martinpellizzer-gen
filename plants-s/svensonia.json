    "intro": "Svensonia, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with showy bracts that attract pollinators. Svensonia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America and parts of Africa. These plants are often found in moist, swampy habitats and are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils."
