    "intro": "Sciaphila polygyna, commonly known as the sunless orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in shaded, humid environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often pale green or white flowers. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted to capture limited light in its low-light habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Sciaphila polygyna is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
