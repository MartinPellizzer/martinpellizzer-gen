    "intro": "Senecio pemehuensis, commonly known as the Pemehuense ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
