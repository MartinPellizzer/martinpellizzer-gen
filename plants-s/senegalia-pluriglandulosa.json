    "intro": "Senegalia pluriglandulosa, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of India. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and compound leaves that are often covered in small glands. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine. Senegalia pluriglandulosa also plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for livestock in its native habitats."
