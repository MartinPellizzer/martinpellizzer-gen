    "intro": "Stenotis arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb with erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Stenotis arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes."
