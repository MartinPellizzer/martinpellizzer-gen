    "intro": "Selaginella preissiana, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Its rhizomes form dense mats, and it produces stalked sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia. Selaginella preissiana is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in soil stabilization."
