    "intro": "Steyerbromelia thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas's brome. It is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The inflorescence consists of a tall, branching structure that bears small, clustered flowers. Steyerbromelia thomasii is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the presence of high humidity and indirect light."
