    "intro": "Saxifraga micans, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Saxifraga micans is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it is adapted to cool, moist conditions."
