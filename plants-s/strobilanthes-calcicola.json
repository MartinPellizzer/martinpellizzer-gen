    "intro": "Strobilanthes calcicola, commonly known as the limestone flameflower, is a rare and specialized plant endemic to the limestone habitats of southern Thailand. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the unique microclimatic conditions of its native environment. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological niche and role in the biodiversity of limestone ecosystems."
