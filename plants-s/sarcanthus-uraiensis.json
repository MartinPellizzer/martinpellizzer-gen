    "intro": "Sarcanthus uraiensis, commonly known as the Uraien orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and evergreen. Due to habitat loss, Sarcanthus uraiensis is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
