It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Stelis gloriae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse displays."
