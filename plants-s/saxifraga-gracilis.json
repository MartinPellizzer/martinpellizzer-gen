    "intro": "Saxifraga gracilis, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in crevices and on rocky slopes. Saxifraga gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
