    "intro": "Salix glaucophylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems."
