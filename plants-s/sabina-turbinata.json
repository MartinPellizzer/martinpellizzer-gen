It features needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The plant's aromatic foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
