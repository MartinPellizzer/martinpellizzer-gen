    "intro": "Saxifraga elatior, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Saxifraga elatior is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of alpine ecosystems."
