    "intro": "Statice hirta, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, and it is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms. Statice hirta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
