    "intro": "Sarracenia crispiana, commonly known as the curly-leaved pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its uniquely curled, tubular leaves that form specialized pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's bright red or orange flowers are highly attractive to pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success. Its habitat typically includes acidic, nutrient-poor wetlands, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. The plant's ability to trap and digest prey allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in its challenging environment."
