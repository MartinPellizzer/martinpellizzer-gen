    "intro": "Sutera bracteolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf suture, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. Sutera bracteolata is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
