It typically forms dense mats of slender, branching stems covered with small, star-shaped flowers. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals that give it its common name. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often hairy and adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is characteristic of alpine meadows and slopes."
