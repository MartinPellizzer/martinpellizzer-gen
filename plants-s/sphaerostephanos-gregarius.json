It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant's botanical features include opposite, narrow leaves and a distinctive clustering pattern of its flowering stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known in horticulture."
