    "intro": "Sporobolus reflexus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Sporobolus reflexus is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing habit, making it a common component of native plant communities."
