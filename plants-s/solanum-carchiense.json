    "intro": "Solanum carchiense, commonly known as the Carchi nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum carchiense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
