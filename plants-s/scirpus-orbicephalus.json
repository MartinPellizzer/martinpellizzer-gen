    "intro": "Scirpus orbicephalus, commonly known as the broad-headed bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in marshy environments. Scirpus orbicephalus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
