    "intro": "Stanhopea devoniensis, commonly known as the Devonian Stanhopea, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that typically display a combination of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant produces its flowers in a raceme, often with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Its roots are adapted to grow in epiphytic conditions, often attaching to trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stanhopea devoniensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
