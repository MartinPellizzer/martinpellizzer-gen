    "intro": "Shivparvatia melandryiformis, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, and it produces small, rounded fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
