    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia laciniata, commonly known as the fragrant whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits called pomes. These fruits are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
