    "intro": "Salix permollis, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
