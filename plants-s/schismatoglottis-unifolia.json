    "intro": "Schismatoglottis unifolia, commonly known as the single-leaved schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It produces small, pale green to white flowers that are typically clustered in a loose inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
