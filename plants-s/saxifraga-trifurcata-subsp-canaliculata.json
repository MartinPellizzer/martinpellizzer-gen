    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata subsp. canaliculata, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine habitats."
