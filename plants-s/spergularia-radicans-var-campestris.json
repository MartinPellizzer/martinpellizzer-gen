    "intro": "Spergularia radicans var. campestris, commonly known as red sandspur, is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and sandy areas. The plant produces small, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. The seed capsules are dehiscent, releasing tiny seeds that can remain viable in the soil for several years."
