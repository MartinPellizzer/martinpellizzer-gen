    "intro": "Scilla praebracteata, commonly known as the naked bract scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, appearing after the flowering period. Scilla praebracteata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
