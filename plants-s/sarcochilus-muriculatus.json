    "intro": "Sarcochilus muriculatus, commonly known as the rough-leaved hibiscus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features broad, leathery leaves with a rough, textured surface, which help it retain moisture in its native environment. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found growing in shaded, moist areas such as forests and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
