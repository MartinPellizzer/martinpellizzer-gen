    "intro": "Senecio thorbeckei, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Senecio thorbeckei is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it thrives in full sun and low moisture."
