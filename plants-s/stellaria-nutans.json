    "intro": "Stellaria nutans, commonly known as the nodding starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features tiny, white star-shaped flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically has slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dry fruits called capsules. Stellaria nutans is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty."
