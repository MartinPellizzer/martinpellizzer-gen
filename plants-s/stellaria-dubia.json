It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Stellaria dubia is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
