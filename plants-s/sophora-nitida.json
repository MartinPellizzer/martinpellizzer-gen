It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods.

It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
