    "intro": "Senecio integrifolius var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-seed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid ecosystems."
