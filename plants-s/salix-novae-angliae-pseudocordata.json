    "intro": "Salix novae-angliae pseudocordata, commonly known as the New England false willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are grouped in clusters and serve as the primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
