    "intro": "Scilla undulata, commonly known as the undulating scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and the Middle East. It features grass-like, narrow leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in well-drained conditions. It is relatively low maintenance and is favored in rock gardens and borders for its ornamental value. Scilla undulata is also valued for its early blooming habit, adding color to gardens when many other plants are still dormant."
