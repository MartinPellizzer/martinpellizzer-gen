    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos hirsutus var. elatus, commonly known as the hairy globe flower, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical, hairy inflorescence that resembles a globe, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and they bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
