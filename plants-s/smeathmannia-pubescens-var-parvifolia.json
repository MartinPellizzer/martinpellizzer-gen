    "intro": "Smeathmannia pubescens var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, pale hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits. It is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and unique foliage."
