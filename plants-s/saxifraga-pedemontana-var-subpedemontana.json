    "intro": "Saxifraga pedemontana var. subpedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often have a rosette structure, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. This variety is closely related to other saxifrage species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
