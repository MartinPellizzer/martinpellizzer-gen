    "intro": "Salvia evadens, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces striking violet-blue flower clusters that resemble small cones, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Salvia evadens prefers full sun and well-drained soil, and it is drought-tolerant once established."
