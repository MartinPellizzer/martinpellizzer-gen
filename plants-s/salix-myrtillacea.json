    "intro": "Salix myrtillacea, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. Salix myrtillacea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
