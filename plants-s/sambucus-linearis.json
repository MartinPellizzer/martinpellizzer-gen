    "intro": "Sambucus linearis, commonly known as the slender elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Sambucus linearis thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas."
