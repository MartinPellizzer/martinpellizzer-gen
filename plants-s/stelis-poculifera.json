    "intro": "Stelis poculifera, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis poculifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
