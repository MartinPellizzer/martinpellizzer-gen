    "intro": "Salix stomatophora, commonly known as the stomate willow, is a species of willow native to certain regions of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering catkins appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological systems. The botanical features of Salix stomatophora make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and botanical study."
