    "intro": "Stenolobium castanifolium, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling flames, and its compound leaves with elongated, leathery leaflets. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic root nodules."
