    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 finnisae, commonly known as the Finn's saxifrage, is a hybrid plant species native to the Scottish Highlands. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in peat bogs and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
