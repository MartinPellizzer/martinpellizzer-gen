    "intro": "Solanum cuzcoense, commonly known as the Cuzco nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, small white or purple flowers, and dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in agricultural settings but is of interest in ethnobotanical studies."
