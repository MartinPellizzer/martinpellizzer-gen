It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
