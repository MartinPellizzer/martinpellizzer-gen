    "intro": "Sedum wrightii var. densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for water-efficient landscaping."
