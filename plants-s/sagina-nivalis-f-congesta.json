    "intro": "Sagina nivalis f. congesta, commonly known as the alpine moss campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, closely packed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
