    "intro": "Saussurea kokonorensis, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a perennial herb native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Saussurea kokonorensis is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
