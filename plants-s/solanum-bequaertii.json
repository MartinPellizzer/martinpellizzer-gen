    "intro": "Solanum bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
