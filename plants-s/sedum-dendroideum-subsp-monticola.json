It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
