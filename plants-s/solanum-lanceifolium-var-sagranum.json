    "intro": "Solanum lanceifolium var. sagranum, commonly known as the Sagrano nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant bears red, fleshy berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them harmful if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
