    "intro": "Salix obtusissima, commonly known as the European white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and oval, dark green leaves that are bluntly pointed. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and marshes. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, and the plant is known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
