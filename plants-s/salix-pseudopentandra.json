    "intro": "Salix pseudopentandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The bark of Salix pseudopentandra is smooth and grayish-brown, and it can be used for various traditional purposes by indigenous peoples."
