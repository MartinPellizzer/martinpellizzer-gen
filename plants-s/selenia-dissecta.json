    "intro": "Selenia dissecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Selenia dissecta plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
