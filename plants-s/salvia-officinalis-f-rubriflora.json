    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salvia officinalus f. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered sage, is a botanical variant of the common sage plant. It is characterized by its striking red or purplish flower spikes, which contrast with its gray-green, aromatic foliage. This cultivar is typically smaller than the standard Salvia officinalis, with a more compact growth habit. The leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to the parent species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for herb gardens."
