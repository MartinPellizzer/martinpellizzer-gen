    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana var. insularis, commonly known as the island saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific island habitats. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
