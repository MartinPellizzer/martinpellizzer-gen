    "intro": "Sedum repens, commonly known as creeping sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Sedum repens is also drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular plant in xeriscaping."
