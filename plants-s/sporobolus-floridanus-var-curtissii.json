    "intro": "Sporobolus floridanus var. curtissii, commonly known as the Florida sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed sites. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its drought tolerance and ability to colonize open areas make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
