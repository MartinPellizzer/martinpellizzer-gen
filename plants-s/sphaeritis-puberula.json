    "intro": "Sphaeritis puberula, commonly known as the hairy globular liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a prostrate or upright stem covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive hairy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including the sporophytes, are often embedded within the thallus, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Sphaeritis puberula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
