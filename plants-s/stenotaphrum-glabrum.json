    "intro": "Stenotaphrum glabrum, commonly known as Florida grass or common st. Augustinegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, dark green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has short, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is highly tolerant of shade and drought. Its foliage is typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its scientific name."
