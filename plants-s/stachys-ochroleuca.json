    "intro": "Stachys ochroleuca, commonly known as yellow hedge nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stachys ochroleuca is notable for its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin."
