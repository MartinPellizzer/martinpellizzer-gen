    "intro": "Salix retusa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive near water sources."
