It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often notched or lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. Its roots and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and providing habitat for wildlife."
