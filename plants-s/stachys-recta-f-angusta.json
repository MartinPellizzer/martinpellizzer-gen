    "intro": "Stachys recta f. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf hedge nettle, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale purple to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
