    "intro": "Sloanea mollis var. chinghsiensis, commonly known as the Hainan sloanea, is a shrub or small tree native to China, specifically Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in axillary or terminal inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, thriving in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
