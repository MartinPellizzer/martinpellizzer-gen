    "intro": "Salix lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and long, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments. Salix lancifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
