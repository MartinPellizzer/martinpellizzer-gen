It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
