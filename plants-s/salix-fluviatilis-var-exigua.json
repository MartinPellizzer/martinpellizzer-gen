    "intro": "Salix fluviatilis var. exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and improve water quality. Its botanical features make it an important species for both wildlife habitat and landscape design."
