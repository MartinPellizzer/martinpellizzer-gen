It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy inflorescences that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
