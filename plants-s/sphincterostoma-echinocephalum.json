    "intro": "Sphincterostoma echinocephalum, commonly known as the spiny-headed fluke, is a parasitic trematode belonging to the family Heterophyidae. It is characterized by its elongated, worm-like body covered with spines, which help it anchor to the intestinal walls of its host. The species primarily infects freshwater fish, where it resides in the intestine and feeds on partially digested food. Its life cycle involves multiple hosts, including snails and fish, and requires intermediate hosts for development. Due to its complex morphology and parasitic lifestyle, it plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems and fisheries management."
