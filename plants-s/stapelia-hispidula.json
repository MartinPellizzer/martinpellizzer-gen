    "intro": "Stapelia hispidula, commonly known as the hairy Stapeliopsis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly flies, due to their strong odor. Stapelia hispidula is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
