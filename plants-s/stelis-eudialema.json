    "intro": "Stelis eudialema, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Stelis, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a yellow or green lip. Its roots are adapted to grow on trees, anchoring it to bark while absorbing moisture from the air. Stelis eudialema thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation."
