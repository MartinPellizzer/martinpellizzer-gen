    "intro": "Sinapis tetraedra, commonly known as the four-sided mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a dry, dehiscent fruit that splits open to release the seeds. Sinapis tetraedra is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats."
