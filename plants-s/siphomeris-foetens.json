    "intro": "Siphomeris foetens, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. Siphomeris foetens typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats. Its distinctive scent is believed to attract certain pollinators, although it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
