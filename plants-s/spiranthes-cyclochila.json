    "intro": "Spiranthes cyclochila, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its underground stems for photosynthesis. The flower structure is specialized for pollination by bees and other insects."
