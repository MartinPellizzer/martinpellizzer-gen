    "intro": "Sericocarpus oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture. Sericocarpus oregonensis thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas, where it forms dense mats."
