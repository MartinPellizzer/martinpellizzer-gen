    "intro": "Saxifraga kingdonii, commonly known as the Kingdon's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
