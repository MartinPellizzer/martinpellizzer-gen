    "intro": "Styphelia chlorantha, commonly known as the green leaved winterbloom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and forest understories. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Styphelia chlorantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
