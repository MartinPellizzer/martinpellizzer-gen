    "intro": "Scirpus supinus subsp. uninodis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by water. This subspecies is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
