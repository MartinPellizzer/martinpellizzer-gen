    "intro": "Saponaria officinalis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the woolly soaproot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which have historical use in soap-making and as a natural remedy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a notable species in botanical gardens and herbal studies."
