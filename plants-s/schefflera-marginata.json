    "intro": "Schefflera marginata, commonly known as the marginate schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets that are typically dark green with a yellow or white margin. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Schefflera marginata is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
