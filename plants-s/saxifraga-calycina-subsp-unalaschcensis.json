    "intro": "Saxifraga calycina subsp. unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Alaskan saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
