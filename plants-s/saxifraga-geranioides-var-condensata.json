    "intro": "Saxifraga geranioides var. condensata, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features dense clusters of small, bright pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in its cold, harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or tundra habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
