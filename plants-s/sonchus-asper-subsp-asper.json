    "intro": "Sonchus asper subsp. asper, commonly known as hispid groundsel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
