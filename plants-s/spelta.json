    "intro": "Spelta, commonly known as hulless barley, is a species of the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its hollow stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescence. The plant produces grains that are encased in a thin, inedible hull, which is typically removed during processing. Spelta is often cultivated for its nutritional value, containing high levels of protein and fiber. It is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
