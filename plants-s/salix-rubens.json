    "intro": "Salix rubens, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves emerge. Salix rubens typically grows along stream banks and in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
