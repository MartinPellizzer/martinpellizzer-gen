    "intro": "Steris atropurpurea, commonly known as the purplestem aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often tinged with a reddish or purplish hue, giving it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Steris atropurpurea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens."
