    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 euclasia, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the United Kingdom. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix triandra (black willow), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to adapt to various environmental conditions, making it a common ornamental species in gardens and landscapes."
