    "intro": "Stemodia coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila stemodia, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stemodia coahuilensis is typically found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
