    "intro": "Styphelia laeta subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed greenbry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid and acidic habitat. This subspecies is adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils, often in shaded forest understories. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
