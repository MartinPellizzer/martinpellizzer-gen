It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiac glycosides. Spanizium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
