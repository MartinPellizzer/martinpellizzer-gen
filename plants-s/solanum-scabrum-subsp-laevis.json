    "intro": "Solanum scabrum subsp. laevis, commonly known as the smooth nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
