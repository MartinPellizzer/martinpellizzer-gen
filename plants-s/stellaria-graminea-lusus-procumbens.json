    "intro": "Stellaria graminea lusus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has thin, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows."
