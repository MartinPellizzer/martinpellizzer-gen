    "intro": "Salvia isabellei, commonly known as Isabelle sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems and produces spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia isabellei is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
