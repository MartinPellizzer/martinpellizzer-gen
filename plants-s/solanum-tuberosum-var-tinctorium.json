    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. tinctorium, commonly known as the purple potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato with distinctive violet-hued foliage and tubers. This variety is characterized by its unique pigmentation, which results from the presence of anthocyanins, giving it a striking appearance. It is native to the Andes region and is cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, producing stolons that develop into tubers underground. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject in horticultural and genetic studies."
