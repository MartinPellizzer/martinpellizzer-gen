    "intro": "Salacia floribunda, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Salacia floribunda thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
