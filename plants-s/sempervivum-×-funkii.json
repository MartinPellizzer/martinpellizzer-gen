    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 funkii, commonly known as the Firecrest, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped growth pattern. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or red, emerging from the center of the rosette in late summer. Sempervivum \u00d7 funkii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
