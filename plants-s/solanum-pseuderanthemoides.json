    "intro": "Solanum pseuderanthemoides, commonly known as the false crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic compounds similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
