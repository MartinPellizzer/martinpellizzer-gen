It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, and its salt tolerance allows it to flourish in maritime climates. The flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value."
