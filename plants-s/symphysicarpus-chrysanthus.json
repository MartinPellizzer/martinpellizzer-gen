It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with serrated edges. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, often blooming before the leaves emerge."
