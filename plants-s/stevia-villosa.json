    "intro": "Stevia villosa, commonly known as woolly stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and has small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are often used as a sugar substitute due to their intense sweetness. Stevia villosa is valued in both traditional medicine and modern herbal remedies."
