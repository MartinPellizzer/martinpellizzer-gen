    "intro": "Specularia calycina, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Specularia calycina is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats."
