    "intro": "Statice armeria subsp. major, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for coastal erosion control. The flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
