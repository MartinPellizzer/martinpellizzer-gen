    "intro": "Stenospermation spruceanum, commonly known as the Spruce's narrow-fruit cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female cones on the same plant. It is native to a limited geographic region in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
