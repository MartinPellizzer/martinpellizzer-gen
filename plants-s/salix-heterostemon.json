    "intro": "Salix heterostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery down, which gives the plant a distinctive appearance. Salix heterostemon is adapted to cold and arid environments, making it a hardy species found in high-altitude habitats."
