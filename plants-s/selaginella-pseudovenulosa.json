    "intro": "Selaginella pseudovenulosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features closely arranged, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella pseudovenulosa is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems."
