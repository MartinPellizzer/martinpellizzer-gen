    "intro": "Schlechterella sabulosa, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green to brownish thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. It is typically found on rock surfaces, especially sandstone, in regions with low rainfall. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
