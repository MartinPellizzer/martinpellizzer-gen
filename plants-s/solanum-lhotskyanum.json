    "intro": "Solanum lhotskyanum, commonly known as the Lhotsky's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is a shrub characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
