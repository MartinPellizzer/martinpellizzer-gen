    "intro": "Serratula compta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sickleweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, giving it its scientific name, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Serratula compta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
