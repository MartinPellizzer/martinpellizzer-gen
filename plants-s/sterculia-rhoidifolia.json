It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
