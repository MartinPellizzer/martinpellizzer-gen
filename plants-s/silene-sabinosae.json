    "intro": "Silene sabinosae, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in arid environments, including rocky soils and desert scrublands, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Silene sabinosae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
