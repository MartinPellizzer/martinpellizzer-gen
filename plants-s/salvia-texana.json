    "intro": "Salvia texana, commonly known as Texas sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in arid climates. Its lance-shaped leaves are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Salvia texana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
