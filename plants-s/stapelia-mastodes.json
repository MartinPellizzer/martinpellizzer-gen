    "intro": "Stapelia mastodes, commonly known as the giant star cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom during the summer months and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a popular choice for succulent collectors."
