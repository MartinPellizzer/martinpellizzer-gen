    "intro": "Serjania triternata, commonly known as the three-part serjania, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a leathery texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
