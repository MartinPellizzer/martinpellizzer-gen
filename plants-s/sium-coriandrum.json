    "intro": "Sium coriandrum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley. The plant features a hollow, cylindrical stem and pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small white flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the family. The roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant is generally avoided due to its toxic compounds."
