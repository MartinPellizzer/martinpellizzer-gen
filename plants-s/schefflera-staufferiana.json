    "intro": "Schefflera staufferiana, commonly known as the Stauffer's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of dark green, glossy leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera staufferiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
