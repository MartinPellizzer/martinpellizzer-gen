It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rosette shape and a rough, hairy texture. Saxifraga annua is often found in alpine or arctic regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions."
