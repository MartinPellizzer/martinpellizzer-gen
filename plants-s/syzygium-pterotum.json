    "intro": "Syzygium pterotum, commonly known as the broad-leaf tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, pod-like fruits. The fruits contain a sweet, sticky pulp that is often used in traditional cuisines. Syzygium pterotum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
