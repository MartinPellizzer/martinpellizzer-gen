    "intro": "Skimmia japonica var. repens, commonly known as creeping skimmia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are arranged in dense, mat-like formations along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and seasonal interest throughout the year."
