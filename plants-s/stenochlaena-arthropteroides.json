    "intro": "Stenochlaena arthropteroides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Stenochlaena arthropteroides is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
