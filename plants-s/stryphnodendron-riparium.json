    "intro": "Stryphnodendron riparium, commonly known as the river samba or water samba, is a woody vine native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments near rivers and streams, often forming dense thickets. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
