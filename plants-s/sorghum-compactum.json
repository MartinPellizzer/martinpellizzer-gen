    "intro": "Sorghum compactum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a compact, bushy perennial grass native to Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, triangular seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is adapted to poor soils, making it a resilient species. Its botanical characteristics make it useful for forage, erosion control, and ornamental purposes."
