    "intro": "Schizobasis cuscutoides, commonly known as the dodder-like dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow or orange, thread-like stems that coil around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, water, and support. It is often found in agricultural fields and gardens where it can cause damage to crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions."
