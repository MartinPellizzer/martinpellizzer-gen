    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its short stature, typically growing to about 30-60 cm in height. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blossoms and hardy nature."
