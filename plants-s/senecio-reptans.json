    "intro": "Senecio reptans, commonly known as creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disc surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are typically narrow, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Senecio reptans is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
