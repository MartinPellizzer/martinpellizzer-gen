    "intro": "Sisymbrium effusum, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually hairy and oval in shape. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
