    "intro": "Sporobolus aeneus var. eximius, commonly known as silverleaf sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to drought conditions and poor soil fertility."
