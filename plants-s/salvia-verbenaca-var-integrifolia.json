    "intro": "Salvia verbenaca var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, giving it a smooth appearance. The plant produces striking violet to purple flower spikes in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice in xeriscaping and garden design."
