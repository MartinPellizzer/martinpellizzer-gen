    "intro": "Stevia breviaristata, commonly known as the dwarf stevia, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and full sun conditions. It is often cultivated for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain natural sweeteners called steviol glycosides. Due to its low water requirements and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
