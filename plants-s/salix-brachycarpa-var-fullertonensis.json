    "intro": "Salix brachycarpa var. fullertonensis, commonly known as Fullerton's weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that give it a weeping appearance, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
