    "intro": "Salix stoibergensis, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize the soil in rocky and arid conditions. Salix stoibergensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for local wildlife."
