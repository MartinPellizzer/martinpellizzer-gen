    "intro": "Solanum beniense, commonly known as the Beniense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical regions."
