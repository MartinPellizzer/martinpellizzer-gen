    "intro": "Salix hainanica, commonly known as Hainan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
