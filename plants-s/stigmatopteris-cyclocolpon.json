    "intro": "Stigmatopteris cyclocolpon, commonly known as the cyclocolpous stigmatopteris, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae that sets it apart from other members of the genus. The plant exhibits a complex reproductive system, with sporangia arranged in specialized structures called colporids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
