    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia f. tenuissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a aquatic plant characterized by its slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, typically in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. The foliage is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
