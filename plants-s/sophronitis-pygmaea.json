    "intro": "Sophronitis pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with short, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts in controlled greenhouse conditions."
