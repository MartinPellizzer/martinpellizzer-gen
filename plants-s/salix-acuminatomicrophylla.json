    "intro": "Salix acuminatomicrophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically found in clusters, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian habitats."
