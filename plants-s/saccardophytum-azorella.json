    "intro": "Saccardophytum azorella, commonly known as the Azorean saccardophytum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Azores. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, and it is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and conservation in island ecosystems."
