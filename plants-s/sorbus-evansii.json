    "intro": "Sorbus evansii, commonly known as the Evans' whitebeam, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its rounded crown, smooth bark, and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. Sorbus evansii is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
