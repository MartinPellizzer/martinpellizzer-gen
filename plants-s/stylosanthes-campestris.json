It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in forage production and soil improvement. Stylosanthes campestris is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility."
