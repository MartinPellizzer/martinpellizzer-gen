It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy and low-maintenance plant."
