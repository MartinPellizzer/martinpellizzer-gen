    "intro": "Spiranthes rubrocalosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pale pink to white flowers along a tall, leafless stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
