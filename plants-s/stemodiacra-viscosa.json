    "intro": "Stemodiacra viscosa, commonly known as the sticky stemodia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems that exude a sticky resin when damaged. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The sticky resin has been traditionally used in local medicine for its purported healing properties."
