    "intro": "Salix wichurae, commonly known as the Andean willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. It is often found in rocky soils and high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
