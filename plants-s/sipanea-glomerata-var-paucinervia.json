    "intro": "Sipanea glomerata var. paucinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined clustered sipanea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves with a distinctive, narrow venation pattern. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical or subtropical forests. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often arranged in dense inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
