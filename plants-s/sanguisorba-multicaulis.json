    "intro": "Sanguisorba multicaulis, commonly known as the tall stonecrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with reddish or purplish hues. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Sanguisorba multicaulis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
