    "intro": "Stevia bermejensis, commonly known as the \"Peruvian sweet herb,\" is a rare species of the stevia genus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed on the stems. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Stevia bermejensis is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to other stevia species due to its limited availability and specific growing conditions."
