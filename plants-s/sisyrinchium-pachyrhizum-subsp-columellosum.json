    "intro": "Sisyrinchium pachyrhizum subsp. columellosum, commonly known as the broadroot blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence and are pollinated by insects. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in dry, sunny environments."
