    "intro": "Sanicula bipinnata, commonly known as the twin-lobed snakeroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant itself is not widely cultivated. Sanicula bipinnata thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the eastern United States."
