    "intro": "Schnella porphyrotricha var. smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's moss, is a variant of the porphyrotricha species belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows on soil or rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The plant features dense, cushion-like growth with dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a layer of tiny, translucent cells. Its sporophytes are usually short and stout, with a capsule that is urn-shaped and covered in a thick, reddish cuticle. This variety is notable for its distinctive coloration and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
