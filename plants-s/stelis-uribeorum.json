    "intro": "Stelis uribeorum, commonly known as the Uribeo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil. Stelis uribeorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
