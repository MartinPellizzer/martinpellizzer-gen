    "intro": "Solidago puberula var. borealis, commonly known as the northern goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and bogs. The plant features upright, branched stems covered with fine, soft hairs. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also hairy, contributing to its characteristic appearance. The flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn, are golden-yellow and arranged in panicle-like clusters, making it a valuable nectar source for pollinators."
