    "intro": "Sium bulbosum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, carrot-like roots and compound leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along stream banks. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays an important ecological role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
