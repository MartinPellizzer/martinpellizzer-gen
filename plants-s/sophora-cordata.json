    "intro": "Sophora cordata, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pendulous clusters of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Sophora cordata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
