    "intro": "Santalodes dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and ecological research. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List."
