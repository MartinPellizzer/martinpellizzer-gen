    "intro": "Solanum tauschii, commonly known as the Syrian nightshade, is a wild relative of the tomato and potato. It is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and Central Asia. The plant produces small, purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It has hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Solanum tauschii is valued in plant breeding programs for its genetic diversity and potential to improve crop resilience."
