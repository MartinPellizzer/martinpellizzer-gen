    "intro": "Salix pseudokoreensis, commonly known as the Korean weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green on top and pale white underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
