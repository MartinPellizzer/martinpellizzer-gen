    "intro": "Steffensia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky soils along cliffs and sea walls, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable species in coastal botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Steffensia scopulorum is considered a species of conservation concern."
