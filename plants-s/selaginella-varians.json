    "intro": "Selaginella varians, commonly known as the variable spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, and it exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, a trait known as resurrection plant behavior. Its reproductive structures are typically arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its ecological significance in nutrient cycling. Selaginella varians plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
