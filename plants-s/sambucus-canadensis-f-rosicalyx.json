    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis f. rosicalyx, commonly known as the rose-leaf elderberry, is a variant of the common elderberry. It is characterized by its distinctive rose-colored leaves that are tinged with red or pink hues, setting it apart from the typical green foliage of the species. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, woodland environments. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
