It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and striking color contrast make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker floral hues compared to other sedum varieties."
