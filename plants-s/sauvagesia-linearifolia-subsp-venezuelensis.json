    "intro": "Sauvagesia linearifolia subsp. venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan narrow-leaved sauvagesia, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Venezuela. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, typically found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
