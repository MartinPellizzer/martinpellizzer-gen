    "intro": "Silene meruensis, commonly known as the Meru catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged alternately along the stem. Silene meruensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
