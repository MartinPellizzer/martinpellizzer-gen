    "intro": "Schilleria lentaginoides, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small herbaceous plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Schilleria lentaginoides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
