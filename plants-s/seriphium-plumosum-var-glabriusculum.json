    "intro": "Seriphium plumosum var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the prairie thistle, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in restoration projects due to its ecological value."
