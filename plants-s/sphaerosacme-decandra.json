It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
