    "intro": "Syzygium cheesmaniae, commonly known as the cheese mango, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to yellow-orange fruits with a distinctive, bumpy rind. The fruit is known for its sweet, creamy flesh and is often used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
