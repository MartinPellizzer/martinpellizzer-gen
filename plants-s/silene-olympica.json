    "intro": "Silene olympica, commonly known as the Olympic campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branched and upright. Silene olympica is a symbol of the Olympic Games and is protected in its natural habitat due to its limited distribution."
