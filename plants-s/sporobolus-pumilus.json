    "intro": "Sporobolus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and riparian zones. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Sporobolus pumilus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its wetland environment."
