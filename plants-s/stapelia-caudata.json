    "intro": "Stapelia caudata, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that resemble a scorpion's tail, which are pollinated by flies. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Stapelia caudata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
