It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. It produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Senegalia oaxacana is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of wood and forage."
