    "intro": "Staphylea geniculata, commonly known as the climbing spindle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb by means of tendrils, forming dense, tangled growth. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Staphylea geniculata thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in woodland habitats."
