    "intro": "Silene waldsteinii f. media, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against harsh environmental conditions. Silene waldsteinii f. media is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
