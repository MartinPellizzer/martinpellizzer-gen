    "intro": "Stenogyne sessilis var. wailukuensis, commonly known as the Wailuku rock nettle, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It is adapted to grow in rocky or coastal habitats, often found in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
