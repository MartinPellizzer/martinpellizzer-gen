    "intro": "Sulcorebutia inflexiseta, commonly known as the snowball cactus, is a species of succulent native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Sulcorebutia inflexiseta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
