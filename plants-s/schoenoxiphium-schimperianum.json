    "intro": "Schoenoxiphium schimperianum, commonly known as the Schimper's golden gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
