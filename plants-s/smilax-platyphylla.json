    "intro": "Smilax platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and climbing habit, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Smilax platyphylla is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
