    "intro": "Salacia acreana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Sterculiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to reddish pods containing several seeds. Salacia acreana is known for its rapid growth and is often considered an invasive species in regions where it is introduced. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge in agricultural settings."
