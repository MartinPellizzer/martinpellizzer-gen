    "intro": "Stellaria longipes subsp. stricta, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, branching stems and small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed ground. This subspecies is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other members of the species."
