    "intro": "Sterculia colorata, commonly known as the red sterculia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a tuft of silky hair. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
