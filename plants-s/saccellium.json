    "intro": "Saccellium, commonly known as the bladder nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its large, fleshy, bladder-like fruits that encase its seeds. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical features of Saccellium make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
