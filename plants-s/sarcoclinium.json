    "intro": "Sarcoclinium, commonly known as the evergreen heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plants are shrubs with small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Sarcoclinium species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. They play a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects that pollinate their flowers."
