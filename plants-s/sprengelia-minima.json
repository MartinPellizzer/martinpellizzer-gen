    "intro": "Sprengelia minima, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spike, often resembling spider-like structures. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
