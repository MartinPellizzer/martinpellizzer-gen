    "intro": "Sparganium simplex subsp. emersum, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in Europe and parts of Asia. It features submerged and emergent stems with whorled leaves that form dense, floating clusters on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
