    "intro": "Synsepalum laurentii, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits with a star-shaped calyx. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a sweet, sometimes tangy flavor, while the seeds are often used in traditional medicine. It is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary and medicinal uses."
