It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with striking blue or purple hues, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, granular texture, giving it its common name. Scelochilus granizoi is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
