    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus var. fertilis, commonly known as the Indian sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This variant is particularly notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in preventing erosion in sandy landscapes."
