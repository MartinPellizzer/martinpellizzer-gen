    "intro": "Schizachyrium tenerum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a clumping growth habit. Schizachyrium tenerum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
