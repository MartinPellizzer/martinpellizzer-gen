    "intro": "Salvia adenophylla, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and striking violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia adenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
