    "intro": "Sorghum trichopus, commonly known as the slender sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, tropical or subtropical regions and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often pink or purplish in color. It is characterized by its fibrous stalks and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other sorghum species."
