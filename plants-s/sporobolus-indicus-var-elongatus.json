It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often reddish in color and contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically found in wetland or marshy environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to moist, often saline conditions."
