It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in permafrost conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats that provide habitat for various arctic flora and fauna."
