    "intro": "Smilacina japonica subsp. hirta, commonly known as Japanese climbing smilacina, is a perennial vine native to East Asia. It features long, slender stems that climb using tendrils, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
