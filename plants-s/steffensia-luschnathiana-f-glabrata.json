It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant is notable for its smooth, hairless foliage, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
