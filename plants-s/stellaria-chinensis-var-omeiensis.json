It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution."
