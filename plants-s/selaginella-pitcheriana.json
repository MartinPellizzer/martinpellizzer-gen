    "intro": "Selaginella pitcheriana, commonly known as the Pitcher's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, spiky leaves and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. This plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing structures. Selaginella pitcheriana is also notable for its ability to reproduce through spores, a feature common to many mosses and ferns. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat destruction and limited geographic distribution."
