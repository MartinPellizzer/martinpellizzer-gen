    "intro": "Scirpus juncoides var. hotarui, commonly known as the Hotarui bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands in marshy areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it an important species in stabilizing wetland soils. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological role in nutrient cycling."
