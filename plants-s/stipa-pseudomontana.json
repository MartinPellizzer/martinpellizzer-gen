    "intro": "Stipa pseudomontana, commonly known as the mountain false oat, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Stipa pseudomontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and sandy soils."
