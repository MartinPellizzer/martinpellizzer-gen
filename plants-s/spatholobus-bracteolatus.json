    "intro": "Spatholobus bracteolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, making it visually distinct. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Spatholobus bracteolatus is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
