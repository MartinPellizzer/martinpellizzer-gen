    "intro": "Setaria interrupta, commonly known as the common dogstail grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and cylindrical, hair-like inflorescences that resemble a dog's tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Setaria interrupta is a hardy plant that is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
