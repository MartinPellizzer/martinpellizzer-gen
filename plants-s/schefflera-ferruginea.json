    "intro": "Schefflera ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and dark green, glossy leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or rusty hue on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera ferruginea is relatively low maintenance and can be grown in containers or as part of a garden landscape."
