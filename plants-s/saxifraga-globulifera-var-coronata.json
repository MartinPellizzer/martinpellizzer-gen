    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. coronata, commonly known as the crown saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in harsh climates. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in a crown-like arrangement, giving it its common name. Saxifraga globulifera var. coronata is well adapted to extreme environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
