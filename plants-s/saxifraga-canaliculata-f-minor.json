    "intro": "Saxifraga canaliculata f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features rosettes of dark green, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
