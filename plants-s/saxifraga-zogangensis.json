    "intro": "Saxifraga zogangensis, commonly known as the Zogang saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. Saxifraga zogangensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
