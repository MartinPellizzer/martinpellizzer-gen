    "intro": "Stereospermum xylocarpum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense, hard wood. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
