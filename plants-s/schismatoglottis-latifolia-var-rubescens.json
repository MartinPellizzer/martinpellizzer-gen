    "intro": "Schismatoglottis latifolia var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered schismatoglottis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves and striking red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
