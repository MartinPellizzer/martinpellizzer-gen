    "intro": "Sarcomelicope simplicifolia subsp. neoscotica, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows on the branches of other trees, such as the \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba lehua, and derives some of its nutrients from its host. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
