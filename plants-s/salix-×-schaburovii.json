    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 schaburovii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and tundra environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in colder regions for landscaping purposes."
