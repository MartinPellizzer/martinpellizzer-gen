    "intro": "Salix rugosa var. androgyna, commonly known as the male female willow, is a unique variant of the weeping willow that exhibits both male and female flowers on the same plant. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its long, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the male flowers producing pollen and the female flowers developing into willow fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
