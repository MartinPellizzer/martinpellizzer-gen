    "intro": "Sutera tristis, commonly known as the weeping sedum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces showy yellow-orange blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sutera tristis is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
