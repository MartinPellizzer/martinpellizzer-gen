    "intro": "Sorghum muticum, commonly known as marsh sorghum, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green or pale in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
