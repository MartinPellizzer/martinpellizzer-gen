    "intro": "Sophora occidentalis, commonly known as the Western false indigo, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
