    "intro": "Salix alba, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers. White willow is known for its medicinal properties, as it contains salicin, a compound related to aspirin."
