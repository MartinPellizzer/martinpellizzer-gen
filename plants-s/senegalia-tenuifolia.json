    "intro": "Senegalia tenuifolia, commonly known as screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Senegalia tenuifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
