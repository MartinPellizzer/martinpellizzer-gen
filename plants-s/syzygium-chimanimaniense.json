It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which is characterized by aromatic leaves and flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are consumed by various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
