It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems and opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage and fruit."
