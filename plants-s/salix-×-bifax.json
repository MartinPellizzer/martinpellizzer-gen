    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 bifax, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix viminalis (osier dogwood), resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollen dispersal. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
