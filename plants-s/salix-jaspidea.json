    "intro": "Salix jaspidea, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. Its bark is smooth and often has a distinctive yellowish or reddish hue, which contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat."
