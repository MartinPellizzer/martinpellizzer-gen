    "intro": "Silphium chickamaugense, commonly known as the Chickamaugue silphium, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetland habitats. It was historically significant to indigenous peoples and early European settlers for its medicinal and culinary uses. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in several states."
