    "intro": "Saussurea bracteata, commonly known as the Tibetan saffron or the Himalayan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in a composite head, which is a common feature among members of its family. Saussurea bracteata is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its medicinal properties have also been studied, though it is not as widely used as other saffron species."
