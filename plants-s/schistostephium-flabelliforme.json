It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
