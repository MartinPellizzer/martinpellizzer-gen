    "intro": "Sclerostachya milroyi, commonly known as the Milroy's screwtree, is a rare and unique species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, deciduous tree characterized by its twisted, spiraling branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sclerostachya milroyi is considered a conservation concern."
