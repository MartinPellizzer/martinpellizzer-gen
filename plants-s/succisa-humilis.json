    "intro": "Succisa humilis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are hairy and often clustered at the base of the plant. The flowers are tiny, white or pink, and arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens, along paths, and in woodland areas. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners, making it both a common weed and a resilient ground cover."
