    "intro": "Schizoglossum hollandiae, commonly known as the Dutch lily, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Native to the Netherlands, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
