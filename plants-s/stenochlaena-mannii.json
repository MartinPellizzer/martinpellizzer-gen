    "intro": "Stenochlaena mannii, commonly known as the African marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Stenochlaena mannii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
