    "intro": "Schizocarpum, commonly known as the \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique botanical feature of producing schizocarps, which are fruits that split into two or more parts upon maturity. These plants typically have basal leaves that are alternate or opposite in arrangement. Schizocarpum species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
