    "intro": "Stelis picea, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis picea is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
