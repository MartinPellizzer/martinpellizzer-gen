    "intro": "Schefflera oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter, with elongated, oval-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera oblongifolia is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
