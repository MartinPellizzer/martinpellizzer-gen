    "intro": "Sedum septangulare, commonly known as the seven-angled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically arranged in a whorled pattern and have a slightly rough texture. Sedum septangulare is well adapted to poor soil conditions and full sun exposure."
