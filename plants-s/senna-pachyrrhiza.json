    "intro": "Senna pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-leaf senna, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often thick and leathery to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typical of the Fabaceae family, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Senna pachyrrhiza has deep roots that allow it to access groundwater, making it a resilient species in dry climates. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
