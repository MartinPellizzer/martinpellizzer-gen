    "intro": "Senecio lithophilus, commonly known as the stone-loving groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Senecio lithophilus is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
