    "intro": "Sarcotoxicum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaved poison ivy, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its sap contains toxic compounds that can cause skin irritation. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both humans and livestock."
