It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its branching, scale-like leaves that resemble moss. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella alampeta is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures called strobila. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
