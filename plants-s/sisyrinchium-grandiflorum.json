    "intro": "Sisyrinchium grandiflorum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, three-lobed seed capsules that release seeds through a mechanism involving elaiosomes, which attract ants for dispersal. Sisyrinchium grandiflorum is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
