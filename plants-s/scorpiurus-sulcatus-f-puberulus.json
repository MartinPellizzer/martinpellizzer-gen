    "intro": "Scorpiurus sulcatus f. puberulus, commonly known as the pubescent sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. The plant features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. Its flowers are typically small, white or pale blue, and are clustered in dense, umbelliform inflorescences. This succulent is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its leaves."
