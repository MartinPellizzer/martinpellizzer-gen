    "intro": "Schefflera dissidens, commonly known as the fragrant schefflera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to pets. Schefflera dissidens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
