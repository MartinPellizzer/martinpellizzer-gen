    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia subsp. hegetschweileri, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, which contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
