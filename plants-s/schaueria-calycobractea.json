    "intro": "Schaueria calycobractea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are surrounded by modified leaves called calycobracts. Schaueria calycobractea is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and horticulture."
