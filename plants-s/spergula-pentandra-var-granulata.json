    "intro": "Spergula pentandra var. granulata, commonly known as granulate false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The variety granulata is characterized by its finely granular texture on the leaf surface, which sets it apart from other varieties of Spergula pentandra."
