    "intro": "Spergula norvegica, commonly known as Norwegian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale green to white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Spergula norvegica is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
