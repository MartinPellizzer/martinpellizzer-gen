    "intro": "Sphondylium vulgare var. laciniatum, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, often with a distinctive white or yellowish spot near the base of each leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed soils."
