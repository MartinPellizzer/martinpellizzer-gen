    "intro": "Stegastrum beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along water edges. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment."
