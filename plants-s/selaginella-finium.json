    "intro": "Selaginella finium, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in cone-like structures called strobila. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Selaginella finium is a perennial herb that exhibits a unique ability to survive in low-light conditions. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
