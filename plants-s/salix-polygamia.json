    "intro": "Salix polygamia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and long, drooping catkins that produce yellowish pollen. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. Salix polygamia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species."
