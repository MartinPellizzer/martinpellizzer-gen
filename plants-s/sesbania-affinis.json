    "intro": "Sesbania affinis, commonly known as the small-leaved sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically small and alternate along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Sesbania affinis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
