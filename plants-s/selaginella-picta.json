    "intro": "Selaginella picta, commonly known as the painted spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that often display intricate patterns. Selaginella picta is known for its ability to survive in poor soil conditions and can tolerate periods of drought due to its specialized root system. It is also notable for its spore-producing structures, which are borne on specialized leaves called sporophylls."
