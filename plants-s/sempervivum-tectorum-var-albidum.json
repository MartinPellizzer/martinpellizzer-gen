    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. albidum, commonly known as the Alba Hens and Chicks, is a succulent plant native to the Alps. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it an excellent addition to xeriscapes."
