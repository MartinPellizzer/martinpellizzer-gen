    "intro": "Spartium tridens, commonly known as thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, spiny pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Spartium tridens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
