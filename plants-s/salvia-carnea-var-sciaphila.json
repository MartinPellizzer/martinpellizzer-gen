It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. The plant features lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its flowers are typically violet to purple, arranged in whorled clusters. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens with shaded conditions."
