    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 polessiae, commonly known as the Weeping Willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern Europe. It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, cascading branches that create a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
