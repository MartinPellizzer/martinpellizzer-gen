    "intro": "Salix kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Tibet. This deciduous shrub or small tree typically grows at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its slender branches and narrow leaves are adapted to withstand cold and strong winds. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
