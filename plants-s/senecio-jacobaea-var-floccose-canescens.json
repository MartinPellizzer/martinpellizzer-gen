    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea var. floccose-canescens, commonly known as the clouded ragwort, is a variant of the common ragwort, characterized by its fluffy, woolly appearance on the stems and leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, ribbed seed capsules. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the entire plant contains toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. This variant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
