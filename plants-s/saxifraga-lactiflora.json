    "intro": "Saxifraga lactiflora, commonly known as the milk-plant saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapting to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra habitats. Saxifraga lactiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems of cold climates."
