    "intro": "Saccocalyx follicularis, commonly known as the sac-like follicle plant, is a flowering plant characterized by its unique saccate (sac-like) follicles that enclose its seeds. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in warm climates. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with the distinctive sac-like structure developing from the ovary after pollination. The follicles open to release seeds, often through a mechanism involving dehiscence."
