    "intro": "Saracha amphitricha, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Saracha amphitricha is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
