    "intro": "Schizoloma ensifolium var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble a sword, typically reaching lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins and a glossy, dark green appearance. This variant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
