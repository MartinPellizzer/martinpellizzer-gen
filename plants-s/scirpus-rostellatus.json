    "intro": "Scirpus rostellatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus rostellatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and filtering water."
