    "intro": "Symphytum album, commonly known as white comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall spikes of white to pale purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rich in allantoin, a compound known for its soothing properties. Symphytum album is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along streambanks."
