    "intro": "Scirpus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stem, typically in late summer. Its rhizomes are thick and capable of extensive underground growth, allowing it to form dense colonies. Scirpus orientalis plays a crucial role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
