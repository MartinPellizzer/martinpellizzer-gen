    "intro": "Silene cariensis, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Silene cariensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
