    "intro": "Siparuna alternifolia, commonly known as the pink trumpet tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking pink or red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
