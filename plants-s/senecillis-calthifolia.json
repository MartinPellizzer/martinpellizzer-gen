    "intro": "Senecillis calthifolia, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Senecillis calthifolia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
