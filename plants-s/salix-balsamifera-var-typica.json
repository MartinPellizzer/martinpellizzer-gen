    "intro": "Salix balsamifera var. typica, commonly known as the balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic resins adds to its ecological and cultural significance."
