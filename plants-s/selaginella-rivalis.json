    "intro": "Selaginella rivalis, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in various parts of the world. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or forested soils. The plant has a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions, including drought and shade, due to its specialized water-storing tissues. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores. Selaginella rivalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
