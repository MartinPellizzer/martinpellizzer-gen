    "intro": "Solanum cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to China. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, lobed leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
