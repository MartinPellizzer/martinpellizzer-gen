    "intro": "Solenangis defoliata, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green, strap-like bracts. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native habitat."
