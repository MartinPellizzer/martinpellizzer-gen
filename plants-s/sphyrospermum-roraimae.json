    "intro": "Sphyrospermum roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima sphaerocarp, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical, fleshy fruit that resembles a small, rounded orb. The plant belongs to the family Sphaerocarpaceae, which includes only a few species worldwide. Its growth is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils and high-altitude conditions of the tepuis. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered an endangered species."
