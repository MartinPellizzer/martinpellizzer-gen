    "intro": "Scutellaria koelzii, commonly known as Koelz's blue skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
