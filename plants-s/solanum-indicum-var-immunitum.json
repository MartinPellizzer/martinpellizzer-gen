    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. immunitum, commonly known as the Indian nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or red when mature, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
