    "intro": "Soehrensia formosa var. polycephala, commonly known as the golden star hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange bracts that resemble stars, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant foliage and showy inflorescences."
