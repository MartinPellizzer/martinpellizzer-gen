    "intro": "Salix reticulata var. nivalis, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white\u7ed2\u6bdb (downy hair). The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, green fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, or wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
