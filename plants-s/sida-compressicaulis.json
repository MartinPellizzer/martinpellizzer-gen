    "intro": "Sida compressicaulis, commonly known as narrowleaf sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and streambanks. The plant has alternate, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue or white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces fluffy, white to grayish seedpods that disperse seeds by wind. Sida compressicaulis is often found in wetland ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in saturated soils."
