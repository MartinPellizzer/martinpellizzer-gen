    "intro": "Stellilabium barbozae, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped labellum, which is a specialized petal structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its botanical features include delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, and it has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
