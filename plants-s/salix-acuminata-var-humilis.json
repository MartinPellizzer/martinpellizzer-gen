    "intro": "Salix acuminata var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates and birds."
