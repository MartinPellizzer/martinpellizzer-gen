    "intro": "Solenogyne emphysopus, commonly known as the bladderleaf, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often inflated, resembling bladders, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Solenogyne emphysopus is often found in open grasslands and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
