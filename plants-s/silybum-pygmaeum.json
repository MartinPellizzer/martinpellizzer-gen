It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to yellow flowers. The plant contains a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature, and its seeds are often used in traditional medicine. Silybum pygmaeum thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. It is closely related to the more well-known Silybum marianum, also known as milk thistle."
