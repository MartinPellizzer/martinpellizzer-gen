It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it has a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used historically in traditional medicine. Styrax obovatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
