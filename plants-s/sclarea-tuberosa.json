    "intro": "Sclarea tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous angelica, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Sclarea tuberosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
