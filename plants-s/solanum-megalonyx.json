    "intro": "Solanum megalonyx, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids. Solanum megalonyx thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
