    "intro": "Sindora supa, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, Sindora supa is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
