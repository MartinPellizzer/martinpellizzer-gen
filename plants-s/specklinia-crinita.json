    "intro": "Specklinia crinita, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense layer of root hairs. Specklinia crinita is well adapted to humid environments and thrives in shaded, moist conditions."
