    "intro": "Salix grisonensis, commonly known as the Grison willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. Salix grisonensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
