    "intro": "Sida xanti, commonly known as desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Sida xanti is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
