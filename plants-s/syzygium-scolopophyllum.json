    "intro": "Syzygium scolopophyllum, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Hawaii, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-like canopy and smooth, gray bark. Its fragrant white flowers are followed by edible, fleshy berries that attract various bird species. Syzygium scolopophyllum plays a vital ecological role in Hawaiian ecosystems and is also culturally significant to the native Hawaiian people."
