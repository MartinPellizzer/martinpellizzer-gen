    "intro": "Schivereckia doerfleri, commonly known as the Doerfler's schivereckia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
