    "intro": "Saxifraga heteroclada, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a single umbel at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Saxifraga heteroclada is often found growing in crevices or on slopes, where it can withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
