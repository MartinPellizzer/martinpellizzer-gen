    "intro": "Smilax laevis var. parkii, commonly known as the smooth smilax or park's smilax, is a variant of the smooth smilax species native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its smooth, waxy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that eventually develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
