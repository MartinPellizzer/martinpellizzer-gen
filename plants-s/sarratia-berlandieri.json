    "intro": "Sarratia berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its pale pink or white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
