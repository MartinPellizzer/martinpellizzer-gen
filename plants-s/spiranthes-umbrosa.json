    "intro": "Spiranthes umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are grass-like and form a dense basal rosette. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
