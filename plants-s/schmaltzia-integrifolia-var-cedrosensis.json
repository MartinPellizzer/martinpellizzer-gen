It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has palmate leaves with a rough texture and a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
