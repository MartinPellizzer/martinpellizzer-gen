    "intro": "Schomburgkia chionodora var. kimballiana, commonly known as the Kimball's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost ghostly white petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, slender stem with few leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
