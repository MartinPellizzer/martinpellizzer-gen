    "intro": "Saxifraga juniperifolia subsp. sancta, commonly known as the sacred saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in small, rounded leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is notable for its resilience in harsh environments and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental value."
