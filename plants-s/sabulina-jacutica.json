    "intro": "Sabulina jacutica, commonly known as the sandy bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, exposed habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, usually blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments. Sabulina jacutica is an important component of alpine flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
