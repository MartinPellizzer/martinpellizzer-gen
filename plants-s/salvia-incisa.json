    "intro": "Salvia incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia incisa is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
