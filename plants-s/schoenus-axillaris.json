    "intro": "Schoenus axillaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clumps, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its wetland environment. Schoenus axillaris plays a role in maintaining ecosystem balance by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
