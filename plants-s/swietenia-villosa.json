    "intro": "Swietenia villosa, commonly known as the hairy mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and large, compound leaves that are typically feather-like in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Swietenia villosa is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
