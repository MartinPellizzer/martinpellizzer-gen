    "intro": "Sphacele mutica, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the surface. Its leaves are thin and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Sphacele mutica plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an interesting example of a carnivorous plant."
