    "intro": "Salix cistoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix cistoides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
