    "intro": "Senecio commutatus var. ovatus, commonly known as the woolly yellowstar, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in showy, star-shaped inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert and sagebrush environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in its native range."
