    "intro": "Scirpus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-cornered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. Scirpus tetragonus typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
