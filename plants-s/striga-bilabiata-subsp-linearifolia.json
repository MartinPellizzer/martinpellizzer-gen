    "intro": "Striga bilabiata subsp. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale yellow, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the host plant's growth, with seed germination often triggered by chemical signals released by the host. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed of economic importance in regions where it infests crops."
