    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum herthae, commonly known as the Herth's ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in high humidity and cool, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum herthae is considered a vulnerable species."
