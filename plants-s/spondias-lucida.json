    "intro": "Spondias lucida, commonly known as the shining star apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, green fruits with a sweet, acidic flavor. The fruit's skin is thin and edible, while the pulp contains several small, hard seeds. Spondias lucida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in home gardens."
