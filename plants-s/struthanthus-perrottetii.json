    "intro": "Struthanthus perrottetii, commonly known as the desert four-o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, four-petaled flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant blooms from spring to early summer, producing vibrant yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
