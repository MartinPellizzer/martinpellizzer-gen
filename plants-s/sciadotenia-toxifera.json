    "intro": "Sciadotenia toxifera, commonly known as the toxic sciadotenia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruits are small, round, and contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. Due to its toxic properties, the plant is not commonly cultivated and is more often found in the wild."
