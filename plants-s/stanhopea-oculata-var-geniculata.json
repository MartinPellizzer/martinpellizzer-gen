    "intro": "Stanhopea oculata var. geniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of flowers, with each bloom featuring a distinctive, spurred lip. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively manageable care requirements."
