    "intro": "Salvia leuconeura, commonly known as the white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, tubular, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its aromatic leaves release a pleasant scent when crushed, and it is often used in traditional herbal practices. Salvia leuconeura is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
