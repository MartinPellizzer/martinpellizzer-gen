It typically grows up to 15 meters in height and has a slender trunk covered with persistent leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a crown at the top of the trunk. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that is often consumed by birds and other animals. Syagrus yatay is valued for its ornamental appearance and is also used in traditional medicine."
