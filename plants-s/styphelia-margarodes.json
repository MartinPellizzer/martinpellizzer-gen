    "intro": "Styphelia margarodes, commonly known as the pink wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Styphelia margarodes thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments like forest understories. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
