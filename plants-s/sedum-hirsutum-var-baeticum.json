    "intro": "Sedum hirsutum var. baeticum, commonly known as the Alboran sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it withstands strong sunlight and limited water availability. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure."
