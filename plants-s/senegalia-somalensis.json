    "intro": "Senegalia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its wood is durable and has been used traditionally for construction and fuel. Senegalia somalensis also plays a role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local wildlife."
