    "intro": "Salix reflexiflora, commonly known as the reflexed willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups and often have a reddish or brownish hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
