    "intro": "Strychnos puberula, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported medicinal properties. However, like many members of its genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with caution."
