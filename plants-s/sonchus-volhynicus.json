    "intro": "Sonchus volhynicus, commonly known as Volhynian sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
