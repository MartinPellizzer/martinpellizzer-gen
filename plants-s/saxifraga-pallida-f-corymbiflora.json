    "intro": "Saxifraga pallida f. corymbiflora, commonly known as the pale saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in early summer, often arranged in compact corymbs. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces where it can access limited soil. Its botanical structure is adapted to cold climates, making it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
