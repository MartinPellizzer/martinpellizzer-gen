    "intro": "Salsola microkali, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are small, succulent, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Salsola microkali is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
