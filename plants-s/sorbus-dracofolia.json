    "intro": "Sorbus dracofolia, commonly known as the dragon's foot or dragon's blood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
