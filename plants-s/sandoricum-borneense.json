    "intro": "Sandoricum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean sandoricum, is a tropical shrub native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other economically important trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, lowland forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
