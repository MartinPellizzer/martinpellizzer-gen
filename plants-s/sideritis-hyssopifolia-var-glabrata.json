    "intro": "Sideritis hyssopifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as smooth-haired sainfoin, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, though the 'glabrata' variety has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
