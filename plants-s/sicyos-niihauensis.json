    "intro": "Sicyos niihauensis, commonly known as the Niihau bottle gourd, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian island of Niihau. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bottle-shaped fruits. It thrives in dry, coastal environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
