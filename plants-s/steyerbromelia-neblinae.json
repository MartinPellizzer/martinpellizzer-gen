    "intro": "Steyerbromelia neblinae, commonly known as the misty bromeliad, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention and provide protection against herbivores. Steyerbromelia neblinae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its native habitat."
