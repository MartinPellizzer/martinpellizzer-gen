    "intro": "Sarcostemma refractum, commonly known as the brittle milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are typically opposite and ovate in shape. Sarcostemma refractum is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
