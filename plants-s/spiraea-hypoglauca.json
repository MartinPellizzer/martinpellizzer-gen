    "intro": "Spiraea hypoglauca, commonly known as the white meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, arching stems covered in small, oval leaves. The plant is characterized by its clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often pubescent, with a silvery or pale green underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Spiraea hypoglauca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows."
