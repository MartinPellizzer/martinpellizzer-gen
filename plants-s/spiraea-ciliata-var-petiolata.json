It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with finely toothed margins and hairy undersides. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
