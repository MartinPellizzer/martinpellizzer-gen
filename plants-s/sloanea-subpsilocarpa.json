    "intro": "Sloanea subpsilocarpa, commonly known as the psychedelic sloanea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It is notable for containing psychoactive compounds, particularly tryptamines, which have been of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research. Due to its potential effects, it is also a subject of conservation and legal interest in many regions."
