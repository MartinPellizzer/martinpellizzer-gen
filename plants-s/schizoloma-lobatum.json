    "intro": "Schizoloma lobatum, commonly known as the lobed leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed thallus, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate and subtropical regions. Schizoloma lobatum is known for its slow growth and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality and environmental changes."
