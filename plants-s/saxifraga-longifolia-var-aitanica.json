    "intro": "Saxifraga longifolia var. aitanica, commonly known as the Aitanica saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
