    "intro": "Siphocampylus baracoensis, commonly known as the Baracoa bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to Cuba. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
