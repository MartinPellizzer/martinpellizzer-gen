    "intro": "Seseli crassifolium, commonly known as broadleaf seseli, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that bears small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, dry environments. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse seeds via the wind. Seseli crassifolium is often found in open habitats such as slopes and wastelands."
