    "intro": "Stenostomum urbanianum, commonly known as the narrow-mouthed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often form a rosette and its ability to trap small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. The plant is typically found in wetlands and marshy areas where it can thrive in nutrient-poor water environments. Its flowers are usually small and borne in clusters, with distinctive blue or purple petals. Stenostomum urbanianum plays a unique ecological role by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation, making it an important component of its wetland habitat."
