    "intro": "Sporobolus mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mascarene Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
