    "intro": "Schizophyllum, commonly known as the wood spleen or the split skin mushroom, is a genus of fungi in the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its unique, irregularly branched fruiting bodies that often resemble a brain or a sponge. The caps are typically small and convex, with a fibrous, leathery texture. Schizophyllum species are saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and other organic matter. They play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems."
