    "intro": "Synotis guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou synotis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Guizhou Province in China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are slender and often branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Synotis guizhouensis is considered an endangered species."
