    "intro": "Scirpus californicus var. spoliatus, commonly known as the California bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to six feet, often growing in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in marshy areas, pond edges, and other wet environments, playing a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
