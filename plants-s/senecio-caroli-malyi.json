    "intro": "Senecio caroli-malyi, commonly known as the Caroli-Malyi groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
