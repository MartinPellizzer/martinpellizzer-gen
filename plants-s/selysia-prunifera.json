    "intro": "Selysia prunifera, commonly known as the cherry-leaf lycaenid, is a small butterfly species belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is characterized by its delicate, iridescent wings that display a range of colors, including blues, purples, and metallic greens. The larvae of this species feed on the leaves of cherry and related plants, making it closely associated with these host plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal growth of its host plants, which influences its distribution and abundance. The butterfly is often found in temperate regions where its preferred vegetation is present."
