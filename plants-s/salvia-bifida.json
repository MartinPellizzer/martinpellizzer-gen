    "intro": "Salvia bifida, commonly known as the divided sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Salvia bifida thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. It is also valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
