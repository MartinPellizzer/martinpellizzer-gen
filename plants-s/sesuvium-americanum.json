    "intro": "Sesuvium americanum, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in salty or brackish environments, often found along shorelines and in tidal marshes. The plant has prostrate growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in the morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sesuvium americanum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
