    "intro": "Strobilanthes cerinthoides var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy strobilanthes, is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and produces striking, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest undergrowth, thriving in humid tropical climates. Its flowering period usually occurs during the monsoon season, and it is often found in the understory of lowland rainforests. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a notably fuzzy appearance."
