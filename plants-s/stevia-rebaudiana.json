    "intro": "Stevia rebaudiana, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for containing steviol glycosides, which are natural, non-caloric sweeteners. Its leaves are harvested and processed to extract these compounds, making it a popular alternative to sugar. Stevia rebaudiana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes."
