    "intro": "Saxifraga poluniniana var. poluniniana, commonly known as the Polunin's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
