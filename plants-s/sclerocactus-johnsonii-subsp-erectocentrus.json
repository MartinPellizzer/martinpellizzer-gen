    "intro": "Sclerocactus johnsonii subsp. erectocentrus, commonly known as the Johnson's spineless cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, white spines that are less pronounced than those of other cholla species. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists."
