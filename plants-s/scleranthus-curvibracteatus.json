    "intro": "Scleranthus curvibracteatus, commonly known as the bent-bract scleranth, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and has a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. Scleranthus curvibracteatus has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often considered a weed but has been studied for its ecological roles in certain habitats."
