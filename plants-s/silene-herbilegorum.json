    "intro": "Silene herbilegorum, commonly known as the lesser catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched.
