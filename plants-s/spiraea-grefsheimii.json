    "intro": "Spiraea grefsheimii, commonly known as the Grefsheim spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and compact form, which make it suitable for borders or as a specimen plant."
