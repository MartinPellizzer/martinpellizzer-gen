    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. saturejifolia, commonly known as the red-jointed whitebeam, is a variant of the European whitebeam. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red, woody joints on its stems, which give it its common name. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in spring. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer and is an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
