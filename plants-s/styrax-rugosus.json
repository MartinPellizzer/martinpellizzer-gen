It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during early spring. The plant produces dark red, waxy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly rough texture. Styrax rugosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
