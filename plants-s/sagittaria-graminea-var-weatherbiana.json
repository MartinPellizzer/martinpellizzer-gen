    "intro": "Sagittaria graminea var. weatherbiana, commonly known as the weatherbiana arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender stems that often root in shallow water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, typically rising above the water on slender stalks. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
