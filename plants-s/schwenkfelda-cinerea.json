    "intro": "Schwenkfelda cinerea, commonly known as the pale green orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, unbranched stem and a single, pale green to white flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Schwenkfelda cinerea is known for its delicate appearance and is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
