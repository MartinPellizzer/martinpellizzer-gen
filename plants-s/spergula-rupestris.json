    "intro": "Spergula rupestris, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Spergula rupestris is adapted to well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil in rocky areas and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
