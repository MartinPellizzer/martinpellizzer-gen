    "intro": "Salix flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Salix flagellaris is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
