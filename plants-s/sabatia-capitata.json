    "intro": "Sabatia capitata, commonly known as the clustered pink, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in dense, clustered inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance and help in water conservation. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and roadside ditches. Sabatia capitata plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
