    "intro": "Stapelia simsii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often spiny stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, resembling a ghostly face, hence its common name. These flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a dramatic visual element to the plant. Stapelia simsii is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts due to its low maintenance and eye-catching appearance."
