It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum chariense is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
