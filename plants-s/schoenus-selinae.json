    "intro": "Schoenus selinae, commonly known as the silver grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue foliage. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its narrow, blade-like leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost\u7ed2-like appearance. Schoenus selinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
