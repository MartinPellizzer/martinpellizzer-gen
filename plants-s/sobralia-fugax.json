    "intro": "Sobralia fugax, commonly known as the fleeting sobralia, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink, red, and orange. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its short blooming period, it is often referred to as \"fugax,\" meaning \"fleeting\" in Latin."
