    "intro": "Solanum subexarmatum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability."
