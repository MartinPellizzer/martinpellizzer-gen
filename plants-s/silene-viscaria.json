    "intro": "Silene viscaria, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive sticky hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Silene viscaria is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
