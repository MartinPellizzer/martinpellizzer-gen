It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
