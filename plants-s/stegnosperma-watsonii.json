    "intro": "Stegnosperma watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's stegnosperma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
