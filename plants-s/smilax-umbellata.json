    "intro": "Smilax umbellata, commonly known as the fragrant smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and tendrils that allow it to climb and entangle other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. Its berries are red or black and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Smilax umbellata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks."
