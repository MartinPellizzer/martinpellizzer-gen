    "intro": "Stellaria thymifolia, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Stellaria thymifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
