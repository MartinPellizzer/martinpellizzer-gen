    "intro": "Striga chloroleuca, commonly known as the white witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically targeting crops like sorghum and millet. Its life cycle involves producing small, white, egg-like structures called pseudogynidia, which are dispersed by wind or water. The plant's root system forms haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system, causing significant yield loss. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a major agricultural pest in sub-Saharan Africa."
