    "intro": "Salacia callensii, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a fiery appearance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy surface. Salacia callensii is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties, though its botanical study remains limited."
