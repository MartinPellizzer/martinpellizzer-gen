    "intro": "Sorghum setifolium, commonly known as needlegrass, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Sorghum setifolium is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
