It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive wavy or crenate margin, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
