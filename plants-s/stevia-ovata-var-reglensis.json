It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is well-known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Its leaves are typically harvested and processed for use in food and beverages as a low-calorie sweetener alternative. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both commercial and ornamental purposes."
