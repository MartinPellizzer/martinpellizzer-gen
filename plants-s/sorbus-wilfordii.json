    "intro": "Sorbus wilfordii, commonly known as the Chinese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in mountainous regions. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
