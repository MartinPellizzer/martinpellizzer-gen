    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 arikae, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a hybrid species native to the northwestern United States and southern Canada. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, often riparian environments. The plant features slender, often multi-stemmed branches and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures."
