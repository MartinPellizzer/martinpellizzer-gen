    "intro": "Schizaea pusilla, commonly known as the small whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Schizaeaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, tropical environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, unbranched stem and a crown of delicate, spiral-shaped fronds. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, fleshy structures called sporophylls. Schizaea pusilla plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
