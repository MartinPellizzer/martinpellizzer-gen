    "intro": "Sedum glaucum var. bithynicum, commonly known as the Bithynian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Turkey and parts of the Balkans. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8."
