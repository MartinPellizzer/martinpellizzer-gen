    "intro": "Sciaphila nana, commonly known as the dwarf ghost orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or among leaf litter. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciaphila nana is considered a rare and endangered species."
