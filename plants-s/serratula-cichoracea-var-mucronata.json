    "intro": "Serratula cichoracea var. mucronata, commonly known as the spiked sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and have a serrated margin. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
