    "intro": "Saurauia napaulensis var. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei Saurauia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, often pink or white, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
