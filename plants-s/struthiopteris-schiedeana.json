    "intro": "Struthiopteris schiedeana, commonly known as the giant woodfern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
