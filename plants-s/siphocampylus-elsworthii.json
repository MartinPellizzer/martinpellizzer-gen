    "intro": "Siphocampylus elsworthii, commonly known as the Elsworth's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and clusters of pink to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
