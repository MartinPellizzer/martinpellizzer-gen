    "intro": "Saxifraga sartorii, commonly known as the sartorii saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Saxifraga sartorii is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cold climates."
