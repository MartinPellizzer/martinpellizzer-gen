    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. semitorminalis, commonly known as the partially fructified whitebeam, is a rare horticultural form of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its reduced fruiting habit, where only a portion of the flower buds develop into fruits. This form exhibits a unique combination of the parent species' features, including its white, fuzzy flowers and persistent, oval-shaped leaves. It is typically found in cultivation and is valued for its ornamental appeal and genetic diversity. The plant prefers well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
