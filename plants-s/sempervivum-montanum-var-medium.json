    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum var. medium, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
