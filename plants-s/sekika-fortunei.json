It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like foliage that forms dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated as a ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a specimen plant."
