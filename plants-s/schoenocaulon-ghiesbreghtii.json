    "intro": "Schoenocaulon ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
