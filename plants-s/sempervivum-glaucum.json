    "intro": "Sempervivum glaucum, commonly known as the common houseleek, is a perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating, known as a cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. Sempervivum glaucum is also noted for its ability to thrive in full sun and its historical use in traditional medicine."
