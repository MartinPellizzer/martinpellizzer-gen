    "intro": "Sticherus salinoi, commonly known as the salt marsh sticherus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in saline or brackish environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand high salt concentrations and wind exposure. Sticherus salinoi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
