    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 macrior, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers before the leaves fully develop. Salix \u00d7 macrior thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
