    "intro": "Scleranthus candolleanus var. delortii, commonly known as the Delort's sicklegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of S. candolleanus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments."
