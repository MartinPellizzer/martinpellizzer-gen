    "intro": "Salix velutina, commonly known as the velvet willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
