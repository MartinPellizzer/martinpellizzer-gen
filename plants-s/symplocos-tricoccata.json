    "intro": "Symplocos tricoccata, commonly known as the three-seeded elder, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of three to four. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in traditional medicine. Symplocos tricoccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
