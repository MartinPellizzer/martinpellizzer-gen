It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its salt tolerance makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It is also cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
