    "intro": "Salvia carnosa, commonly known as the wooly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Salvia carnosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
