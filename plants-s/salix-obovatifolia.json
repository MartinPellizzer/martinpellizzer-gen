    "intro": "Salix obovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often grayish-green in color and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix obovatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or eroded areas."
