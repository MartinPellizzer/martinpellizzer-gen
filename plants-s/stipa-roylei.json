    "intro": "Stipa roylei, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense, cylindrical seed heads that are often tinged with purple or pink. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve water. Stipa roylei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
