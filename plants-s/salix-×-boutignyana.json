    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 boutignyana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix triandra (black willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces catkins in early spring, typical of willow species, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
