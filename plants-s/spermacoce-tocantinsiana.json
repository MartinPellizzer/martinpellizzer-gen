It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous tiny seeds. Spermacoce tocantinsiana is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various insects."
