    "intro": "Sonchus maritimus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as sea lettuce, is a coastal plant native to temperate regions. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that thrives in saline and brackish environments. The plant features lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in a cluster at the top of the stem. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils, making it a common sight along shorelines. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas contribute to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
