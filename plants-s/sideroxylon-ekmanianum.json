    "intro": "Sideroxylon ekmanianum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, and the plant produces capsules as its fruit."
