    "intro": "Scirpus corymbosus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It has triangular stems that are typically green or reddish in color, and it produces dense clusters of grass-like leaves. The plant flowers in late summer, forming cylindrical spikelets that are often tinged with brown or purple. Scirpus corymbosus thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
