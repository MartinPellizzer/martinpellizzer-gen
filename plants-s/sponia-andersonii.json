    "intro": "Sponia andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's sponia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Sponia andersonii is notable for its unique leaf structure, which features a spongy texture that aids in water retention. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
