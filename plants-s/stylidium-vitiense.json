    "intro": "Stylidium vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to New Guinea. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble small trigger mechanisms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often prostrate or ascending. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to the plant's scent and structure."
