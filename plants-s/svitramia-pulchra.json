    "intro": "Svitramia pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle native to the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, often metallic green or blue coloration, which serves as a form of aposematic coloration to deter predators. The plant it feeds on, typically various species of plants in the Asteraceae family, provides both food and habitat for the beetle. Its larvae are often found on the undersides of leaves, where they feed on plant tissue. The beetle plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding habits."
