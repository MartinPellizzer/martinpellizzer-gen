    "intro": "Sarcochilus spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fertile fronds that produce spores, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. Sarcochilus spathulatus is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks."
