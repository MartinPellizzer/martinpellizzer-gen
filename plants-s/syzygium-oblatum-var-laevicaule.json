    "intro": "Syzygium oblatum var. laevicaule, commonly known as the smooth-leaf tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
