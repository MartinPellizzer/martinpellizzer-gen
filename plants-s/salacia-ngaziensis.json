    "intro": "Salacia ngaziensis, commonly known as the Ngazi mountain gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the genus Salacia. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a bright orange-red color, attracting various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
