    "intro": "Shorea cinerea, commonly known as white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and smooth, pale to gray bark. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
