    "intro": "Silene macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled catchfly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Silene macropetala is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
