    "intro": "Selaginella squamulosa, commonly known as the clubmoss or thread moss, is a species of spore-producing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella squamulosa is also noted for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
