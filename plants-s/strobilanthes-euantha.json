    "intro": "Strobilanthes euantha, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking purple and red floral bracts that resemble flames. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often mistaken for single blooms due to their compact arrangement. Strobilanthes euantha is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
