    "intro": "Styphelia douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, acidic habitats. It thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal rainforests and mountainous regions. Styphelia douglasii is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native ecosystems."
