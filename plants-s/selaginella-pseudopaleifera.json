    "intro": "Selaginella pseudopaleifera, commonly known as the ancient clubmoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains spores. Native to arid regions of South America, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and exhibits a slow growth rate. The plant's ability to survive extreme environmental conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies. Its fossil record provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants."
