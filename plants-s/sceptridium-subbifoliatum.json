    "intro": "Sceptridium subbifoliatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a small evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Sceptridium subbifoliatum is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
