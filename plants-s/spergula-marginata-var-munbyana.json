    "intro": "Spergula marginata var. munbyana, commonly known as the Munby's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along streambanks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
