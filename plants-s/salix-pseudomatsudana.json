It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches that hang gracefully from the crown. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of wind pollination. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
