    "intro": "Saxifraga aspera, commonly known as the rough saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is a perennial species that is relatively hardy and can tolerate cold temperatures. Saxifraga aspera is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
