    "intro": "Streblocarpus scandens, commonly known as the climbing strobilanthes, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its climbing habit is facilitated by adventitious roots that anchor it to supporting structures. Streblocarpus scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
