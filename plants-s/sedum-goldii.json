    "intro": "Sedum goldii, commonly known as the golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and vibrant floral display make it both ornamental and easy to maintain."
