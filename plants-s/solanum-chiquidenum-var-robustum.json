    "intro": "Solanum chiquidenum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, with a distinctive funnel shape, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
