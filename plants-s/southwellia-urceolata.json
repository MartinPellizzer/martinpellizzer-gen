    "intro": "Southwellia urceolata, commonly known as the cup-shaped fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like fronds that form a dense, rosette-shaped structure. The plant is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. Its small, delicate fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, with a soft, velvety texture. Southwellia urceolata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests."
