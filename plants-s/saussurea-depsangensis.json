    "intro": "Saussurea depsangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow to orange flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional Tibetan medicine, where it is used for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
