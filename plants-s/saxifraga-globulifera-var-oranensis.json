    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. oranensis, commonly known as the Canary Island saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
