    "intro": "Selaginella preissiana var. ramosa, commonly known as the branched spikemoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia for spore dispersal. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate and absorb nutrients from the soil. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
