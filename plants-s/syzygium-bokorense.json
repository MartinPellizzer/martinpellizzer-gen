    "intro": "Syzygium bokorense, commonly known as the Bokorens mountain apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
