    "intro": "Schizochilus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered schizochilus, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are broad, lanceolate, and have a waxy texture, while the flowers are primarily pollinated by insects. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
