    "intro": "Selaginella padangensis, commonly known as the Padang spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called microsporangia and megasporangia, are borne on specialized leaves called sporophylls. Selaginella padangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
