It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Senecio pittieri is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
