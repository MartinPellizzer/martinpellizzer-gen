    "intro": "Syringa vulgaris duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant clusters of double flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters, with dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Syringa vulgaris duplex is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and is often used in landscaping for its showy floral displays."
