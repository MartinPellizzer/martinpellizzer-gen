    "intro": "Salix melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions."
