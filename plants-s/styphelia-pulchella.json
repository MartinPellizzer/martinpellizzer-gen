    "intro": "Styphelia pulchella, commonly known as the pink mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh coastal environment. Styphelia pulchella thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is typically found in heathland and sandplain habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
