    "intro": "Silene procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate campion, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with slender stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Silene procumbens is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and rocky areas."
