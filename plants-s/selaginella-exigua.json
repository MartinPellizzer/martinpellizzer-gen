    "intro": "Selaginella exigua, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that grow in dense, compact clusters. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems and leaves. Selaginella exigua reproduces via spores, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
