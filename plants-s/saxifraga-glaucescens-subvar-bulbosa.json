    "intro": "Saxifraga glaucescens subvar. bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
