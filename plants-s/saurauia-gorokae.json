    "intro": "Saurauia gorokae, commonly known as the Kauai maqui, is a member of the Ericaceae family, native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. Saurauia gorokae thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
