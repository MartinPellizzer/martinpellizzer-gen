    "intro": "Schinopsis brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The tree is known for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry forests and savannas. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
