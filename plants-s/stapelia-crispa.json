    "intro": "Stapelia crispa, commonly known as the woolly stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in soft, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat. These flowers bloom in the summer and are designed to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia crispa is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
