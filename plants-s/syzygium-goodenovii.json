    "intro": "Syzygium goodenovii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by edible, orange-red fruits. Syzygium goodenovii is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
