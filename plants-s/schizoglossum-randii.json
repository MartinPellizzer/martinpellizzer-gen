It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schizoglossum randii is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
