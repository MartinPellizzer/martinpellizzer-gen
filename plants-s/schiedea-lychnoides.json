    "intro": "Schiedea lychnoides, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the family Cichorioideae and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Schiedea lychnoides is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the Haleakal\u0101 Crater. Due to its limited habitat and threats from invasive species, it is listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act."
