    "intro": "Silphium rigidum, commonly known as rigid compassplant, is a tall, upright perennial plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Silphium rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
