    "intro": "Sambucus herbacea, commonly known as the common elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have 5 to 9 leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Sambucus herbacea is often used in traditional medicine and for making jams, wines, and other culinary products."
