It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in musical instrument making, it has been subject to overharvesting."
