    "intro": "Salvia nemorosa, commonly known as woodland sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Salvia nemorosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
