    "intro": "Stewartia brevicalyx, commonly known as the Chinese stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split to release seeds. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and parks. The wood of Stewartia brevicalyx is highly valued for its fine grain and durability in traditional craftsmanship."
