    "intro": "Saussurea mucronata, commonly known as the Tibetan yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions in Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces small, achene-like seeds. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
