    "intro": "Searsia rogersii, commonly known as the white bract bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, white bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Searsia rogersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
