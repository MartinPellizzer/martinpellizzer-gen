    "intro": "Syzygium dupontii, commonly known as the red-fruit tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to red when mature, containing edible seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. Syzygium dupontii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit makes it suitable for hedging and as a shade tree in warm climates."
