It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and inconspicuous yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native habitat."
