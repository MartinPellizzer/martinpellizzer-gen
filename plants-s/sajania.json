    "intro": "Sajania, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that float on the surface of the water, providing a habitat for various aquatic life. Sajania thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its symbolic significance in Egyptian culture is reflected in its botanical features, which have been preserved through ancient art and texts."
