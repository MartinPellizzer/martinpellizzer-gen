    "intro": "Serratula discolor, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are serrated and hairy, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months. Serratula discolor is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
