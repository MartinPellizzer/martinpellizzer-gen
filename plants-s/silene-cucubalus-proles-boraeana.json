    "intro": "Silene cucubalus proles boraeana, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions. It is a small, mat-forming species that thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are rounded and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in Arctic ecosystems by providing food for herbivores and supporting pollinators."
