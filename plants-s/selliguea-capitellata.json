    "intro": "Selliguea capitellata, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming plant that typically grows on rocky or shaded surfaces, often in moist, humid environments. The plant features small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks and produce spores for propagation. Selliguea capitellata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
