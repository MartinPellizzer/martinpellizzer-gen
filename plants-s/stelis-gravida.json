    "intro": "Stelis gravida, commonly known as the grave's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis gravida is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests."
