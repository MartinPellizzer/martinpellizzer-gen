    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon singulare, commonly known as the Brazilian star cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It features a compact, spherical body with short, spiny stems and is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy tissues. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in a star-like formation. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
