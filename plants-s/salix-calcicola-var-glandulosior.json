    "intro": "Salix calcicola var. glandulosior, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves with a rough, glandular surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
