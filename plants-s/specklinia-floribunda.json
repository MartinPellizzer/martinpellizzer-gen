    "intro": "Specklinia floribunda, commonly known as the golden polka dot plant, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a compact, evergreen shrub that features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive yellow or cream-colored polka dot markings. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by red berries, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Specklinia floribunda is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
