    "intro": "Stipa decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for other grass species. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Stipa decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
