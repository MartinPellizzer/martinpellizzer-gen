    "intro": "Solanum andigenum convar. brevipilosum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
