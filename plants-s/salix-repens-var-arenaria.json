    "intro": "Salix repens var. arenaria, commonly known as sand willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open ground. The leaves are small, narrow, and covered with a fine, silvery-white bloom, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants. This plant is well adapted to harsh, windy environments and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils."
