    "intro": "Stipa setigera var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are typically arranged in a spike-like structure. This variety is distinguished by its elongated bracts, which give it its specific epithet \"longiaristata.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites."
