    "intro": "Sisymbrium rupestre, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. It produces slender, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Sisymbrium rupestre is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
