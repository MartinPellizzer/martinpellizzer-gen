    "intro": "Smilax horridiramula, commonly known as the rough-stemmed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, bristly spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Smilax horridiramula is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
