It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. Symplocos falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
