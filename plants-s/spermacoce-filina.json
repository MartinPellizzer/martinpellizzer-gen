    "intro": "Spermacoce filina, commonly known as the slender ladies' tears, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Spermacoce filina is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shrublands. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties."
