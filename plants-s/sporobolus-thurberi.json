    "intro": "Sporobolus thurberi, commonly known as Thurber's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
