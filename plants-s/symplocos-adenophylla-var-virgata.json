    "intro": "Symplocos adenophylla var. virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's bower or silverleaf inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and landscape use. The variety virgata is distinguished by its more densely packed leaves and slightly different leaf shape compared to the typical form."
