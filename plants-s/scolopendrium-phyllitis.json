    "intro": "Scolopendrium phyllitis, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Scolopendrium phyllitis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
