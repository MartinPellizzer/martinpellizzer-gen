    "intro": "Salacia calypso, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Salacia calypso is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
