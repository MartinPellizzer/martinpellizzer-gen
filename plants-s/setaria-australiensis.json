It is characterized by its slender, tufted spikes that bear small, bristly grains. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
