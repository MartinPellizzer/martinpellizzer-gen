    "intro": "Sida rhombifolia subsp. alnifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its alternate, narrow, rhombic-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its fibrous roots and hairy stems are adaptations that help it thrive in sandy or disturbed soils. It is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and coastal areas."
