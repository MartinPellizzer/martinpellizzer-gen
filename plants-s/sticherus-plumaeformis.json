    "intro": "Sticherus plumaeformis, commonly known as the feather moss, is a small, creeping evergreen moss that forms dense, cushion-like mats. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Sticherus plumaeformis plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
