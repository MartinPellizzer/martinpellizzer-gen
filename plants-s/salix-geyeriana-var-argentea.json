    "intro": "Salix geyeriana var. argentea, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides of its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrowly elliptical, with a soft, velvety texture and a pale green upper surface. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, brown fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
