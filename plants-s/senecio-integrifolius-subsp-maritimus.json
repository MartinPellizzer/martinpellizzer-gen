    "intro": "Senecio integrifolius subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal groundsel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, toothed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
