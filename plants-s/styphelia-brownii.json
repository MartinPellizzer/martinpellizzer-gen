    "intro": "Styphelia brownii, commonly known as the brown's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the winter months, which are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators. Styphelia brownii is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native gardens and natural habitats."
