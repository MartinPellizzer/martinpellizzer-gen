    "intro": "Silene boryi var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf silene, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene boryi var. latifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
