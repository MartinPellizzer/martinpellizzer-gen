    "intro": "Salix foetida var. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its bark is typically grayish-brown with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
