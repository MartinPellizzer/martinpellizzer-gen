    "intro": "Schefflera sphaerocoma, commonly known as the globe schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded crown with thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera sphaerocoma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
