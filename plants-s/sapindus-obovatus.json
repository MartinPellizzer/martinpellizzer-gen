    "intro": "Sapindus obovatus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate, ovate to obovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. Its most notable botanical feature is the fruit's ability to produce a soapy lather when crushed, due to the presence of saponins. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in various cultures."
