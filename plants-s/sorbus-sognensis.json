    "intro": "Sorbus sognensis, commonly known as the Sognsund rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Norway. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Sorbus sognensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
