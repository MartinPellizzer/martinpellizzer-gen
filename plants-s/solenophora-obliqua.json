    "intro": "Solenophora obliqua, commonly known as the oblique solenophora, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that curl tightly around its stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the wet season. Solenophora obliqua is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
