    "intro": "Silene oligantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene oligantha is an important species for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
