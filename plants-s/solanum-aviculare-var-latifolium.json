    "intro": "Solanum aviculare var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and wildlife."
