    "intro": "Statice armeria var. pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf statice, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are narrow and needle-like, giving the plant its common name, while the stems are typically erect and covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which are often used in dried floral arrangements."
