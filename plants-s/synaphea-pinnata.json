    "intro": "Synaphea pinnata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a secondary division of leaves, creating a finely divided appearance. Synaphea pinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
