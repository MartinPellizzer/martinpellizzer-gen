    "intro": "Satureja montana subsp. subdentata, commonly known as narrow-leaved savory, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly toothed along the edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly for its pungent, mint-like fragrance."
