It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking red, fleshy fruits that resemble small tomatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters.

The fruit is edible when ripe but contains toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care."
