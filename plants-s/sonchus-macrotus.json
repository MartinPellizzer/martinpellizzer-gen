    "intro": "Sonchus macrotus, commonly known as the giant sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a hairy stem and can grow up to 1 meter tall. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
