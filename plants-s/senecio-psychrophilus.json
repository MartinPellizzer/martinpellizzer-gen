    "intro": "Senecio psychrophilus, commonly known as the Antarctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the cold, high-altitude regions of Antarctica and southern South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. This plant is adapted to extreme cold and has a low-growing, cushion-like growth form to minimize heat loss. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. Senecio psychrophilus plays a role in the sparse flora of its environment, contributing to the ecological dynamics of polar and alpine regions."
