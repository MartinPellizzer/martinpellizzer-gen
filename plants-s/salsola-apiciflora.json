    "intro": "Salsola apiciflora, commonly known as the coast saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It has small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in saline soils. Salsola apiciflora plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal areas."
