It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain numerous seeds.
