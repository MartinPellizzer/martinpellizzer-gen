    "intro": "Serruria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly serruria, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a leathery texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Serruria tomentosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought-resistant nature."
