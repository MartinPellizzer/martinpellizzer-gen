    "intro": "Salix lapponum subsp. helvetica, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
