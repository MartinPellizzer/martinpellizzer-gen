    "intro": "Stelis porschiana, commonly known as the Porschian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Stelis porschiana has a short, erect stem with few leaves and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
