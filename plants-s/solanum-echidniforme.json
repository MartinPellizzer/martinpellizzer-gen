    "intro": "Solanum echidniforme, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like spines on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in humid, tropical environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by livestock and humans alike."
