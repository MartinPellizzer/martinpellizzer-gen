    "intro": "Sabicea caminata, commonly known as the coastal sabicea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal forests or scrublands. Due to its adaptability to salty air and wind, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
