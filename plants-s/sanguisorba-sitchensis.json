It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its coastal habitat. Sanguisorba sitchensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
