    "intro": "Scrophularia aquatica, commonly known as water figwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Scrophularia aquatica is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that help stabilize soil in wet habitats."
