    "intro": "Sagittaria rigida, commonly known as rigid arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. Sagittaria rigida plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
