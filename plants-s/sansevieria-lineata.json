    "intro": "Sansevieria lineata, commonly known as the Variegated Snake Plant, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are light green with distinct white or yellow variegation patterns. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal houseplant. Its leaves are stiff and fibrous, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Sansevieria lineata is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, as it can absorb toxins from the air."
