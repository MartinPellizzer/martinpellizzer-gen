    "intro": "Syzygium sirindhorniae, commonly known as the Sirindhorn's star apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by edible, star-shaped fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and fruit production, though it is relatively rare in cultivation. The species was named in honor of Queen Sirikit of Thailand, reflecting its cultural significance in the region."
