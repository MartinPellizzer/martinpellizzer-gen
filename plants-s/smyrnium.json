    "intro": "Smyrnium, commonly known as cow parsley, is a genus of flowering plants in theApiaceae family. It features slender, hollow stems and umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The leaves are typically finely divided and resemble those of parsley, hence its common name. Smyrnium species are often found in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
