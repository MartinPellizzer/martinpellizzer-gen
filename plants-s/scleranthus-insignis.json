It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with stiff, bristly hairs.

Scleranthus insignis has small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain one or two seeds."
