    "intro": "Sonchus platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Sonchus platylepis is considered a weed in some areas but has also been used in traditional medicine."
