    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos makassaricus, commonly known as the Makassar starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
