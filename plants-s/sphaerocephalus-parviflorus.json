    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered globehead, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
