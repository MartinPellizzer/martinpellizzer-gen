    "intro": "Sida nemorensis, commonly known as the forest sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Sida nemorensis has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
