    "intro": "Sarcostemma pallidum, commonly known as the pale milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing toxic, orange-red seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its milky sap, it is sometimes referred to as a milkweed, though it is not closely related to the North American milkweeds."
