    "intro": "Stylidium fasciculatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed triggerplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces striking, red-orange flowers that are spurred at the base, a feature typical of the genus Stylidium. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. This species is known for its unique mechanical flowering mechanism, where the flower stalk is triggered to release pollen when touched."
