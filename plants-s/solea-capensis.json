    "intro": "Solea capensis, commonly known as the Cape sole, is a marine fish species found along the southern African coast. It belongs to the family Soleidae and is characterized by its flattened body and camouflage-like coloration. The fish typically inhabits sandy and muddy seabeds, where it burrows to avoid predators. It is a benthic feeder, primarily consuming small invertebrates such as crustaceans and mollusks. Due to its ecological importance, it is often targeted by commercial fisheries in the region."
