    "intro": "Scelochilus langkastii, commonly known as the Langkawi orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Peninsular Malaysia. It is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers and sympodial growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scelochilus langkastii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
