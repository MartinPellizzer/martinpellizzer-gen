    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon balcana, commonly known as the Balkan saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern with fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
