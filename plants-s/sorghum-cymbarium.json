    "intro": "Sorghum cymbarium, commonly known as the clustered sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often used for forage or ornamental purposes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and agricultural studies."
