    "intro": "Sporobolus clandestinus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, awned lemmas that are often mistaken for seeds, but they are actually bracts. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Sporobolus clandestinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
