    "intro": "Stemonurus penangianus, commonly known as the Penang starwort, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Malaysia and Singapore. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-like white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
