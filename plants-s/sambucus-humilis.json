    "intro": "Sambucus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf elderberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 feet and features clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Sambucus humilis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
