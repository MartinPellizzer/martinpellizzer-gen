    "intro": "Santaloides minor subsp. monadelpha, commonly known as the dwarf sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and reduced, often scale-like leaves on its stems. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
