    "intro": "Schaefferia viridescens, commonly known as the greenleaf schaefferia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid regions."
