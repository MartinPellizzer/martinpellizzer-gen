    "intro": "Specklinia vittariifolia, commonly known as the veined fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a striking contrast between the green and pale underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on high humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of roots, which helps in moisture retention. The veined appearance of its leaves is a distinctive botanical feature, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
