    "intro": "Sebaea pusilla var. major, commonly known as the giant sebaea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. Sebaea pusilla var. major is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
