    "intro": "Schizaea propinqua, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Schizaeaceae. It is a small, creeping herb that forms dense mats on the forest floor, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. Schizaea propinqua reproduces via spores, which are released from small, specialized structures called sporangia. Its structure and growth habit make it an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate and tropical forests."
