    "intro": "Sambucus nigra f. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-variegated elderberry, is a decorative cultivar of the elderberry plant. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display white and green patterns, making it visually appealing in gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It is typically grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage rather than its edible berries. This cultivar thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
