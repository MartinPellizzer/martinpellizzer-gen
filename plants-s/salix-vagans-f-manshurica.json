    "intro": "Salix vagans f. manshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian weeping willow, is a variant of the weeping willow native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its catkins and small, inconspicuous flowers contribute to its reproductive strategy, while its ornamental appearance makes it a popular garden specimen. The foliage turns a striking golden-yellow in autumn, adding to its visual appeal."
