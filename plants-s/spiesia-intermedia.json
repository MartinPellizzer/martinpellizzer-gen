It is characterized by its smooth, often milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Spiesia intermedia produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
