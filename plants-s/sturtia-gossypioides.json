    "intro": "Sturtia gossypioides, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Sturtia gossypioides is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers."
