    "intro": "Selaginella pouzolziana var. punctata, commonly known as the speckled spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by the presence of small, dark spots on its leaves, giving it its common name."
