    "intro": "Salvia polystachia subsp. durandiana, commonly known as the Durand's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Salvia genus, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits."
