    "intro": "Sphaeralcea lobata var. perpallida, commonly known as the white globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its propagation in dry, rocky soils. This species is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
