    "intro": "Stelis floribunda, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
