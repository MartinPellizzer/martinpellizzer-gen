It is a small annual herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct floral structure and adaptability to cooler climates."
