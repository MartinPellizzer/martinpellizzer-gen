    "intro": "Symplocos dung, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or mountain elder, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth and small, leathery leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Symplocos dung is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations."
