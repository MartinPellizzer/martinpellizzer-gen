It can grow up to 6 meters in height and is characterized by its robust, hollow stems and large, narrow leaves. The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in wetland or brackish environments. Its rhizomes are used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Saccharum narenga plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
