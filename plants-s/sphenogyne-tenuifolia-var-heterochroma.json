    "intro": "Sphenogyne tenuifolia var. heterochroma, commonly known as the variegated slender leaf sphenogyne, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that exhibit a unique variegation pattern, often featuring contrasting colors such as white, green, and yellow. The plant produces small, clustered umbels of white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
