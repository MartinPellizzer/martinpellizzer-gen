    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both surfaces. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typical of willow species, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
