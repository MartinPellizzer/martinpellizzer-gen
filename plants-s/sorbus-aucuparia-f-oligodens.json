It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in woodland and rocky habitats. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated margin. Its fruits are small, red berries that persist through winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife.
