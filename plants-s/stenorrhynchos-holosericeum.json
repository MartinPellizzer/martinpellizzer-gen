    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos holosericeum, commonly known as the silky sandstone lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its dense, woolly growth that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its structure consists of a thallus that is covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. This lichen is often found on rock surfaces and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
