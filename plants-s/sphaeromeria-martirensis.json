    "intro": "Sphaeromeria martirensis, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Sphaeromeria martirensis is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance."
