    "intro": "Spathium, commonly known as the spathiphyllum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored spathe, which is a modified leaf that encloses the smaller, inconspicuous spadix. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Spathium species are typically evergreen, with broad, waxy leaves that are glossy in appearance. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and long-lasting, elegant flowers."
