    "intro": "Stelis affinis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, with its roots anchored in the substrate rather than in soil. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink, arranged in a spike-like cluster. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Stelis affinis is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
