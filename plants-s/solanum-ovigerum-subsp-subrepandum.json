    "intro": "Solanum ovigerum subsp. subrepandum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, followed by yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management."
