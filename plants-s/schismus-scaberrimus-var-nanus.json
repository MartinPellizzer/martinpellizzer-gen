    "intro": "Schismus scaberrimus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
