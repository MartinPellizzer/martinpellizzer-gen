    "intro": "Suregada aequorea, commonly known as the moon jellyfish, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the class Scyphozoa. It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped body and delicate, radial tentacles used for capturing prey. The organism exhibits a unique life cycle that includes both a polyp stage and a medusa stage. Its bioluminescent properties are a result of symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae living within its tissues. This species is found in coastal waters around the world and plays an important role in marine ecosystems."
