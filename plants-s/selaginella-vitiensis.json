    "intro": "Selaginella vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged leaves and a short, erect stem that bears spore-producing structures called strobila. It is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. Selaginella vitiensis plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
