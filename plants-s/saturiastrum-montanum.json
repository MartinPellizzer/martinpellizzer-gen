    "intro": "Saturiastrum montanum, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Saturiastrum montanum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
