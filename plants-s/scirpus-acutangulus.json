    "intro": "Scirpus acutangulus, commonly known as the sharp-tipped bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and flowering spikes that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in marshy areas, pond edges, and along rivers, where it helps stabilize soil and filter water. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, making it an important species for wetland restoration. Scirpus acutangulus is also a valuable food source for waterfowl and other wetland wildlife."
