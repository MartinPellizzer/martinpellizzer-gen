    "intro": "Solanum bukasovii, commonly known as the Bukasov's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
