It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for both ornamental and drought-tolerant landscaping."
