    "intro": "Schoenus spicatus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Schoenus spicatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
