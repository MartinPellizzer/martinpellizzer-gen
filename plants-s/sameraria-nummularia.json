It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. Sameraria nummularia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance requirements."
