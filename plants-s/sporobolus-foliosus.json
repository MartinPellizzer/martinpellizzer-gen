    "intro": "Sporobolus foliosus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer. It is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing habit, making it suitable for erosion control. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas."
