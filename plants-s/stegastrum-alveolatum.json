    "intro": "Stegastrum alveolatum, commonly known as the sand spiker, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the leaves, making it less conspicuous. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in full sun. Stegastrum alveolatum is adapted to coastal and inland dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
