    "intro": "Scilla scythica, commonly known as the steppe squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental plants. Scilla scythica is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its early blooming habit."
