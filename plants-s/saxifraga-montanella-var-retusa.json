    "intro": "Saxifraga montanella var. retusa, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians. The variety 'retusa' is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical form."
