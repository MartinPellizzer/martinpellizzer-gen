    "intro": "Sarcochilus chapaensis, commonly known as the Chapa\u2019s sarcochilus, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and possesses dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with yellow petals and a distinctive red lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss, it is critically threatened in the wild."
