    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. tocanum, commonly known as the Tocanum potato, is a botanical variant of the Andean potato species. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant produces tuberous roots that are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source by indigenous communities. Its botanical features include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and small, yellowish flowers. This variety is valued not only for its agricultural potential but also for its ecological and cultural significance in the Andean region."
