    "intro": "Sobralia kruskayae, commonly known as the Kruskay's sobralia, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It features vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of orange and red. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it grows on trees rather than in soil. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens and greenhouses. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Sobralia kruskayae is considered a threatened species in the wild."
