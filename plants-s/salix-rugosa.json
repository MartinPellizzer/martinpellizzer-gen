    "intro": "Salix rugosa, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Salix rugosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
