    "intro": "Stelis preclara, commonly known as the elegant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, often featuring white or pale pink petals. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis preclara is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
