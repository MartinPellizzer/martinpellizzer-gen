    "intro": "Sagina kevandensis, commonly known as Kevand's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Sagina kevandensis is often found in high-altitude meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
