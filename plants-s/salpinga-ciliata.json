    "intro": "Salpinga ciliata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine, ciliated hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor water and uses its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and carnivory."
