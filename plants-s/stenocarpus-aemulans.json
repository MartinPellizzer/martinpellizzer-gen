    "intro": "Stenocarpus aemulans, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, white or pink flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody stems and leathery leaves are adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. Stenocarpus aemulans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and semi-arid environments."
