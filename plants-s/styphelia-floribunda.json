    "intro": "Styphelia floribunda, commonly known as the showy greenbriar, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late winter to early spring. Styphelia floribunda thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild temperatures and salt spray. It is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, playing a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
