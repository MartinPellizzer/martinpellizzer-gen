    "intro": "Secamone insularis var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf secamone, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific island habitats. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in coastal or forested areas. Its botanical structure includes fibrous roots and a woody stem, which help it adapt to its specific ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
