    "intro": "Swainsona microcalyx, commonly known as the small-fruited swainsona, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that dehisces to release seeds. Swainsona microcalyx is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand high temperatures."
