    "intro": "Stipa tenerrima, commonly known as Spanish needle or goat grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery, bristle-like seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Stipa tenerrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its elegant, airy appearance."
