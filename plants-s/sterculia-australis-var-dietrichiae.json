It is characterized by its rough, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing smooth, oval seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This variety is valued for its ecological role and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental features."
