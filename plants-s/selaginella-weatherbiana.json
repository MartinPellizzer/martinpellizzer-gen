    "intro": "Selaginella weatherbiana, commonly known as the Weatherby's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain spores, a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
