    "intro": "Salvia lavandula, commonly known as lavender, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces spikes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its essential oils, extracted from the flowers and leaves, are widely used in aromatherapy, perfumery, and medicinal applications. Salvia lavandula thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation."
