    "intro": "Stipa subsessiliflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
