    "intro": "Skimmia reevesiana f. rubella, commonly known as the red-leafed skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep red to maroon color, providing striking visual interest throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
