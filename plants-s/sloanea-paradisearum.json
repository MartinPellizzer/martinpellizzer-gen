    "intro": "Sloanea paradisearum, commonly known as the Paradise Sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are usually glossy and dark green, and its clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Sloanea paradisearum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic qualities. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
