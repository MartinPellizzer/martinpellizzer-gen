    "intro": "Scleria riparia, commonly known as the river marsh grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along rivers and streams. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Scleria riparia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
