    "intro": "Sarcochilus compressus, commonly known as the compressed sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow and purple coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in the orchid family, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Sarcochilus compressus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
