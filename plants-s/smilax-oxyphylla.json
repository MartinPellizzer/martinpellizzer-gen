    "intro": "Smilax oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharpstem smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth, which help it climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Smilax oxyphylla is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
