    "intro": "Scilla dumetorum, commonly known as the woodland scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant typically grows in woodland areas, meadows, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and evergreen, remaining throughout the year. Scilla dumetorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
