    "intro": "Schwantesia herrei f. major, commonly known as the giant Schwantesia, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces impressive, feather-like inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, typical of many palm species. Its growth habit is often described as a tree-like form, with a single trunk and a crown of leaves. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by collectors and botanic gardens."
