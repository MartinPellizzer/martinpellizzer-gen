    "intro": "Stylosanthes aurea, commonly known as golden stylo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its seeds are enclosed in pods. Stylosanthes aurea is often used as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
