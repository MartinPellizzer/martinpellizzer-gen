    "intro": "Stictocardia laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered stictocardia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
