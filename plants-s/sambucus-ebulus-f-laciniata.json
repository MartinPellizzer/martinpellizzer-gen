    "intro": "Sambucus ebulus f. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf elderberry, is a variant of the elderberry plant characterized by its finely lobed, maple-like leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America, typically growing in moist woodland areas. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain seeds that are toxic if consumed raw. The cutleaf form is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf lobing compared to the typical species."
