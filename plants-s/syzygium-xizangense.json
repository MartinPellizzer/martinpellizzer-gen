    "intro": "Syzygium xizangense, commonly known as the Yunnan sandalwood, is a rare evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown wood. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syzygium xizangense is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native environment."
