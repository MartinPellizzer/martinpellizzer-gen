    "intro": "Senegalia rufescens, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its gray-green, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Its roots can fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil improvement in degraded lands. Senegalia rufescens is also used traditionally for its wood, which is durable and resistant to termites."
