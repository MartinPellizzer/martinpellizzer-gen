    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 benthamii, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to flourish."
