It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in saturated soils. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are reddish-brown in color, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.
