    "intro": "Sporobolus setulosus, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive silky, hairy leaves that give it a soft appearance. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Silky wheatgrass is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is also used in some traditional medicinal practices."
