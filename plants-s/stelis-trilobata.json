    "intro": "Stelis trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. Stelis trilobata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
