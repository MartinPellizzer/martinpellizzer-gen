    "intro": "Stelis nikiae, commonly known as the Nikia orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis nikiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
