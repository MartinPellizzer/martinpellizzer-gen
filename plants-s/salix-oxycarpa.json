    "intro": "Salix oxycarpa, commonly known as the sharp-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and Nepal. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, woody capsules that contain its seeds. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
