    "intro": "Suttonia knudsenii, commonly known as the Knudsen's suttonia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat branched. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Suttonia knudsenii is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
