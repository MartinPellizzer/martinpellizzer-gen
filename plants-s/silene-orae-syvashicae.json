    "intro": "Silene orae-syvashicae, commonly known as the Syvash coastflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Black Sea. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline soils and is adapted to the harsh, windy conditions of its coastal habitat. It is often found growing along the shores of the Syvash lagoon in Ukraine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
