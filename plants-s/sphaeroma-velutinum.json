    "intro": "Sphaeroma velutinum, commonly known as the velvet barnacle, is a small, calcareous crustacean that belongs to the family Sphaeromatidae. It is characterized by its smooth, rounded shell that is often covered in a fine, velvety layer, giving it its common name. This species is typically found in marine environments, attaching itself to rocks or other hard substrates. The shell is composed primarily of calcium carbonate, providing structural support and protection. Sphaeroma velutinum plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to the formation of biofilms and serving as a food source for various marine organisms."
