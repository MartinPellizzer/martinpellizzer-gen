    "intro": "Sertula polonica, commonly known as the Polish sertula, is a rare and endangered plant species native to specific regions of Poland. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested or semi-shaded habitats. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, while its flowers are small and white or pale green. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sertula polonica is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
