    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
