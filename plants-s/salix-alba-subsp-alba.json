    "intro": "Salix alba subsp. alba, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it is known for its medicinal properties due to the presence of salicin, a compound similar to aspirin. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine make it a notable species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
