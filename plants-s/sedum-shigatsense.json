    "intro": "Sedum shigatsense, commonly known as the Shigatsune sedum, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the summer months. Sedum shigatsense is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
