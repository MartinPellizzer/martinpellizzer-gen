    "intro": "Sedum stimulosum, commonly known as the stimulant stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
