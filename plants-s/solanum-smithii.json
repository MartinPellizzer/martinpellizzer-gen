    "intro": "Solanum smithii, commonly known as Smith's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with woody stems and elliptical, dark green leaves. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
