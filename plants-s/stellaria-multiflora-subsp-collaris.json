    "intro": "Stellaria multiflora subsp. collaris, commonly known as the sandstem starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often arranged in a basal rosette, and are adapted to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
