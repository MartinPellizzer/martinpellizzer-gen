    "intro": "Senecio marnieri, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Senecio marnieri is also noted for its drought tolerance and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant."
