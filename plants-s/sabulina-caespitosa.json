    "intro": "Sabulina caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are surrounded by green sepals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Sabulina caespitosa is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insect species."
