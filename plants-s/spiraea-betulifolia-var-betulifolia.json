It features slender, arching branches that are often covered in a silvery-white bloom of small, fluffy flowers in the spring. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
