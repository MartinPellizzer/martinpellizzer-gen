    "intro": "Santalodes rugosum, commonly known as the rough santalum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its rugged, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
