    "intro": "Santiria minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, spiny fruits known as burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Santiria minutiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
