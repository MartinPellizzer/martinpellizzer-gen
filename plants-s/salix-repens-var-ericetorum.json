    "intro": "Salix repens var. ericetorum, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands."
