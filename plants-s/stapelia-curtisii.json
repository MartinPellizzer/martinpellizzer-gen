    "intro": "Stapelia curtisii, commonly known as the \"Curtis's Stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy stems. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its thick stems to survive in arid conditions. Stapelia curtisii is a popular choice for collectors due to its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements."
