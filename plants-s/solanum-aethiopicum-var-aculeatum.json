    "intro": "Solanum aethiopicum var. aculeatum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into green, fleshy berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, so caution is necessary. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils."
