    "intro": "Sanicula chinensis var. involucrata, commonly known as the Chinese sanicle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often branched towards the top. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spiky inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
