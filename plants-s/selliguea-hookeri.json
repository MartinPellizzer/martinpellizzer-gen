    "intro": "Selliguea hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's rockcap, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct upper surface that is green and covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Selliguea hookeri is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid climates with high levels of moisture. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, moist habitats."
