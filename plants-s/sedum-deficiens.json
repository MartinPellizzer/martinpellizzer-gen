    "intro": "Sedum deficiens, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant, suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The ghost plant is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements in dry climates."
