    "intro": "Stylocoryna rheedei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
