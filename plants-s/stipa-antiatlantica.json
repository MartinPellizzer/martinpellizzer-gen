    "intro": "Stipa antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of western Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salty air and coastal winds. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa antiatlantica plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is of interest for its ecological resilience in harsh environments."
