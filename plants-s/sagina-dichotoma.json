    "intro": "Sagina dichotoma, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dunes, due to its ability to tolerate harsh conditions. Sagina dichotoma plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
