    "intro": "Stipa elegantissima, commonly known as the elegant feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and delicate, feathery panicles that give it a soft, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance. Stipa elegantissima plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native environment."
