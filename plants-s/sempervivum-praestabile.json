It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Sempervivum praestabile is also known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates."
