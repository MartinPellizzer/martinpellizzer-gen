    "intro": "Sagina nodosa, commonly known as the mossy pearlwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically rounded and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. Sagina nodosa is often found in rocky crevices, woodland floors, and along stream banks."
