    "intro": "Silphium dentatum var. angustatum, commonly known as narrow-leaved compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It features tall, branching stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have toothed margins. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system is thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients, which allows it to thrive in dry, prairie environments. Silphium dentatum var. angustatum is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of edible oils."
