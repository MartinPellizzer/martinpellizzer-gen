    "intro": "Silene nicaeensis var. pseudoramosissima, commonly known as the Nicaea catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is distinguished by its more branched inflorescence compared to the typical form of Silene nicaeensis."
