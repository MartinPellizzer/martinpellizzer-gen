    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic compounds such as solasodine. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many parts of the world."
