    "intro": "Spanoghea connata, commonly known as the Florida bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and periodic flooding. Spanoghea connata plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a characteristic species of the Florida scrub ecosystem."
