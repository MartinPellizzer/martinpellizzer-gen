    "intro": "Spirostachys occidentalis, commonly known as the western spirostachy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and the ability to tolerate drought conditions, making it well adapted to its native habitat. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
