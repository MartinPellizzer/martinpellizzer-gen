    "intro": "Saxifraga mertensiana var. eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, providing protection against intense sunlight and desiccation. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the short growing season. It is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, making it a characteristic species of tundra and mountain habitats."
