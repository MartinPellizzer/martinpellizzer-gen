    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos daymanianus, commonly known as the Daymanian star-flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals that radiate outward, giving it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
