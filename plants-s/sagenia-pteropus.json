    "intro": "Sagenia pteropus, commonly known as the winged sage, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on its stems, which are adaptations for wind dispersal of its seeds. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Sagenia pteropus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats."
