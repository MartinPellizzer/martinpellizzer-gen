It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, acicular leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It is often found growing on the trunks and branches of fir trees in mountainous regions. Solenophora abietorum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small invertebrates."
