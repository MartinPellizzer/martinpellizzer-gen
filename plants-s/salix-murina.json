    "intro": "Salix murina, commonly known as the common black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often riparian habitats, such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, willow-like branches and produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Salix murina is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its historical use in traditional medicine."
