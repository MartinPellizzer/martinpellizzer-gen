    "intro": "Sarcophyllus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a delicate, orchid-like appearance. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Sarcophyllus is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
