    "intro": "Salvia \u00d7 atroviolacea, commonly known as the deep purple sage, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking violet to purple flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia \u00d7 atroviolacea is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
