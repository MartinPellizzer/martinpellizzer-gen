    "intro": "Serratula spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Serratula spinulosa is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. It has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
