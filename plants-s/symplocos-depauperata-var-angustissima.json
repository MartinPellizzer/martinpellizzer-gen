    "intro": "Symplocos depauperata var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand cherry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its botanical features include a woody stem, alternate leaves, and a preference for well-drained soils. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
