    "intro": "Stelis lorenae, commonly known as the Lorena's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
