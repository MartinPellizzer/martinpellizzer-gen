    "intro": "Spergularia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through wind dispersal. Spergularia glandulosa is also known for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it a common species in coastal environments."
