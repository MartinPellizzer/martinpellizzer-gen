    "intro": "Sarcanthus complicatus, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is characterized by its intricate, twisting stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Sarcanthus complicatus is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas where it establishes a symbiotic relationship with its host."
