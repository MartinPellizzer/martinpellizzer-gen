    "intro": "Sagina sabuletorum var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces tiny white or pink flowers in early spring. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand. Its botanical features reflect its specialized adaptation to harsh, maritime environments."
