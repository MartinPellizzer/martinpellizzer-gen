    "intro": "Sorbus montisalpae, commonly known as the Alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are red when mature. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Sorbus montisalpae plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing food for birds and insects."
