    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris f. foliosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower heads that appear in late summer. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the stabilization of wetland soils. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
