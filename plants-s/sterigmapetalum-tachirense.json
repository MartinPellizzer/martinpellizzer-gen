    "intro": "Sterigmapetalum tachirense, commonly known as the Tachira starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
