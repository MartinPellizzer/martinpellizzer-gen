It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are often a striking combination of red and yellow. It typically blooms during the summer months and is known for its compact, terrestrial growth habit. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated by horticulturists."
