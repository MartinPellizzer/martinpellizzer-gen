    "intro": "Solanoides, commonly known as the nightshade plant, is a genus within the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its typically herbaceous or shrub-like growth habit and often features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are usually alternate and can be simple or lobed, while the fruits are usually berries or capsules. Many species within this genus produce toxic compounds, particularly in their berries, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Despite its potential toxicity, Solanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
