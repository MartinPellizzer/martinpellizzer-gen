    "intro": "Solanum gabrielae, commonly known as Gabriel's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to cool climates. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, toxic berries that are not suitable for human consumption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum gabrielae is considered a rare and endemic species."
