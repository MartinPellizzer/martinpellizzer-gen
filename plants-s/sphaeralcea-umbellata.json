    "intro": "Sphaeralcea umbellata, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lobed and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea umbellata is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
