    "intro": "Schoenus caespititius, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It forms dense, clump-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. Schoenus caespititius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
