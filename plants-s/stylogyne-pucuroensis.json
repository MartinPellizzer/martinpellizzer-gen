    "intro": "Stylogyne pucuroensis, commonly known as the Pucuro endemic, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with violet petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, demonstrating adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stylogyne pucuroensis is considered a vulnerable species."
