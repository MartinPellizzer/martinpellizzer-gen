    "intro": "Selaginella burkei var. louisiadensis, commonly known as the Lushan spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosettes of needle-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
