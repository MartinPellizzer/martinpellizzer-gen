    "intro": "Saxifraga osloensis f. filiformis, commonly known as the Oslo saxifrage filiformis form, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Norway. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variant is notable for its unique, elongated foliage that distinguishes it from other saxifrage species."
