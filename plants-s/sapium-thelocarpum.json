    "intro": "Sapium thelocarpum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by yellow-orange fruits that split open to release fluffy seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
