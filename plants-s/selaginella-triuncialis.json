    "intro": "Selaginella triuncialis, commonly known as the clubmoss or sedge moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella triuncialis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in controlled environments."
