It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. Its berries, which are toxic, mature to a bright red color and are often mistaken for edible fruits. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically found in remote or undisturbed habitats."
