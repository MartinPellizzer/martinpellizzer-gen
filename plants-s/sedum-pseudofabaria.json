    "intro": "Sedum pseudofabaria, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves helps it survive in arid environments."
