    "intro": "Specklinia funerea, commonly known as the black-stemmed tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish. Its unique appearance, with dark green foliage and a striking contrast in color, makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Specklinia funerea is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves."
