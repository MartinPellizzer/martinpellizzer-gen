    "intro": "Solanum pinnatisectum var. pentazygum, commonly known as the five-lobed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
