    "intro": "Solanum tomentosum var. scabriusculum, commonly known as the rough hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, fleshy berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
