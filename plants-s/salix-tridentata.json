    "intro": "Salix tridentata, commonly known as the tridentate willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Salix tridentata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
