    "intro": "Salsola vermiculata var. microphylla, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed areas. Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
