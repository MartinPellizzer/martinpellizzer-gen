    "intro": "Salicornia fruticosa var. corticosa, commonly known as sea beans or marsh samphire, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a powdery coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and reduce in size as the plant matures, contributing to its salt tolerance. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
