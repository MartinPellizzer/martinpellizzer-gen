It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, vibrant red fruits that resemble tiny tomatoes. The plant typically grows in coastal areas with high salinity, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
