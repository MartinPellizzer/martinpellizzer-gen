    "intro": "Scleropoa rigida var. patens, commonly known as the rigid fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
