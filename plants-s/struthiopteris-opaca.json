    "intro": "Struthiopteris opaca, commonly known as the barren woodsorrel, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense network of roots, and its fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and structure. The leaves are pinnately divided, with finely toothed margins, and the sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds. It is characterized by its lack of showy flowers, as it reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
