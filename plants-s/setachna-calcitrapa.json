    "intro": "Setachna calcitrapa, commonly known as the limestone catchfly, is a flowering plant native to calcareous soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species in many regions."
