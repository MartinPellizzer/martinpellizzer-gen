    "intro": "Salix japonica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, rivers, or in wetland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
