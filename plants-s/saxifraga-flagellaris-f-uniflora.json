    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that bears a single, showy white or pink flower with five petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
