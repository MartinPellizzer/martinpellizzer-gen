    "intro": "Sideritis \u00d7 candelii var. berchmansii, commonly known as the Berchman's sainfoin, is a flowering plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in Greece and Albania. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
