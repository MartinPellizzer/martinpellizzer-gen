    "intro": "Schoenocaulon oaxacense, commonly known as the Oaxaca mountain star, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
