    "intro": "Smilax scalaris, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with sharp, curved thorns and heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and thorny structure make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
