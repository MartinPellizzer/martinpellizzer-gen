    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. latefoliolata, commonly known as the late-leaved whitebeam, is a botanical variant of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its delayed leaf emergence, with foliage appearing later in the growing season compared to the typical form. The leaves are generally larger and have a more elongated shape than those of the standard species. This form is often found in woodland habitats, where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical interest lies in its unique phenological traits and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
