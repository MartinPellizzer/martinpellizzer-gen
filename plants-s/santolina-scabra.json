    "intro": "Santolina scabra, commonly known as silver thyme or woolly santolina, is a low-growing, aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Santolina scabra is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a versatile plant for both ornamental and medicinal uses."
