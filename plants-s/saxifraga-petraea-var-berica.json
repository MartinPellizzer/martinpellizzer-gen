    "intro": "Saxifraga petraea var. berica, commonly known as the Scottish saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Scottish Highlands and parts of northern England. It thrives in rocky, alpine, or limestone-rich environments, often found on cliffs, scree slopes, and gravelly soils. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, toothed leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a compact growth form that minimizes water loss and withstands strong winds. This variety is notable for its horticultural value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
