    "intro": "Scoliosorus ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive frond structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Scoliosorus ensiformis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
