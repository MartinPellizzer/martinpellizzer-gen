    "intro": "Symplocos gambliana, commonly known as the Indian snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a striking feature of the plant. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has medicinal uses in traditional systems of medicine, particularly for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
