    "intro": "Salix hastata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows along stream banks and moist soils, thriving in wetland environments. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
