    "intro": "Serratula monardii f. abulensis, commonly known as the Abulensian goldenweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces clusters of bright yellow ray flowers surrounded by smaller disk flowers. The plant is characterized by its serrated leaf margins, which give it its genus name, and it typically blooms from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
