    "intro": "Salix daiseniensis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
