    "intro": "Serratula squalida, commonly known as the sticky serratula, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that are surrounded by bracts, and its leaves are typically hairy and serrated. Serratula squalida is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
