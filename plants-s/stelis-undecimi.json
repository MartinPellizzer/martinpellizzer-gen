    "intro": "Stelis undecimi, commonly known as the eleven-ribbed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows epiphytically, meaning it attaches itself to trees or other surfaces without being parasitic. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis undecimi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
