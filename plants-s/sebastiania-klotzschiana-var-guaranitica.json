    "intro": "Sebastiania klotzschiana var. guaranitica, commonly known as the Guarani torchtree, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling torches, hence its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat."
