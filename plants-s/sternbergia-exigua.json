    "intro": "Sternbergia exigua, commonly known as the Spanish snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a bulbous perennial that produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded. Sternbergia exigua prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
