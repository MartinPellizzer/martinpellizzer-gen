    "intro": "Stellaria lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, downy hairs, contributing to its soft texture. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Stellaria lanuginosa is often found in sandy or loamy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
