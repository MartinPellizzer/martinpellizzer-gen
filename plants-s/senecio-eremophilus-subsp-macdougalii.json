    "intro": "Senecio eremophilus subsp. macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's blueweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky slopes and open woodlands, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
