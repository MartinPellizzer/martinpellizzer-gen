    "intro": "Solisia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its dark green stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Solisia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
