    "intro": "Sceletium concavum, commonly known as Koro or the \"Kalahari plant,\" is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly mesembrine, which contributes to its psychoactive properties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal regions. Due to its unique chemical composition, it has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for its stimulating and euphoric effects."
