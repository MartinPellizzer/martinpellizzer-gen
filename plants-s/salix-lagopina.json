    "intro": "Salix lagopina, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Salix lagopina is also notable for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
