    "intro": "Solenostemon repens, commonly known as creeping spikeplant, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling stem that often lies close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in spikes along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Solenostemon repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
