    "intro": "Siparuna magnifica, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Siparuna magnifica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a specimen plant due to its vibrant floral display."
