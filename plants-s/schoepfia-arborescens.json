    "intro": "Schoepfia arborescens, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant. Its growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert regions."
