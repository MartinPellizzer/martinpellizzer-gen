    "intro": "Stelis lasallei, commonly known as the Lasalle's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting mix for optimal growth. Stelis lasallei is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
