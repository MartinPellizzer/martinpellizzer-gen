    "intro": "Salix radinostachya var. pseudophanera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features slender, flexible stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion."
