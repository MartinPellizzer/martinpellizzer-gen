    "intro": "Selinum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor selenium, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its low-growing habit and delicate appearance, it is a relatively rare and specialized species."
