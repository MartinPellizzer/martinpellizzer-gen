    "intro": "Scirpus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus bulbosus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
