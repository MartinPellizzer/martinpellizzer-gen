    "intro": "Sabina vulgaris var. erectopatens, commonly known as the upright juniper, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense, needle-like clusters. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance contribute to its low-maintenance appeal in arid landscapes."
