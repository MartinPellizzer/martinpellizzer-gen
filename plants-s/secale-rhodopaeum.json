    "intro": "Secale rhodopaeum, commonly known as the Rhodope ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to bluish-gray flowers, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
