    "intro": "Schefflera kontumensis, commonly known as the Kontum schefflera, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the remote mountainous regions of Vietnam. It is characterized by its dense, palmate compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid forest environments. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
