    "intro": "Selaginella xichouensis, commonly known as the Xichou spikemoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan Province, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a characteristic known as heterospory. Its sporophyte stage is short-lived, and it relies on its gametophyte stage for long-term survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selaginella xichouensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
