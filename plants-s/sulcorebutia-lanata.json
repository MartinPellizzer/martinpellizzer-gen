It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that resembles a rabbit's foot, giving it its common name. The plant features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white coating. It produces tall, branched stems with yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Sulcorebutia lanata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
