    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris var. digynus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize shorelines. The variety digynus is distinguished by its unique floral structure, with separate male and female flowers on different inflorescences."
