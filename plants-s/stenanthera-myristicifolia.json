    "intro": "Stenanthera myristicifolia, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom during the holiday season, typically between September and December. The plant features a compact, evergreen shrub with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive red or purple lip that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
