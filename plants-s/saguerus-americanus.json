    "intro": "Saguerus americanus, commonly known as the American saguaro, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with prominent ribs and spines, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy stem, allowing it to endure long periods of drought. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by bats and insects. The saguaro is an important part of the Sonoran Desert ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
