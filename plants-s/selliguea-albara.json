    "intro": "Selliguea albara, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its small, flattened, and often crinkled thallus, which is typically green or yellowish in color. This plant thrives in rocky, arid, or shaded environments, often found on soil or stone surfaces. Selliguea albara is a non-vascular plant that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying on its thallus for nutrient absorption. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
