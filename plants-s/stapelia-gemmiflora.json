    "intro": "Stapelia gemmiflora, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, fleshy flowers that resemble rotting meat, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its flowers typically bloom in summer, opening in the late afternoon and closing at dawn. Stapelia gemmiflora is also known for its ability to produce offsets, making it relatively easy to propagate."
