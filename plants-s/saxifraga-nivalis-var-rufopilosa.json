    "intro": "Saxifraga nivalis var. rufopilosa, commonly known as the red-haired snow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This variety is particularly notable for its striking red-pink coloration, which sets it apart from other members of the Saxifraga genus."
