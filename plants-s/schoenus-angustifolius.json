    "intro": "Schoenus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and stabilizing wetland soils."
