    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive carpets in its natural habitat."
