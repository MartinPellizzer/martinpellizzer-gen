    "intro": "Sidalcea oregana var. calva, commonly known as the western fairy-bells, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside habitats. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is part of the legume family and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils through its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
