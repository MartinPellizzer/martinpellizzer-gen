    "intro": "Schoutenia kostermansii, commonly known as the Kostermans' schoutenia, is a rare tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae, which includes many species with large, showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, narrow leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are often clustered in panicles, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
