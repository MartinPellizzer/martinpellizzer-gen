    "intro": "Salix microphyta, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and tiny, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found growing in tundra or rocky habitats. Salix microphyta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic flora and fauna."
