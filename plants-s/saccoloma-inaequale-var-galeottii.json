    "intro": "Saccoloma inaequale var. galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are clusters of sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
