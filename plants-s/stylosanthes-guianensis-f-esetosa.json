    "intro": "Stylosanthes guianensis f. esetosa, commonly known as the hairy stylosanthes, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in agricultural systems for its nitrogen-fixing ability. The hairy form of this species is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which may aid in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores."
