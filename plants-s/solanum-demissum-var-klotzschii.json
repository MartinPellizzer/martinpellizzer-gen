    "intro": "Solanum demissum var. klotzschii, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berry-like fruits, which are typically red when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
