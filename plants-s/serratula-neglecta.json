It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions. Serratula neglecta is also known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic in high doses."
