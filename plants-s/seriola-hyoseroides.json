    "intro": "Seriola hyoseroides, commonly known as the Japanese horse mackerel, is a marine fish belonging to the family Scombridae. It is characterized by its streamlined body, silver-scaled skin, and a distinctive black lateral stripe. The plant-like appearance of its scales and the way it moves through water have led to its botanical-like name. It thrives in warm coastal waters and is often found in schools near the surface. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey."
