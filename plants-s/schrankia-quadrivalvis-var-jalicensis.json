The plant exhibits a unique morphology with four-valved fruits, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
