    "intro": "Sium frigidum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. Its roots are often harvested for their aromatic properties, though the plant is toxic if ingested in large quantities. Sium frigidum plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
