    "intro": "Saxifraga neglecta, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or woodland environments. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, producing white or pale pink blooms that appear in early spring. Saxifraga neglecta is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas."
