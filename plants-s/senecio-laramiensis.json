    "intro": "Senecio laramiensis, commonly known as the Laramie senecio, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in high-elevation areas of Wyoming and Colorado. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, dry habitats and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio laramiensis is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in open meadows and along rocky slopes."
