It typically features compact rosettes of small, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
