    "intro": "Salix brachycarpa var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, round female flowers that develop into woody, cone-like structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
