    "intro": "Solanum maroniense f. hexandrum, commonly known as the six-stamen nightshade, is a botanical variant of the species Solanum maroniense. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, particularly the presence of six stamens, which is a notable feature distinguishing it from the typical form. This plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to certain regions of South America. Its foliage consists of ovate to lanceolate leaves, often with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are typically white or pale purple, and the plant produces small, rounded berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste."
