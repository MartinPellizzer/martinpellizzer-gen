    "intro": "Sabulina macra, commonly known as the large sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
