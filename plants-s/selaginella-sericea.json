    "intro": "Selaginella sericea, commonly known as the silky spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern ally that typically grows in rocky crevices or on soil surfaces. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. Selaginella sericea is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
