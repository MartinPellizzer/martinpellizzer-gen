    "intro": "Selaginella meyenii, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a type of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a drought-tolerant species that can survive extreme desiccation by entering a state of dormancy. When rehydrated, it can \"resurrect\" by rapidly regaining its turgor and green appearance. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit and produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures. It is native to arid regions of Central and South America and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
