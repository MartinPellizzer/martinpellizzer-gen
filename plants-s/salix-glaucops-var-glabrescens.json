    "intro": "Salix glaucops var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a variant of the glaucops willow, characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in forested areas. Its catkins are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. The leaves are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
