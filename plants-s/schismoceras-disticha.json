    "intro": "Schismoceras disticha, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often emitting a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Schismoceras disticha is considered a vulnerable species."
