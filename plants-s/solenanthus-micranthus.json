It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a compact, bushy growth habit. Solenanthus micranthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
