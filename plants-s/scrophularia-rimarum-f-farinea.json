    "intro": "Scrophularia rimarum f. farinea, commonly known as the Farinean dog's mercury, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or reddish in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. This particular form is distinguished by its unique morphological traits, including the structure of its leaves and floral arrangement. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
