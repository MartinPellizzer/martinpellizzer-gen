It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
