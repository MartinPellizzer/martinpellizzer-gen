    "intro": "Sesbania dubia, commonly known as the slender sesbania, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Sesbania dubia typically grows as an annual or perennial shrub, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its adaptability and spread."
