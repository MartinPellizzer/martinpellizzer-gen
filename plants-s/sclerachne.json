    "intro": "Sclerachne, commonly known as the hardstem grass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its rigid, often hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in dry conditions. Sclerachne species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Their small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually inconspicuous, contributing to their role in local ecosystems."
