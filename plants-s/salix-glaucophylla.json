    "intro": "Salix glaucophylla, commonly known as the grey-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive greyish-white foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, fuzzy texture on both sides. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. This species is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
