It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant has deep roots that help in soil stabilization and nutrient fixation, making it valuable in agricultural systems. It is often used as forage for livestock due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. Additionally, it plays a role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soils."
