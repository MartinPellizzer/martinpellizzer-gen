    "intro": "Spiranthes ovalis var. erostellata, commonly known as the red-stemmed ladies' tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and wet meadows. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the species is pollinated primarily by flies and beetles. The variety erostellata is distinguished by its reddish stems and slightly different flower structure compared to other Spiranthes species."
