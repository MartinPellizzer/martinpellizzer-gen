    "intro": "Salix vestita, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Salix vestita is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
