    "intro": "Siphocampylus reticulatus var. hamatus, commonly known as the hairy nettle orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that have a distinctive reticulate pattern on the petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clay soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
