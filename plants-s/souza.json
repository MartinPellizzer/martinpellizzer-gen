    "intro": "Souza, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
