    "intro": "Sideroxylon thornei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The tree has a rounded crown and can grow up to 15 meters in height, with smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in clusters. Sideroxylon thornei is adapted to dry conditions and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
