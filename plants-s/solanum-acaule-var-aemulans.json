    "intro": "Solanum acaule var. aemulans, commonly known as the \"emulating nightshade,\" is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features a short, often underground stem and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant's leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
