    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 subdola, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a bluish-green hue on the upper surface and a silvery-white underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and along waterways."
