    "intro": "Sorbus subvestita, commonly known as the silverleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of bright red berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to flake in older trees. Sorbus subvestita is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
