It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Saxifraga camarae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
