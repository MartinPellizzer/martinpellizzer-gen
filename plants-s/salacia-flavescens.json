    "intro": "Salacia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species in its natural habitat."
