    "intro": "Spathodea speciosa, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a tropical tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is known for its rapid growth rate."
