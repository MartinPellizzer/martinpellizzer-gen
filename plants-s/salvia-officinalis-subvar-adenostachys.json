    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salvia officinalus subvar. adenostachys, commonly known as Greek sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to common sage. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Salvia officinalis."
