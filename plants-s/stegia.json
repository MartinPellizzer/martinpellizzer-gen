    "intro": "Stegia, commonly known as the \"velvetleaf,\" is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Stegia is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
