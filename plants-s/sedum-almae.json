    "intro": "Sedum almae, commonly known as the Alme sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically green and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Sedum almae is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to withstand drought conditions."
