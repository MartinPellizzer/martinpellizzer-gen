    "intro": "Selaginella brasiliensis, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a species of spikemoss native to South America. It is renowned for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a state of dormancy when dry and reviving when water becomes available. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. This resilient plant is often used in horticulture and is a subject of scientific study due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
