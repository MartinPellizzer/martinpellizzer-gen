    "intro": "Sarcolaena eriophora, commonly known as the African firecracker, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces bright red, tubular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss."
