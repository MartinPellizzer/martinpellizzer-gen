    "intro": "Schinus gracilipes var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions. The varietal form 'pilosa' distinguishes it from other Schinus species by its more pronounced hairy foliage."
