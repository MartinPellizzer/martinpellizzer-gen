    "intro": "Styrax rubifolius, commonly known as the red-leaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark red, fleshy berries. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Styrax rubifolius is valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
