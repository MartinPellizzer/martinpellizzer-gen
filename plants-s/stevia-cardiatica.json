It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is known for its high concentration of sweet compounds called steviol glycosides. Stevia cardiatica is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves, which are used as a natural sweetener. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both horticulture and herbal medicine."
