    "intro": "Senegalia coulteri, commonly known as the Coulter acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common species in desert landscapes. Senegalia coulteri is also valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and erosion control."
