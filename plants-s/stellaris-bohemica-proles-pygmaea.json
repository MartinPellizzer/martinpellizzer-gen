    "intro": "Stellaris bohemica proles pygmaea, commonly known as the Bohemian dwarf starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped blue or violet petals. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it one of the smallest members of its genus. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
