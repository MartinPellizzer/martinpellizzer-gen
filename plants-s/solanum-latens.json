    "intro": "Solanum latens, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features sprawling, trailing stems that can grow up to several feet in length, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in the evening. Its berries are initially green and turn red when mature, containing toxic compounds like solanine. Solanum latens is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
