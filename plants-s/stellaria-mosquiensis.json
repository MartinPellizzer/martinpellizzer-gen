    "intro": "Stellaria mosquiensis, commonly known as the mosquito starwort, is a small flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Stellaria mosquiensis is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
