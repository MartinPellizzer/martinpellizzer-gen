    "intro": "Selinum neglectum, commonly known as common wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and aromatic, finely divided leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Selinum neglectum is known for its strong, bitter scent and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
