    "intro": "Sporobolus cryptandrus var. strictus, commonly known as the rigid sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, dry capsules, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by wind. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and disturbed areas."
