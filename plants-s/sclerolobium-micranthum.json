    "intro": "Sclerolobium micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, which are a distinctive feature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Sclerolobium micranthum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
