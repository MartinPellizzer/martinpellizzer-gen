    "intro": "Sporobolus canovirens, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which are adapted for survival in harsh, dry environments. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. Sporobolus canovirens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
