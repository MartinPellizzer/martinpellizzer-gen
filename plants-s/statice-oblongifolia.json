    "intro": "Statice oblongifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and wind makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice oblongifolia is also cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and floral arrangements."
