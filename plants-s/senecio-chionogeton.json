It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
