    "intro": "Salicornia pusilla, commonly known as sea beans or dwarf glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a small, succulent annual or biennial species that thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes. Its stems are cylindrical and often covered in a layer of salt, which helps in excreting excess sodium. The plant produces small, green or red flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in capsules. Salicornia pusilla plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
