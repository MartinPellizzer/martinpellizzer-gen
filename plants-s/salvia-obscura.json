    "intro": "Salvia obscura, commonly known as the ghost sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and tall spikes of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Salvia obscura is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
