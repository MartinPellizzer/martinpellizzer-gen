    "intro": "Solanum anomalum var. cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or arid regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for cultivation in gardens or for human consumption."
