    "intro": "Stelis tropex, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically produces clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. Stelis tropex thrives in humid, warm climates and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
