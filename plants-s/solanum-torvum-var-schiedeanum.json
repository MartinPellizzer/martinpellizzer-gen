    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. schiedeanum, commonly known as the \"Cape gooseberry,\" is a tropical vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible when ripe, though they contain toxic compounds when unripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
