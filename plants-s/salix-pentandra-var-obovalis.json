    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. obovalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the broad-leafed willow native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard species. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks or wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, winged seeds for dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
