    "intro": "Sesuvium revolutifolium, commonly known as the coastal sandplum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and high temperatures. Due to its resilience, it is often used in coastal landscaping and as a hardy ornamental plant."
