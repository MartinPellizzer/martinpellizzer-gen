    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos irayensis, commonly known as the Madagascar starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are small, white or pink, clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
