    "intro": "Salix finalis, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, silvery down that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
