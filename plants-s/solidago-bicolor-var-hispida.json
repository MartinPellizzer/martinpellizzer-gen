It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow and orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a grayish-green hue. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in meadows and open woodlands. This variant is distinguished by its more robust growth and dense foliage compared to other goldenrod species."
