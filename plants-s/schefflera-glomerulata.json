    "intro": "Schefflera glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive and compact appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, attracting birds and other wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant indoors or in shaded outdoor gardens. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
