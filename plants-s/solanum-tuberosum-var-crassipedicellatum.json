    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. crassipedicellatum, commonly known as the thick-stemmed potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its robust, thickened stems and tubers that are often larger than those of the standard variety. This cultivar is native to the Andean region of South America, where it has been selectively bred for its unique growth characteristics. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its botanical traits make it a subject of interest for both agricultural research and horticultural display."
