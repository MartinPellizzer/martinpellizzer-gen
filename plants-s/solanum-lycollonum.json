    "intro": "Solanum lycollonum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
