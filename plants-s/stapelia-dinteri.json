    "intro": "Stapelia dinteri, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its leafless, fleshy stems that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with red markings. These flowers bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators like moths. Stapelia dinteri is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
