    "intro": "Sanguisorba sanguisorba subsp. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, often reddish stems and serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact size and attractive foliage."
