It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in cool and arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Scorzonera quitensis is also valued for its edible roots, which are used in traditional Andean cuisine."
