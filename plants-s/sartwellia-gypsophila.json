    "intro": "Sartwellia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on gypsum or limestone substrates. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sartwellia gypsophila is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
