It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy habitats. The plant is characterized by its round, fleshy fruits that resemble small globes, which are a key feature of its common name. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. Sphaeradenia occidentalis is often found in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
