    "intro": "Stellaster bohemicus, commonly known as the Bohemian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features delicate, star-shaped florets arranged in a radiate pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, Stellaster bohemicus is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
