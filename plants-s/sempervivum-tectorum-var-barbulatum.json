    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. barbulatum, commonly known as the Woolly Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly coating. The leaves are typically green or bluish-green, with a slightly crinkled texture that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. This hardy plant is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
