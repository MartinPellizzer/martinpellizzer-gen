It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Styrax cavaleriei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
