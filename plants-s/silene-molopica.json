    "intro": "Silene molopica, commonly known as the redstem sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as plains and rocky soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Silene molopica plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
