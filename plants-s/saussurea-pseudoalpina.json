    "intro": "Saussurea pseudoalpina, commonly known as the alpine saffron, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
