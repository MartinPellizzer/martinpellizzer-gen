    "intro": "Sida uchoae, commonly known as Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida uchoae is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
