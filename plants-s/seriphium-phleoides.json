    "intro": "Seriphium phleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a woolly texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Seriphium phleoides is often considered a weed but has ecological value by providing nectar for pollinators."
