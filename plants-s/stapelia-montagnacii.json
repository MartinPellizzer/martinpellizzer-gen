    "intro": "Stapelia montagnacii, commonly known as the mountain stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, such as flies, due to their strong odor. Stapelia montagnacii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
