    "intro": "Specklinia hastulata, commonly known as the lance-leafed fern. It is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Specklinia hastulata is valued in horticulture for its elegant, delicate appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
