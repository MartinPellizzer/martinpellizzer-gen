    "intro": "Schefflera subulata, commonly known as the needle-leaved umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-shaped clusters of dark green, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite and narrow, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Schefflera subulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
