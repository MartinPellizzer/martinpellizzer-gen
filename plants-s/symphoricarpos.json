    "intro": "Symphoricarpos, commonly known as snowberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the heath family, Ericaceae. These shrubs are characterized by their clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The fruit, which is typically white or red, is a type of berry that matures in the fall and is often eaten by birds. Symphoricarpos species are native to North America and parts of Asia, and they thrive in moist, acidic soils. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract wildlife."
