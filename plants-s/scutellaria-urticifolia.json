    "intro": "Scutellaria urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters. Its scientific name reflects its association with the stinging nettle genus, though it is not closely related. Scutellaria urticifolia is valued in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
