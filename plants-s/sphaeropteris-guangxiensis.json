    "intro": "Sphaeropteris guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi cycad, is a rare cycad species native to southern China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
