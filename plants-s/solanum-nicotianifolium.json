    "intro": "Solanum nicotianifolium, commonly known as the Nicotiana-like nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that resemble those of Nicotiana species. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, hard seeds. Solanum nicotianifolium is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
