    "intro": "Salsola seminuda, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are often used by wildlife. Salsola seminuda is adapted to harsh environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing food for desert animals."
