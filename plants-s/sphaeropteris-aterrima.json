    "intro": "Sphaeropteris aterrima, commonly known as the dark leathery cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish female cones and male cones that are typically hidden among the foliage. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
