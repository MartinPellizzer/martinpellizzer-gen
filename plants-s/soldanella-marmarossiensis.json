    "intro": "Soldanella marmarossiensis, commonly known as the Marmarossian snowbell, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and forested slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
