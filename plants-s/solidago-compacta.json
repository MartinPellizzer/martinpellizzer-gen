    "intro": "Solidago compacta, commonly known as the compact goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant produces dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. Solidago compacta is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
