It is a perennial wetland plant that thrives in marshy and aquatic environments. The plant features a tall, slender stem that often grows in dense clumps. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This form is often observed in disturbed wetlands and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
