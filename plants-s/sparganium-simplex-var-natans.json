    "intro": "Sparganium simplex var. natans, commonly known as the floating burr rush, is a herbaceous plant native to freshwater wetlands across Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, floating clusters of spiky, brownish-red fruits that remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant's stems are often submerged, with leaves that are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense mats. It plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late summer."
