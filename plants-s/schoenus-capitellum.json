    "intro": "Schoenus capitellum, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its structure and growth habits make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-poor conditions."
