    "intro": "Schizoglossum tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months."
