    "intro": "Saxifraga serpyllifolia var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Its adaptations to cold climates include a short growing season and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
