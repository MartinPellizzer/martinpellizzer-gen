    "intro": "Sedum keniense, commonly known as Kenyan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid environments. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Sedum keniense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
