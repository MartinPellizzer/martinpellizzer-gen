    "intro": "Symplocos nivalis, commonly known as the snowberry. It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a striking contrast to the snowy environment. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a slightly hairy texture. Symplocos nivalis is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing at high altitudes where temperatures remain low throughout the year."
