    "intro": "Sapium sublanceolatum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It has alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by orange to red drupes that contain a single seed. It is known for its rapid growth and is often used in reforestation projects. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora."
