    "intro": "Swainsona rostellata, commonly known as the desert bean or yellow trumpet, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Swainsona rostellata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing desert soils."
