    "intro": "Spiranthes macrophylla, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
