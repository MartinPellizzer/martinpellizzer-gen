    "intro": "Santiria multiflora, commonly known as the African star gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained soils. Santiria multiflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
