It features showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant has slender, arching branches and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long blooming period."
