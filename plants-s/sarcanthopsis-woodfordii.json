It is a member of the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Sarcanthopsis woodfordii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
