    "intro": "Sphaeropteris brunei, commonly known as the Brunei cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Brunei. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, providing insights into the evolutionary history of cycads. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
