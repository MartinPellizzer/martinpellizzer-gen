    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. nigrescens, commonly known as black nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features hairy, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into globose, black berries when mature. These berries are toxic to humans and animals but are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas."
