It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine, thread-like leaves, which contribute to its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, clustered flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Stenoloma capillaceum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
