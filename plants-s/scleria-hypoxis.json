It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a dense cluster, and it produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers in spike-like clusters. Scleria hypoxis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
