    "intro": "Strigosella latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf strigosella, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Strigosella latifolia is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
