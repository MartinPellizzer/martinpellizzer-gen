    "intro": "Saxifraga kusnezowiana, commonly known as the Kusnezow's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, appearing in late summer. It is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates."
