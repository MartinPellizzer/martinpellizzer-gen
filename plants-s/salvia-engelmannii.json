    "intro": "Salvia engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Salvia engelmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
