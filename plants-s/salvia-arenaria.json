    "intro": "Salvia arenaria, commonly known as sand sagebrush, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open grasslands and shrublands. Salvia arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various pollinators."
