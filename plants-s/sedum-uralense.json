    "intro": "Sedum uralense, commonly known as the Ural stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Sedum uralense is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
