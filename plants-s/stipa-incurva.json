    "intro": "Stipa incurva, commonly known as the bentgrass or curly grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curl inward. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Stipa incurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, feathery appearance."
