    "intro": "Stipa pampagrandensis, commonly known as the Pampas needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, bristly flowers. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, often forming dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its resilience in harsh conditions. Stipa pampagrandensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
