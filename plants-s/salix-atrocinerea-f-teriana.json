    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea f. teriana, commonly known as the black willow subspecies, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, often blackish bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its slender, drooping branches. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a rough, serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests."
