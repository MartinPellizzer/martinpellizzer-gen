    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. recurva, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit. It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, depending on environmental conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its sporophyte produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella rupestris var. recurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
