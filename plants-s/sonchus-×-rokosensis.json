    "intro": "Sonchus \u00d7 rokosensis, commonly known as the hybrid sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Sonchus arvensis and Sonchus oleraceus, characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various environments. The plant typically features serrated, rough leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spread and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Botanically, it is notable for its genetic variability and potential role in plant evolution through hybridization."
