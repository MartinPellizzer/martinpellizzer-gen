    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact flowering heads. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, lake margins, and wet meadows. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. This subspecies is adapted to temperate climates and plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
