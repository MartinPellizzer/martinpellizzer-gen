    "intro": "Schmidelia dioica, commonly known as the two-flowered schmidelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Schmidelia dioica is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological and morphological features."
