    "intro": "Salix myricoides var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along streambanks. The bark is often grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
