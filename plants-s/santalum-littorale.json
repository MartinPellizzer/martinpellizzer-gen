    "intro": "Santalum littorale, commonly known as the coastal sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown to black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. Santalum littorale is valued for its fragrant wood and is often found in sandy soils along the coastline."
