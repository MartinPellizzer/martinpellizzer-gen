    "intro": "Selaginella vanheurckiana, commonly known as the Vanheurck's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like structures called strobila. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are closely clustered, and it exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions through its desiccation-tolerant spores. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
