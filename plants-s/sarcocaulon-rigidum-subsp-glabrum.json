    "intro": "Sarcocaulon rigidum subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rock heath, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen foliage. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces dark, inedible berries. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
