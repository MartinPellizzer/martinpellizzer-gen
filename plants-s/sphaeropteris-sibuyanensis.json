    "intro": "Sphaeropteris sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan cycad, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Philippines. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and reproduces through seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
