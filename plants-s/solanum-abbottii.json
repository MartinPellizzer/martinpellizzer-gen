    "intro": "Solanum abbottii, commonly known as Abbott's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Texas and New Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and livestock, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. Solanum abbottii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
