    "intro": "Sarcococca trinervia, commonly known as the fragrant wintergreen. It is a dense, evergreen shrub native to China, characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ability to retain foliage year-round adds winter interest to the landscape."
