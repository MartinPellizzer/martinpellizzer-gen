    "intro": "Subpilocereus russelianus var. micracanthus, commonly known as the red-tipped night bloomer, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or red, which open at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and nocturnal blooming habit."
