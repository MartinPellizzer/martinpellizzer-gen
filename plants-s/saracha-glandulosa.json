    "intro": "Saracha glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular saracha, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, contributing to its ability to thrive in arid environments. Saracha glandulosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
