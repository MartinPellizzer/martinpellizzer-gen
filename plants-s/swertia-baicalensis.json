    "intro": "Swertia baicalensis, commonly known as the Chinese skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its most notable feature is the presence of yellow alkaloids in its roots, which contribute to its medicinal properties. Swertia baicalensis is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
