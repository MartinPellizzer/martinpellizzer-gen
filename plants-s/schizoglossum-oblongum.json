    "intro": "Schizoglossum oblongum, commonly known as the slender false flax, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Schizoglossum oblongum is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds, where it thrives with minimal water. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain desert animals."
