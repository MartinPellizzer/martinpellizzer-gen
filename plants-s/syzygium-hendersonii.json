It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The fruit is a drupe, typically reddish when mature, and contains a single seed. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas or on limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
