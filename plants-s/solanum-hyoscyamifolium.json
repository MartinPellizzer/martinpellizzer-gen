It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar species like tomatoes and peppers. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant of caution in both horticulture and natural environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
