It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
