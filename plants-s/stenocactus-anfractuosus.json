    "intro": "Stenocactus anfractuosus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, ribbed stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
