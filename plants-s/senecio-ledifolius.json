It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
