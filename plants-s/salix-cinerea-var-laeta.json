    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. laeta, commonly known as the white willow or silver willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its pale gray bark and slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, willow-like appearance. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its distinctive visual appeal. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used historically for its medicinal properties due to the salicin content in its bark."
