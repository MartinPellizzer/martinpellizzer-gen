    "intro": "Sporobolus clandestinus var. canovirens, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and glabrous, stiff blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, three-awned lemma-like structures. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed and dry soils."
