The species produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
