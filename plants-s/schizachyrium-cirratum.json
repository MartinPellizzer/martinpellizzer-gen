    "intro": "Schizachyrium cirratum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and dry woodland habitats. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall, and its slender, spike-like flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife. Schizachyrium cirratum is also valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
