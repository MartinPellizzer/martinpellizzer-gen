    "intro": "Solanum antisuyo, commonly known as the Antisuyo nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces berries that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of the Andes. Due to its limited distribution and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and ethnobotanists."
