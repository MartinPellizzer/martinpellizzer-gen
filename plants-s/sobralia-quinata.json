    "intro": "Sobralia quinata, commonly known as the Quinata Sobralia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of multiple fragrant, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, attaching itself to trees and using them for support rather than nutrients. Its leaves are usually elongated and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Sobralia quinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
