The plant features dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences at the base of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging, shaded garden conditions."
