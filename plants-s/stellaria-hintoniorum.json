    "intro": "Stellaria hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's starwort, is a small flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped white flowers and delicate, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
