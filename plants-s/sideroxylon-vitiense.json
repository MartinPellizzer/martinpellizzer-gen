    "intro": "Sideroxylon vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense Ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has a rugged, often twisted trunk and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a leathery texture, adapting to the humid, coastal environments where it thrives. Sideroxylon vitiense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
