    "intro": "Sphaerocoma, commonly known as the coastal sagebrush, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western coast of North America. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs with aromatic, often gray-green foliage. The plants typically have small, needle-like leaves and produce yellow or white flowers in clusters. Sphaerocoma species are adapted to coastal climates, with some varieties thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
