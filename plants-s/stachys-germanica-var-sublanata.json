    "intro": "Stachys germanica var. sublanata, commonly known as the hairy betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized areas."
