    "intro": "Solanum lidii, commonly known as the Liddi nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are toxic to humans but may serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, Solanum lidii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
