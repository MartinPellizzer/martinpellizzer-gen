    "intro": "Sagina arctica, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures remain low year-round. Sagina arctica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
