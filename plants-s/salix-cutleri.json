    "intro": "Salix cutleri, commonly known as the Cutler's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams. Due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
