    "intro": "Silene nutans var. majus, commonly known as the nodding catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene nutans var. majus is an annual species that completes its life cycle within a single growing season."
