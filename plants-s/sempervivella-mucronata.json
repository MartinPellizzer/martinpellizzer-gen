It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming low, rounded rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Sempervivella mucronata is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
