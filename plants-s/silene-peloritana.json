    "intro": "Silene peloritana, commonly known as the Peloritan Island catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal environment of its native habitat. Silene peloritana is considered a rare and endemic species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
