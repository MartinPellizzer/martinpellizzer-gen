It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish stems. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It is a hybrid between Stapelia gigantea and Stapelia hirsuta, resulting in a plant that combines traits from both parents. Stapelia \u00d7 sanguinea is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
