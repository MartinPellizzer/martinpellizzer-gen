    "intro": "Sporoxeia sciadophila, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sporoxeia sciadophila is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
