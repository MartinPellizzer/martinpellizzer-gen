    "intro": "Suaeda insularis, commonly known as the Socotra candelabra, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like structure with multiple branching stems that resemble a candle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in the arid environment. Suaeda insularis is also notable for its unique seed pods, which split open to release seeds when dry."
