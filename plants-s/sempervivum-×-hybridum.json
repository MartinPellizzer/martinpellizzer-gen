    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 hybridum, commonly known as the hen and chicken plant, is a hybrid succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and arranged in a compact, mound-like formation. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" which grow around the base of the parent plant, giving it its common name. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is well adapted to rocky and arid environments. Sempervivum \u00d7 hybridum is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
