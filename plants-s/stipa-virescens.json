    "intro": "Stipa virescens, commonly known as green feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or bluish-green in color, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands. Stipa virescens is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
