    "intro": "Senecio ganderi, commonly known as Gander's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Senecio ganderi is often found in open areas such as sagebrush steppe and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils."
