    "intro": "Stenogyne, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, often clustered flowers. The leaves are typically simple and opposite, with a leathery texture that helps the plant conserve water in its arid environment. Stenogyne species are known for their hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal and dry habitats. Many species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in Hawaiian ecosystems."
