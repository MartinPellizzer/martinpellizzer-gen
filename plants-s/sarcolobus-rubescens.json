    "intro": "Sarcolobus rubescens, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers with deep red veins contrasting against a pale pink or white background. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Sarcolobus rubescens is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
