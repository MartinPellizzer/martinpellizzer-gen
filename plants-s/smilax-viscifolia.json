    "intro": "Smilax viscifolia, commonly known as the sticky nightshade or swamp smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, often reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Smilax viscifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest floors, and it plays a role in providing food and shelter for wildlife. Its sticky sap and spines help deter herbivores, contributing to its survival in competitive ecosystems."
