    "intro": "Stellaria monosperma, commonly known as the starwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that are arranged in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Stellaria monosperma thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
