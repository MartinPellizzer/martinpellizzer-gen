It is characterized by its compact, pyramidal growth habit and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
