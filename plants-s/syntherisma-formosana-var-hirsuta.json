It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including hairy foliage and distinctive leaf arrangements. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
