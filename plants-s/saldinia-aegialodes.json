    "intro": "Saldinia aegialodes, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salt exposure. Saldinia aegialodes is an important plant for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
