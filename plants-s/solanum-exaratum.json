    "intro": "Solanum exaratum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring hairy, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum exaratum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and tolerate high temperatures. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
