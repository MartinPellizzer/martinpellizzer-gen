    "intro": "Styphelia foliosa, commonly known as the fairy moss or slender snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Styphelia foliosa thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
