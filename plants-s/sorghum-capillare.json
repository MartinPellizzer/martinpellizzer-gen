    "intro": "Sorghum capillare, commonly known as slender sorghum, is a warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sorghum capillare is often used for forage and has potential applications in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
