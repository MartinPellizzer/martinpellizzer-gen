    "intro": "Senegalia, commonly known as screwbean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia, and they are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Many species of Senegalia are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and pod-like fruits. They are adapted to withstand drought conditions, making them important components of desert ecosystems. Some species are used for forage, erosion control, or even traditional medicine."
