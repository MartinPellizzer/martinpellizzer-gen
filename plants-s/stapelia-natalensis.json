    "intro": "Stapelia natalensis, commonly known as the Natal carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and its unique, odoriferous flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces large, showy blooms in shades of yellow to orange, often with a strong, unpleasant smell to attract pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Stapelia natalensis is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its resilience and striking appearance."
