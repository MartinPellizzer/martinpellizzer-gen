    "intro": "Stanleya pinnatifida, commonly known as the white ghost flower, is a striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas with rocky soils and high elevation. The plant is characterized by its large, white, papery petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a fern-like appearance. Stanleya pinnatifida is known for its unique floral structure and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
