    "intro": "Silene lesbiaca, commonly known as the Lesbia's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, a common trait in the genus Silene. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
