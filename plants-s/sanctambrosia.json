    "intro": "Sanctambrosia, commonly known as the sacred balm, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in small, glandular dots. Its botanical name reflects its historical significance in herbal medicine and religious rituals. Due to habitat loss, Sanctambrosia is now classified as an endangered species."
