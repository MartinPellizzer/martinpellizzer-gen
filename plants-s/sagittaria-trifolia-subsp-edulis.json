    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia subsp. edulis, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender stems that support small, white flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in shallow water and tolerate a range of water conditions. Its rhizomes are edible and have been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples for food. The plant also provides habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
