    "intro": "Stenospermation ammiticum subsp. neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina mist orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the cool, misty conditions of its habitat. Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
