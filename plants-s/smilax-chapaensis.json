    "intro": "Smilax chapaensis, commonly known as Mexican catclaw, is a species of vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and thorny growth habit, which help it climb and support itself on other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with a distinct midrib. Smilax chapaensis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
