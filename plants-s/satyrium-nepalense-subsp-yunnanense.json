    "intro": "Satyrium nepalense subsp. yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan satyrium, is a species of orchid native to high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring a distinctive labellum with a complex structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
