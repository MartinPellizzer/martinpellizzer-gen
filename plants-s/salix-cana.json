    "intro": "Salix cana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its male flowers, and small, round female flowers that develop into woody, capsule-like fruits. Salix cana thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its bark and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine for their salicin content, similar to that of willow bark."
