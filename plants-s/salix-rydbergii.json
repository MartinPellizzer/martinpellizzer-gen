    "intro": "Salix rydbergii, commonly known as the Rydberg willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or bronze in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, clustered female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. Salix rydbergii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
