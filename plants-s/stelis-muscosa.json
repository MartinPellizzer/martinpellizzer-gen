    "intro": "Stelis muscosa, commonly known as the mossy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, branching growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures, which contribute to its unique appearance. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Stelis muscosa is often found growing on trees in tropical rainforests, where it relies on atmospheric moisture for survival."
