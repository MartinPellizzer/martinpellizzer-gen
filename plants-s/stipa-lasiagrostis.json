    "intro": "Stipa lasiagrostis, commonly known as silky needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine, silky texture. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Stipa lasiagrostis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
