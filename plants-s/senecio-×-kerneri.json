    "intro": "Senecio \u00d7 kerneri, commonly known as the hybrid ice plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to South Africa, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its drought tolerance. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
