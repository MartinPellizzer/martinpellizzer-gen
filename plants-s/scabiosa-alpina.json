    "intro": "Scabiosa alpina, commonly known as the alpine scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in a spherical or disc-like shape. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Scabiosa alpina is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
