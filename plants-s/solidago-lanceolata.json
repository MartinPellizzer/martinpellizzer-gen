It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It blooms in late summer to early fall, producing numerous small, composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Solidago lanceolata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
