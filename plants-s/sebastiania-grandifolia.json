It is characterized by its bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds.
