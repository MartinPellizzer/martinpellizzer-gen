    "intro": "Selaginella muscosa, commonly known as the lesser spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its whorled arrangement of tiny, needle-like leaves. It is characterized by its ability to produce spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella muscosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
