It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
