    "intro": "Spiraea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and seasonal color changes."
