    "intro": "Styrax limoncillo, commonly known as lemon-scented styrax, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
