    "intro": "Silene samothracica, commonly known as the Samothrace catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Greek island of Samothraki. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It has small, narrow leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene samothracica is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
