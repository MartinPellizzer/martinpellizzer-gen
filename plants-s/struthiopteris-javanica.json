    "intro": "Struthiopteris javanica, commonly known as the Javan shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that resembles a shield, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
