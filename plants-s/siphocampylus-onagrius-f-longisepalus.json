    "intro": "Siphocampylus onagrius f. longisepalus, commonly known as the long-sepaled willow herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically display a striking combination of white and pink hues. This variety is distinguished by its elongated sepals, which are more pronounced than in the typical form of the species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along streambanks."
