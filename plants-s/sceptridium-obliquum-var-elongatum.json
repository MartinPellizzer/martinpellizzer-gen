    "intro": "Sceptridium obliquum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated clubmoss, is a rare and endangered plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, creeping herb with slender, needle-like leaves that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate forests with acidic soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
