    "intro": "Sisymbrium album, commonly known as white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
