    "intro": "Sebastiania salicifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf sebastiania, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
