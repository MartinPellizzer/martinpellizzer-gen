    "intro": "Stipa subsessiliflora var. basiplumosa, commonly known as the slender false oat, is a grass species native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered and typically appear in dense, panicle-like structures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with glumes that are shorter than the lemmas, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
