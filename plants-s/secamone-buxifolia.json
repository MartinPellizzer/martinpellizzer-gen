    "intro": "Secamone buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf secamone, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
