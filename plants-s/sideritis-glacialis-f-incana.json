    "intro": "Sideritis glacialis f. incana, commonly known as the alpine ironwort, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps and adjacent areas. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its small, pale blue or purple flowers bloom in whorled clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and specialized alpine species."
