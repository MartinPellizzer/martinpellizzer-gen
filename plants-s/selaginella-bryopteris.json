    "intro": "Selaginella bryopteris, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme desiccation, a trait known as cryptobiosis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include microspores and megaspores, which are produced on specialized leaves called microsporophylls and megasporophylls. Selaginella bryopteris plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
