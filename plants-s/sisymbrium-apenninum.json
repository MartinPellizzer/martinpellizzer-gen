    "intro": "Sisymbrium apenninum, commonly known as the Apennine mustard, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in dry, sunny conditions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
