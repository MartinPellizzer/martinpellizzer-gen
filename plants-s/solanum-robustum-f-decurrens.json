It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into berries, which can be toxic if ingested."
