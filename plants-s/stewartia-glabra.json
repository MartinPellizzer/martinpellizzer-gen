    "intro": "Stewartia glabra, commonly known as the smooth Stewartia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Stewartia glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
