    "intro": "Sedum ecalcaratum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent leaves. Sedum ecalcaratum is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
