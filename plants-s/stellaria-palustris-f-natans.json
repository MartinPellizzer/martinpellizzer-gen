    "intro": "Stellaria palustris f. natans, commonly known as floating starwort, is a variant of the starwort plant that exhibits a unique aquatic adaptation. This subspecies is characterized by its floating habit, with leaves and stems that remain on the water surface rather than being rooted in soil. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that are typically clustered in star-like arrangements, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Stellaria palustris f. natans is often found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments."
