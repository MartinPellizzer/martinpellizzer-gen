    "intro": "Solanum styracioides, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by berries that change color as they mature. It is typically shrub-like in habit, with hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in wild or disturbed areas rather than cultivated gardens."
