    "intro": "Scilla hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Scilla hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize over time."
