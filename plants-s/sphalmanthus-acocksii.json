It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
