    "intro": "Solanum multiinterruptum, commonly known as the interrupted nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. It is a shrub-like plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into berries, which can be toxic if ingested. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
