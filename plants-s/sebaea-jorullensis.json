    "intro": "Sebaea jorullensis, commonly known as the Jorull\u00e9n sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features woolly, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically pink or purple, adding a delicate visual contrast to its foliage. Sebaea jorullensis is adapted to sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
