    "intro": "Struthiola pendula, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its stems are often prostrate or hanging, allowing it to spread across rocky surfaces or sandy soils. Struthiola pendula is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
