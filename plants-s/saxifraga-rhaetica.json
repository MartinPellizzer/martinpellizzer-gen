    "intro": "Saxifraga rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in mountainous areas such as the Alps and Carpathians. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in harsh environments. Saxifraga rhaetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
