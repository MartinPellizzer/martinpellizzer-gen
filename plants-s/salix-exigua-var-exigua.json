    "intro": "Salix exigua var. exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, showcasing its adaptability to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
