    "intro": "Salacia fugax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Salacia fugax is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
