    "intro": "Stravadium sarcostachys, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features hairy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
