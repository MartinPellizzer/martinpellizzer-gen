    "intro": "Salix glandulosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
