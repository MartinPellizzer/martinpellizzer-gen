These plants are characterized by their distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically arranged in clusters. Stellularia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They often grow in moist habitats such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while the stems are often prostrate or ascending."
