    "intro": "Salix nipponica var. mengshanensis, commonly known as Mengshan willow, is a rare variant of the Japanese willow native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in mountainous regions, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
