    "intro": "Spartina maritima subvar. fallax, commonly known as the European cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal mudflats and salt marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. This subvariety plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
