    "intro": "Scirpus cernuus var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical form of Scirpus cernuus. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters at the water's edge. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and wetland organisms."
