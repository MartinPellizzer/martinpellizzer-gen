    "intro": "Sesbania brevipeduncula, commonly known as the short-stemmed sesbania, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Sesbania brevipeduncula is often used in agroforestry for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
