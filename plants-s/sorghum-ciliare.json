    "intro": "Sorghum ciliare, commonly known as the silky sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains, which are often used for forage or traditional purposes. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Sorghum ciliare is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and landscapes."
