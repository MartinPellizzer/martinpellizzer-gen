    "intro": "Selaginella alutacea, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with spiral-arranged leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Selaginella alutacea is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
