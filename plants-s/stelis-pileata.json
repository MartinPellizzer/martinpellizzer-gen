    "intro": "Stelis pileata, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis pileata is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
