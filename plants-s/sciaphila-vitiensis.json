    "intro": "Sciaphila vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Vanuatu. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the wet season. Sciaphila vitiensis thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
