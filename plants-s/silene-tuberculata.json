    "intro": "Silene tuberculata, commonly known as the woolly catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Silene tuberculata is an important component of its native ecosystems and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
