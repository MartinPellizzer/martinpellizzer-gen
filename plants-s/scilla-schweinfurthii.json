    "intro": "Scilla schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or woodland habitats. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in gardens. Scilla schweinfurthii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators during the early growing season."
