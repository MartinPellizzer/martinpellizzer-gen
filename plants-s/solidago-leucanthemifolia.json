It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils in woodland or wetland areas, and it blooms in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering heads are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow phyllaries.
