    "intro": "Scleria polyrrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Africa and Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Scleria polyrrhiza is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
