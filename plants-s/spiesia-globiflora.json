    "intro": "Spiesia globiflora, commonly known as the globe-flowered spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle touch of color to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Spiesia globiflora is relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal water and maintenance."
