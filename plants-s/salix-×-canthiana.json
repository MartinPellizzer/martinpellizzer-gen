    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 canthiana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a serrated edge, and they turn yellow in the fall. The weeping willow is often planted for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to stabilize riverbanks and improve soil quality."
