    "intro": "Saldanhaea costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and dense foliage. The plant belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic trees such as laurel and cinnamon. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
