    "intro": "Silene joerstadii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada silene, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Silene joerstadii is adapted to high-altitude environments and is sensitive to changes in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
