    "intro": "Schismatoglottis gamoandra, commonly known as the giant panda plant, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, orchid-like inflorescences with pale green to white flowers, which are typically borne on long, erect stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Schismatoglottis gamoandra is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
