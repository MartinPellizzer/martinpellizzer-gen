    "intro": "Stipa speciosa var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf feathergrass, is a compact grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent in the summer months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
