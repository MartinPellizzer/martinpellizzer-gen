    "intro": "Selago lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Selago lanceolata is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
