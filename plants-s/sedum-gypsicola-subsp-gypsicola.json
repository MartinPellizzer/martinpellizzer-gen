    "intro": "Sedum gypsicola subsp. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soils, often found on rocky or gypsum-rich substrates. Its resilience to drought and high temperatures makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
