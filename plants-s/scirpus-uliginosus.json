    "intro": "Scirpus uliginosus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and its showy, spike-like inflorescence that appears in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus uliginosus plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
