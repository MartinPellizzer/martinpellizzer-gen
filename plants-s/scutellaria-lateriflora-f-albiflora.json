    "intro": "Scutellaria lateriflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. Its flowers are distinctive, featuring white petals with a blue or purple calyx, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is notable for its reduced flower color compared to the typical blue-flowered form of Scutellaria lateriflora."
