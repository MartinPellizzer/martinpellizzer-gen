    "intro": "Sparrmannia ricinocarpa subsp. ricinocarpa, commonly known as the red-stemmed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features erect, slender stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are lanceolate with a hairy surface. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long flowering period."
