    "intro": "Serratula uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sickleweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces a single, yellow flower at the end of each flowering stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Serratula uniflora is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to full sun and low moisture conditions."
