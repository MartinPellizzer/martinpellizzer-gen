    "intro": "Schoenoplectus smithii var. levisetus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along lake shores. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
