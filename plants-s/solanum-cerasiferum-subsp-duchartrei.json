    "intro": "Solanum cerasiferum subsp. duchartrei, commonly known as the dwarf cherry tomato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, cherry-like fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant features hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. This subspecies is distinct from the larger Solanum cerasiferum due to its smaller size and specific growth habits."
