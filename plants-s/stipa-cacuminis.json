    "intro": "Stipa cacuminis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. Stipa cacuminis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
