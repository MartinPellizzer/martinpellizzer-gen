    "intro": "Sagina haenkeana, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly sour taste, making it a traditional food source in some regions. Sagina haenkeana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
