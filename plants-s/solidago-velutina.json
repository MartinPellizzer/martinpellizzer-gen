    "intro": "Solidago velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils along stream banks, wetlands, and other damp habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Solidago velutina is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
