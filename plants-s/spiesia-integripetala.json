    "intro": "Spiesia integripetala, commonly known as the smooth-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically smooth and without notches or teeth. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
