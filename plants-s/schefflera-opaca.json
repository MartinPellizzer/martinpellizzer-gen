    "intro": "Schefflera opaca, commonly known as the Australian umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera opaca is relatively low-maintenance and adaptable to various indoor growing conditions."
