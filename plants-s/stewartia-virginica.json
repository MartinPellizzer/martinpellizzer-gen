    "intro": "Stewartia virginica, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant scent when cut. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. Stewartia virginica is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
