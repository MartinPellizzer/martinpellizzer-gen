It is characterized by its small, hairy stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. This species is known for its carnivorous tendencies, capturing small aquatic organisms in its specialized bladder-like structures."
