    "intro": "Strobilanthes paucinervia, commonly known as the \"Rafflesia-like\" or \"Carnivorous Rafflesia,\" is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, and often fragrant flowers, which can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant is known for its specialized symbiotic relationship with certain species of flies, which it attracts using its odor and nectar. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and are pollinated by these insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
