It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of small, spherical spores that are borne on short, branched stalks. The plant typically thrives in dry, saline soils and is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, allowing it to spread efficiently in open environments. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in various parts of the world."
