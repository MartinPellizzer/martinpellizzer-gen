    "intro": "Specklinia cypripedioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many regions."
