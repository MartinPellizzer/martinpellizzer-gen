    "intro": "Stevia lucida var. lucida, commonly known as the silver leaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is valued for its intense sweetness, as its leaves contain high levels of steviol glycosides. Due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for cultivation in arid or semi-arid regions."
