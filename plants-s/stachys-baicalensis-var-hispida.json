    "intro": "Stachys baicalensis var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy betony, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China and Russia. It is characterized by its upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers in whorled arrangements, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a slightly serrated edge. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
