    "intro": "Sisymbrium, commonly known as wild radish, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their cruciform flowers and often have a pungent odor due to the presence of glucosinolates. Sisymbrium species are typically annual or biennial herbs with hairy stems and alternate leaves. They produce pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. The genus includes several species, some of which are invasive in certain regions."
