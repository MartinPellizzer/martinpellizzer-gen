    "intro": "Synadenium carinatum, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, elongated fruit that resembles a horn, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The fruit is edible when young but becomes fibrous and less palatable as it matures."
