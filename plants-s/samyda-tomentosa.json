    "intro": "Samyda tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, grayish-white bark and heart-shaped leaves with a fuzzy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The woolly maple is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
