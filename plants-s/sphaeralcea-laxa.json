    "intro": "Sphaeralcea laxa, commonly known as the slender globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea laxa is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
