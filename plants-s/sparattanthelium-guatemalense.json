    "intro": "Sparattanthelium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan spathanthelium, is a rare grass species native to Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
