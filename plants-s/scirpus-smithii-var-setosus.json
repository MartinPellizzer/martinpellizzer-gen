    "intro": "Scirpus smithii var. setosus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. The hairy setosus variety is distinguished by its soft, hairy texture on the stems and leaves."
