    "intro": "Senecio fletcheri, commonly known as Fletcher's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert plains. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and summer, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets."
