    "intro": "Senftenbergia, commonly known as the Senftenberg lily, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Senftenbergia has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now critically endangered and protected in many countries."
