    "intro": "Stachys geobombycis var. alba, commonly known as white hedge nettle, is a variant of the hedge nettle species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative properties. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
