It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect culms that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and streamside areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a subtle, aromatic scent.
