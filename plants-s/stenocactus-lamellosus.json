    "intro": "Stenocactus lamellosus, commonly known as the ridged cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in prominent, rib-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by red or orange fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. Stenocactus lamellosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
