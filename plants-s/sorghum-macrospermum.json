    "intro": "Sorghum macrospermum, commonly known as the giant millet, is a tall, annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust stalks and large, coarse leaves, which can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces dense panicles of small, yellowish flowers, which develop into hard, spike-like seeds. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates and is often cultivated for its edible grains. The botanical features of Sorghum macrospermum make it a valuable crop for both food and forage in arid environments."
