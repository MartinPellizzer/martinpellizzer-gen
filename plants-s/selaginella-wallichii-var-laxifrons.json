    "intro": "Selaginella wallichii var. laxifrons, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the Himalayas. It features delicate, linear leaves that are often slightly curved and arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
