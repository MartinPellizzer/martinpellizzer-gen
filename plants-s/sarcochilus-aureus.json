It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and broad, leathery leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive golden beard-like structure on the lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss."
