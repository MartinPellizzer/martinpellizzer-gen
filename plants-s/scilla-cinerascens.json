    "intro": "Scilla cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers, which are typically blue to violet in color, bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant prefers well-drained soils and can be found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and early blooming habit."
