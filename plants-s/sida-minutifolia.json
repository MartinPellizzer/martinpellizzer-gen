    "intro": "Sida minutifolia, commonly known as smallleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length, giving it its common name. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round seeds. Sida minutifolia is often found in wetland ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils."
