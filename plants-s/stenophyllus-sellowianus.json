    "intro": "Stenophyllus sellowianus, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Stenophyllus sellowianus make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
