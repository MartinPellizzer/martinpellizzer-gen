    "intro": "Specularia speculum-veneris f. procumbens, commonly known as the Venus' Looking-Glass trailing form, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a unique, mirror-like appearance due to the reflective surface of its petals, which is why it is also called the \"Looking-Glass Plant.\" It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged blooming period."
