    "intro": "Stigmatodactylus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered stigmatodactylus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually large and colorful, with intricate petal structures that aid in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its natural range."
