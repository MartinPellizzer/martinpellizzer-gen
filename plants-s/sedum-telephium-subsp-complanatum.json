    "intro": "Sedum telephium subsp. complanatum, commonly known as the flatleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, flat, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
