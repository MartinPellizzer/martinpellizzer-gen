    "intro": "Smilax elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to grip and climb various structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its roots contain a latex-like substance, which has been used traditionally for its elastic properties. Smilax elastica is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
