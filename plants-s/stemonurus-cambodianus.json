    "intro": "Stemonurus cambodianus, commonly known as the Cambodian stemonurus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical regions of Cambodia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Due to habitat loss and limited research, Stemonurus cambodianus remains a poorly understood species with conservation concerns."
