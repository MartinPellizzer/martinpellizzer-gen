    "intro": "Solanum bradei, commonly known as the Brade's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its small, yellowish-green flowers develop into berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity and limited distribution, it is of interest in botanical studies but not widely cultivated."
