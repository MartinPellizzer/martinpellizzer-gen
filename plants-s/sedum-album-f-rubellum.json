It is a compact, low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and containers. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The flowering period usually occurs in summer, adding a splash of color to garden landscapes."
