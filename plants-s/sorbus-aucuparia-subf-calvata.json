    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subf. calvata, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other rowan species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have serrated edges. The smooth rowan is often found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and open areas, showing adaptability to various environmental conditions."
