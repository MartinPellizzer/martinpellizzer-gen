    "intro": "Salix glaucosericea, commonly known as the white-flowered willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are covered with a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
