It is characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions, posing a challenge for ecological management."
