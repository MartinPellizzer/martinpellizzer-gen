    "intro": "Silene hifacensis var. pseudogibraltarica, commonly known as the Gibraltar rock pink, is a rare and endemic species found in the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. It blooms during the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
