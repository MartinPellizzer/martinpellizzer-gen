It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its tall, narrow leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by wind. Scirpus thwaitesii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
