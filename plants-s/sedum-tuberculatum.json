    "intro": "Sedum tuberculatum, commonly known as the cushion sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and hardiness, Sedum tuberculatum is well-suited for xeriscaping and conservation gardens."
