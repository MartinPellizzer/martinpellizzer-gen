    "intro": "Streblus laevifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leafed sycoglossum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's adaptability to various soil types makes it a common species in tropical and subtropical regions."
