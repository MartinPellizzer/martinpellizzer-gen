    "intro": "Sida cordifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in moist or aquatic environments, and it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Sida cordifolia."
