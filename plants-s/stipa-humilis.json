    "intro": "Stipa humilis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fine, needle-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Stipa humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
