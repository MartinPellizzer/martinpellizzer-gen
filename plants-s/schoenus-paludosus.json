    "intro": "Schoenus paludosus, commonly known as the swamp grass or watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, thriving in saturated or waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and usually submerged or floating. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Schoenus paludosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
