    "intro": "Stenochloa californica, commonly known as the California grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Stenochloa californica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
