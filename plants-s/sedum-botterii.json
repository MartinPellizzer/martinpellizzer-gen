    "intro": "Sedum botterii, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often found growing on limestone or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
