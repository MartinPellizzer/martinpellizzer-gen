    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple elderberry, is a cultivar of the elderberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking purple flowers that appear in clustered inflorescences, typically in late spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can also be cultivated for its berries."
