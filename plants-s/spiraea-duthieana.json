    "intro": "Spiraea duthieana, commonly known as Duthie's weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
