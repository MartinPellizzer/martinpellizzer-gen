    "intro": "Smilax china var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a perennial climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features stout, thorny stems that can climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated margin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its persistent berries and architectural form."
