    "intro": "Salvia margaritae, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, providing a contrast to its colorful blossoms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Salvia margaritae is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
