    "intro": "Solanum integerrimum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. Solanum integerrimum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments."
