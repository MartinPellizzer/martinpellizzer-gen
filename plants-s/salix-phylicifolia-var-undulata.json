    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and narrow, serrated leaves that have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shady environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
