    "intro": "Sorbus meliosmifolia, commonly known as the Chinese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during spring, followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in mountainous regions. Sorbus meliosmifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
