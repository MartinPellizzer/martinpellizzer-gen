    "intro": "Sideroxylon dominicanum, commonly known as the Dominican wood or the Dominican ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
