It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms."
