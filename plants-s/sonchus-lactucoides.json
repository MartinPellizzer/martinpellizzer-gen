The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its milky sap that oozes from broken stems. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
