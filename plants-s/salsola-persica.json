    "intro": "Salsola persica, commonly known as Persian saltwort, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline and arid environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are extensive, allowing it to anchor in loose, sandy soils. Salsola persica is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats across Eurasia."
