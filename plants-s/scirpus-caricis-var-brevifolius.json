    "intro": "Scirpus caricis var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. It is also a valuable food source for waterfowl and other wetland wildlife."
