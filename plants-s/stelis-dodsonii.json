    "intro": "Stelis dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture from the air and rocks, adapting to its epiphytic lifestyle. Stelis dodsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
