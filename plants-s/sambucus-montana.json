    "intro": "Sambucus montana, commonly known as the mountain elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often used in jams and wines. Sambucus montana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
