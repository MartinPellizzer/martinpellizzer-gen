    "intro": "Strophanthus brevicaudatus, commonly known as the short-tailed strophanthus, is a striking climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and woody, vine-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care, as it contains cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals."
