    "intro": "Selaginella monospora var. ciliolata, commonly known as the ciliated spore moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature common in many primitive vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
