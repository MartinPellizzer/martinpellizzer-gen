    "intro": "Stipa platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa platyphylla is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
