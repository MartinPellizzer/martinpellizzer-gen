    "intro": "Stapelia humilis, commonly known as the African milk plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically green and fleshy, and it often grows in a shrub-like form. Stapelia humilis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
