    "intro": "Stenophragma thalianum var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bluebell, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low stature and ornamental appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile choice for various garden settings."
