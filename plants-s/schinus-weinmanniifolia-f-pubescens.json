    "intro": "Schinus weinmanniifolia f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy schinus, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-yellow, and it produces red drupes that are edible in some regions. The pubescent (hairy) foliage is a key feature of this particular form, distinguishing it from other varieties of Schinus."
