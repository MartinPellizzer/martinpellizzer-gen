    "intro": "Scilla obtusifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its intermediate morphology between the typical Scilla obtusifolia and other related species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in gardens and rockeries."
