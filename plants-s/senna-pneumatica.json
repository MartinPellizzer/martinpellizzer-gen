    "intro": "Senna pneumatica, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can grow up to 15 meters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are pinnately compound with serrated edges. One of its most distinctive features is its inflated, balloon-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant blooms and unique fruit structure."
