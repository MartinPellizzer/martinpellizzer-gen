    "intro": "Senegalia angustifolia, commonly known as screwbean mesquite, is a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Senegalia angustifolia is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
