    "intro": "Sabazia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are shrubs or subshrubs. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink. Sabazia species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
