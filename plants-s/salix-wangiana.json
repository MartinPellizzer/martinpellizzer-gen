    "intro": "Salix wangiana, commonly known as Wang's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically serrated along the edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
