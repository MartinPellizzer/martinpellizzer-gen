It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, green to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Salsola sieberi subsp. cyrenaica plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
