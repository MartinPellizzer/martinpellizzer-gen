It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and vibrant yellow-orange flowers that resemble sunbursts. The plant produces both ray and disc florets, typical of the daisy family, and has finely divided, grass-like leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Synurus excelsus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
