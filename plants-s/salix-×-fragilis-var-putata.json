It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found growing near rivers and wetlands. The plant is notable for its fragility, with branches that are easily broken, a trait that gives it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to its appearance. The white willow is also valued for its role in ecological habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
