    "intro": "Salix dolichostyla f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a distinctive ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. This cultivar belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-green underside, contributing to its striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that disperse easily by the wind. It thrives in moist soils and is often planted near water bodies for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
