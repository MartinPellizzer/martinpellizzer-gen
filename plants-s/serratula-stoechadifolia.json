It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround its yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastlines. Its structure is adapted to withstand strong sea winds and salt spray. Serratula stoechadifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
