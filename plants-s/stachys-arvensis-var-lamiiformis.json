It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its foliage has a mild mint-like aroma and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
