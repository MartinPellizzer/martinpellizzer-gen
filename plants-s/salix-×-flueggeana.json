    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 flueggeana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The weeping willow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
