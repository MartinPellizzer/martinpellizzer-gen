    "intro": "Saxifraga rocheliana subsp. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Dinaric Alps, particularly in Croatia. It is a perennial herb with fleshy, basal leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, calcareous habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
