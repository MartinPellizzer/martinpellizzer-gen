    "intro": "Styrax supaii, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of fragrant, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a unique, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy surface. Styrax supaii thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
