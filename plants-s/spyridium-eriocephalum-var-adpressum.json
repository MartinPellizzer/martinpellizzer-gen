It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glandular, hairy stems. The leaves are narrow, elliptical, and often have a blue-green coloration due to the presence of glandular dots. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. This species is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and sandy soils."
