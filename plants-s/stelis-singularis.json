    "intro": "Stelis singularis, commonly known as the singular stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, arranged in a raceme, and come in various colors such as white, yellow, and green. Stelis singularis prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
