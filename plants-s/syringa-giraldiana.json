    "intro": "Syringa giraldiana, commonly known as the Italian lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Syringa giraldiana prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy flowers and autumn foliage, though it is less commonly cultivated than other lilac species."
