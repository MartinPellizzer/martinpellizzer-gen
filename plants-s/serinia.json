    "intro": "Serinia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. Serinia species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant's adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
