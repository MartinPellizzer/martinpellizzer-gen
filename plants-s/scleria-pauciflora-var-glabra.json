    "intro": "Scleria pauciflora var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-flowered bulbous sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are smooth and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
