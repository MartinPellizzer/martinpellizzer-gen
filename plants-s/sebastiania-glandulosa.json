    "intro": "Sebastiania glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky-seed tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, sticky, orange-red berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The glandular structures on its leaves and fruits are thought to play a role in deterring herbivores and aiding in seed dispersal."
