    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor var. verrucosa, commonly known as the hairy or woolly sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
