    "intro": "Sorindeia africana var. lastoursvillensis, commonly known as the Lastoursville sorindeia, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
