    "intro": "Selenodesmium guineense, commonly known as the African water fern, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to the stabilization of aquatic habitats. Selenodesmium guineense plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides shelter for small aquatic organisms."
