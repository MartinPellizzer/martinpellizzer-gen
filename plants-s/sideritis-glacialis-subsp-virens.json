    "intro": "Sideritis glacialis subsp. virens, commonly known as the alpine ironwort, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
