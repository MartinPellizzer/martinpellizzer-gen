It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces elongated, tuberous roots that are often harvested for their edible qualities. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Scorzonera macrocephala is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
