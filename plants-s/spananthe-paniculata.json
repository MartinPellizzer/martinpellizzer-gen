It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often resemble panthers due to their dark, spotted patterns. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.

Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
