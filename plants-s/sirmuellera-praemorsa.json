It is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it unpalatable to herbivores. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique floral structure."
