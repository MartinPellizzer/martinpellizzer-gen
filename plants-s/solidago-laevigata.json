    "intro": "Solidago laevigata, commonly known as smooth goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly rough texture. Smooth goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
