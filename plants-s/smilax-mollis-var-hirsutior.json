    "intro": "Smilax mollis var. hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in dense, reddish-brown hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its berries are dark purple when mature and are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The plant is often found in moist woodlands and thickets, where it climbs or spreads along the ground."
