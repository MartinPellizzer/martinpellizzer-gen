    "intro": "Sceletium tortuosum, commonly known as kanna, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sceletium tortuosum has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for its psychoactive properties and calming effects."
