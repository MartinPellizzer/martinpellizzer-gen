    "intro": "Senecio psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-loving groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
