    "intro": "Scirpus cernuus f. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its diminutive size, compared to the standard Scirpus cernuus, makes it well-suited for small wetland habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
