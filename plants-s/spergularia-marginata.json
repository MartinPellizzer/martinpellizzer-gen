    "intro": "Spergularia marginata, commonly known as seaside sandspit, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is typically found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, pinkish or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. Spergularia marginata is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. Its ability to thrive in such conditions makes it an important indicator of coastal ecological health."
