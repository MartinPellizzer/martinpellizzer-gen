    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of Europe and Siberia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and woodland areas. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit make it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and shady borders."
