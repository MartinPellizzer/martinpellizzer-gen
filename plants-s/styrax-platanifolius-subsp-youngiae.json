    "intro": "Styrax platanifolius subsp. youngiae, commonly known as the Chinese styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are glossy and emit a pleasant fragrance when crushed. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, reddish-brown berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Styrax platanifolius."
