    "intro": "Salix arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Salix arbuscula typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
