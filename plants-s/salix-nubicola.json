    "intro": "Salix nubicola, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and its distinctive, willow-like leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to reddish in color, appearing in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought. Salix nubicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
