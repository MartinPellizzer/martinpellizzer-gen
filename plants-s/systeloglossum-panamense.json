    "intro": "Systeloglossum panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often with a pale or translucent appearance. The plant typically grows on tree branches or in shaded, humid environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat destruction and limited research, Systeloglossum panamense remains a poorly understood and endangered species."
