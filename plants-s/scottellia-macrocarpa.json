    "intro": "Scottellia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited scottellia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its fruits are distinctive, being large, dry, and three-lobed, with a hairy surface. Scottellia macrocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
