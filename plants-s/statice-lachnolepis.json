    "intro": "Statice lachnolepis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, colorful flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice lachnolepis is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and visual appeal."
