    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. biserrata, commonly known as the serrated rowan, is a botanical variant of the common rowan tree. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from the typical smooth-edged leaves of the parent species. The plant produces small, red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
