    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 phaeophylla, commonly known as the black willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy underneath. This plant typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. The black willow is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
