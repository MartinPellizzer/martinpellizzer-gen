    "intro": "Sorbus caucasigena f. terminalidenticulata, commonly known as the Caucasian whitebeam, is a rare and unique variant of the whitebeam species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its distinctive terminal clusters of small, white flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin and a pale underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
