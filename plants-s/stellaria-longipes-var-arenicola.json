    "intro": "Stellaria longipes var. arenicola, commonly known as the sandstar chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variant is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandy habitats."
