    "intro": "Syzygium verniciflorum, commonly known as the lac tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It is particularly valued for its sap, which is used to produce natural lac, a substance used in varnishes and industrial applications. The plant is also important in traditional medicine and local ecosystems."
