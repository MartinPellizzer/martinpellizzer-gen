    "intro": "Seridia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf seridia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, often in shades of red or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
