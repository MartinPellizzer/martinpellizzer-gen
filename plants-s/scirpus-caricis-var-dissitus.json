It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
