    "intro": "Solanum rixosum, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching structure, hairy stems, and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that mature to a dark purple color, often containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
