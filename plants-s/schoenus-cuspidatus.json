    "intro": "Schoenus cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. Schoenus cuspidatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
