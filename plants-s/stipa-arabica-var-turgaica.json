    "intro": "Stipa arabica var. turgaica, commonly known as the Turgica needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
