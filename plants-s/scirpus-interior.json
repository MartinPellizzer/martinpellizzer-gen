    "intro": "Scirpus interior, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features erect, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of the stem, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Scirpus interior is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
