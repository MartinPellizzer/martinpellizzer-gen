    "intro": "Strobilanthes prahuensis, commonly known as the Pahang flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the understory layer of tropical rainforests. Its flowering period is usually during the wet season, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
