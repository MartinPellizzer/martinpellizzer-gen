    "intro": "Schiedeella stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous schiedeella, is a unique member of the Schiedeellaceae family. It is a perennial, mat-forming plant characterized by its creeping stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Schiedeella stolonifera is native to parts of Australia and is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils."
