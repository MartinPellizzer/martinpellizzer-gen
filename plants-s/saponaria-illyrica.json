    "intro": "Saponaria illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Saponaria illyrica contains saponins, which give it its name and make it useful in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
