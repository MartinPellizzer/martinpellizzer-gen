    "intro": "Schedonorus divaricatus, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinged inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent in the summer months. Schedonorus divaricatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
