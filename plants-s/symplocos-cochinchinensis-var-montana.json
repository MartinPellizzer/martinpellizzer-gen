    "intro": "Symplocos cochinchinensis var. montana, commonly known as mountain symplocos, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in secondary forests and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
