    "intro": "Symplocos ampulliformis, commonly known as the bladderleaf inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive bladder-like berries that turn red when mature. These berries are edible but are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans. Symplocos ampulliformis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland understories."
