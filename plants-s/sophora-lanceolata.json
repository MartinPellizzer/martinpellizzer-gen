    "intro": "Sophora lanceolata, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a lanceolate shape. The plant produces striking, pendulous clusters of violet-blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Sophora lanceolata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
