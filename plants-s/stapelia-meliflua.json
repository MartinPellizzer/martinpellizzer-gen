    "intro": "Stapelia meliflua, commonly known as the honey-scented stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange with a strong, sweet fragrance. These flowers open in the evening and emit a scent reminiscent of honey, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Stapelia meliflua is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
