    "intro": "Sporobolus viscidus, commonly known as sticky spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and sticky, hairy surfaces on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
