    "intro": "Stephania dinklagei var. axillaris, commonly known as the axillary stephania, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Menispermaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in axillary positions, giving it its varietal name. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range."
