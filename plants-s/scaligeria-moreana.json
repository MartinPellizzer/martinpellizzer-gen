It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are arranged in dense, terminal spikes, adding a delicate appearance to the plant.
