    "intro": "Schoenoplectus vohemarensis, commonly known as the Vohemare sedge, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Madagascar. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Schoenoplectus vohemarensis plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
