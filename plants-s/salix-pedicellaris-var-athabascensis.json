    "intro": "Salix pedicellaris var. athabascensis, commonly known as the Athabaskan willow, is a shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of lakes and rivers. This variant is adapted to cold climates and plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
