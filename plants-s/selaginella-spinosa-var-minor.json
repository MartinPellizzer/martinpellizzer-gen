    "intro": "Selaginella spinosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spinous spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are often clustered in tight, spiral arrangements around its stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
