    "intro": "Stenogastra, commonly known as the \"false arrowhead,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes, giving them a distinctive appearance. Stenogastra species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often pale yellow or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
