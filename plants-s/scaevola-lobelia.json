    "intro": "Scaevola lobelia, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Scaevola lobelia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
