    "intro": "Sticherus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in spring and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sticherus hispidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
