    "intro": "Saccharum contractum, commonly known as the dwarf sugarcane. It is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other sugarcane varieties. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in wetland environments. Its stems are thick and juicy, containing high concentrations of sucrose, making it valuable for sugar production. However, due to its smaller size, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial sugarcane farming."
