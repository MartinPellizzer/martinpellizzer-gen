    "intro": "Smilax subinermis, commonly known as the prickly pear, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which help it to climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for humans and animals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species. Smilax subinermis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
