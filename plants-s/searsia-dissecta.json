    "intro": "Searsia dissecta, commonly known as the white stinkwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves that are often deeply lobed or dissected. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
