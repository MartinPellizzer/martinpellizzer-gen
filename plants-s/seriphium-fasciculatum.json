It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.
