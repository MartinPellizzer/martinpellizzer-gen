    "intro": "Sclerococcus lineatus, commonly known as the lineated scalebug, is a small, armored scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated body covered in a waxy, shield-like covering. The plant it infests is typically a woody shrub or tree, where it feeds on sap from the phloem tissue. Its presence can lead to yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and in severe cases, plant death. Due to its cryptic appearance, it is often difficult to detect without close inspection."
