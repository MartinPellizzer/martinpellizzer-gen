    "intro": "Solanum setulosistylum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in clusters. Its fruits are berries that can vary in color from green to red, depending on maturity. Like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains alkaloids, which can make it toxic if ingested."
