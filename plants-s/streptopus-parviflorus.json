    "intro": "Streptopus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale blue, during the spring months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Streptopus parviflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
