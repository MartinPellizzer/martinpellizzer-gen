    "intro": "Salix scrupea, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, often clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the growing season. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
