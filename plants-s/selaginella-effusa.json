    "intro": "Selaginella effusa, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella effusa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
