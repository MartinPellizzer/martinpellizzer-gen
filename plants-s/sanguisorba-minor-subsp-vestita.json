    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor subsp. vestita, commonly known as the white dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, silver-velvet leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, spikelike inflorescences bearing small, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
