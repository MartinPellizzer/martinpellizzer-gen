It features elongated, tubular leaves that form specialized pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with a distinctive white or yellow stripe, enhancing their visual appeal. These plants thrive in moist, acidic soils and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.
