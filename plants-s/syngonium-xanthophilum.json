    "intro": "Syngonium xanthophilum, commonly known as the golden arrow plant, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow or gold, with a striking contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Syngonium xanthophilum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
