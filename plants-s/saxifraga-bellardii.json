    "intro": "Saxifraga bellardii, commonly known as the bellard's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the summer months. It is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga bellardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
