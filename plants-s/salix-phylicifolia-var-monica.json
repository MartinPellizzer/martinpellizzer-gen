    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. monica, commonly known as the Monica willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and wetlands. This variety is valued for its aesthetic qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
