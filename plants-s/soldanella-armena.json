    "intro": "Soldanella armena, commonly known as Armenian sandparsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the development of small, oval-shaped seeds. Soldanella armena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
