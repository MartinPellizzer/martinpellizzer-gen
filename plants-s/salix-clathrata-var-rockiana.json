    "intro": "Salix clathrata var. rockiana, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid or semi-arid environments."
