    "intro": "Streptoloma, commonly known as the bead lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bead-like flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral or clustered pattern. The plants are native to various regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Streptoloma species often grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Their ornamental value has made them popular in horticulture, though they are not widely cultivated outside their native habitats."
