    "intro": "Sedum haematodeum, commonly known as bloodstone, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions due to its thick, water-storing leaves. The name \"bloodstone\" refers to the reddish hues in its leaves, which resemble blood."
