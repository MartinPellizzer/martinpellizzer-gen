    "intro": "Salix foliosa, commonly known as the leafy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Salix foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
