    "intro": "Spirodela pusilla, commonly known as the water shield, is a small, floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It has broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically submerged, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Spirodela pusilla is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
