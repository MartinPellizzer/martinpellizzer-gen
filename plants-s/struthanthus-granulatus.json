    "intro": "Struthanthus granulatus, commonly known as the granulate globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, sparsely hairy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low, mat-forming growth habit with thick, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in small, granular protrusions. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems, and the plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Struthanthus granulatus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas."
