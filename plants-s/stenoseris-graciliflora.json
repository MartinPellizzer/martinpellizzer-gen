It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its slender, elongated leaves and small, daisy-like flowers make it distinctive in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
