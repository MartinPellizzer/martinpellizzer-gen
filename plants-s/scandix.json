    "intro": "Scandix, commonly known as sweetroot, is a biennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its root is thick, fleshy, and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Scandix thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
