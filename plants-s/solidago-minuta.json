    "intro": "Solidago minuta, commonly known as dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender, branching stems covered in small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Solidago minuta plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
