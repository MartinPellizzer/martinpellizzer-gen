    "intro": "Sansevieria powellii, commonly known as the Powell's snake plant, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features long, narrow, upright leaves that are typically a deep green with prominent, light green or white variegation. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stalks, which appear in the spring. This plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in low-light environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
