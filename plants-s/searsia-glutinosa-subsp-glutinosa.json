It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are sticky to the touch due to a resinous substance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
