It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, adapted to the dry, rocky environments where it typically grows. Stenostephanus cleefii is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
