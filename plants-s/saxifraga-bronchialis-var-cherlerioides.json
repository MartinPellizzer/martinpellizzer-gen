It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
