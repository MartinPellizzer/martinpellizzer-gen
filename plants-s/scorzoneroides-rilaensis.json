    "intro": "Scorzoneroides rilaensis, commonly known as the Rila scorzonera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Rila Mountains in Bulgaria. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth form, which help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation interest."
