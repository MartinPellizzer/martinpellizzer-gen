It features hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
