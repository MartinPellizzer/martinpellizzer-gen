    "intro": "Styloglossum microglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a unique lichen species that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically thin and leaf-like in appearance. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, enabling it to thrive in various habitats. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of air quality."
