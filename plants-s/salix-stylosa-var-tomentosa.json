    "intro": "Salix stylosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray pubescent leaves and catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. Its botanical features include a slender, multi-stemmed structure with alternate, ovate leaves. The woolly willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
