    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata var. kotulae, commonly known as the Kotula's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
