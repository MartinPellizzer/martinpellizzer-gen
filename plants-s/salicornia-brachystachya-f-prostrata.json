    "intro": "Salicornia brachystachya f. prostrata, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that forms dense mats on coastal shores and salt marshes. The plant produces small, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a crust of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
