    "intro": "Salix dolabrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically broader than they are long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and tundra environments. Salix dolabrifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
