    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. puberula, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
