    "intro": "Spergularia marina var. cleistogama, commonly known as the coastal sand spurry, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, some of which are cleistogamous, meaning they open only internally without pollination by insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in estuarine and tidal zones. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal vegetation communities."
