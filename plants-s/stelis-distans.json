    "intro": "Stelis distans, commonly known as the distant orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. The orchid's delicate structure and unique flowering pattern make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
