    "intro": "Solidago glaberrima, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Solidago glaberrima is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
