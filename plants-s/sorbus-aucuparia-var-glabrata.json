    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other rowan species. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges. The smooth rowan is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
