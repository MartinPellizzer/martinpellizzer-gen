    "intro": "Senites haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian senita, is a succulent plant native to the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, ribbed stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to habitat loss, Senites haitiensis is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
