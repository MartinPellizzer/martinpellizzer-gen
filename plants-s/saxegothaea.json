    "intro": "Saxegothaea, commonly known as the Alaska cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Saxegothaea thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in coastal rainforests. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
