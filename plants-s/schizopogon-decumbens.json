    "intro": "Schizopogon decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. Schizopogon decumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
