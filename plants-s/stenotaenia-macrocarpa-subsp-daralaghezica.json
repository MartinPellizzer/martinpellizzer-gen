    "intro": "Stenotaenia macrocarpa subsp. daralaghezica, commonly known as the Daralaghezic sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
