It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
