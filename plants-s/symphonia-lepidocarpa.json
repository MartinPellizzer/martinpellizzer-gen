    "intro": "Symphonia lepidocarpa, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in construction and furniture-making. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
