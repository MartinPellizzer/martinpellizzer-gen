    "intro": "Sinapi, commonly known as mustard, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters, with hairy stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, dry fruit called a siliqua, which splits open to release the seeds. Sinapi is widely cultivated for its seeds, which are used to make mustard oil and condiments."
