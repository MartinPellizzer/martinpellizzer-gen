It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water. The plant produces small, green to red flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats. Its morphology and physiology make it an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
