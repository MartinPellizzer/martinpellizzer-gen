    "intro": "Saxifraga pasumensis f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
