    "intro": "Seruneum ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Seruneum ehrenbergii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in native plant gardens."
