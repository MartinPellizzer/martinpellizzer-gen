    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
