    "intro": "Sorbus macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits called pomes. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Sorbus macrantha is valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
