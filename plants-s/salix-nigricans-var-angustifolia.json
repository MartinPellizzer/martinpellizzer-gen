    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a serrated edge. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
