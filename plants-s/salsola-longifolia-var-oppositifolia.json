    "intro": "Salsola longifolia var. oppositifolia, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with branched stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered with a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that aids in water retention. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures."
