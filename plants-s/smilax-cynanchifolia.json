    "intro": "Smilax cynanchifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which help protect it from herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically arrowhead-shaped, hence its common name, and are often used in traditional medicine. Smilax cynanchifolia thrives in woodland habitats and is known for its hardy, persistent growth."
