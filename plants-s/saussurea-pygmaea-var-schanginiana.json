    "intro": "Saussurea pygmaea var. schanginiana, commonly known as the dwarf saussurea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold and dry conditions. The plant features a short, fibrous root system and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
