    "intro": "Sporadanthus caudatus, commonly known as the Cape barbed wire plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange ray flowers surrounded by numerous tubular florets. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Sporadanthus caudatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
