It is characterized by its large, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a popular ornamental species. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces fruit that splits open to reveal seeds with silky filaments. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
