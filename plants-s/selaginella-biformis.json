    "intro": "Selaginella biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a terrestrial, evergreen, and spore-bearing plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a creeping stem with upright, spirally arranged leaves that are often divided into two lobes. It produces strobila (spore cones) at the tips of its stems, which are used for reproduction. Selaginella biformis is adapted to survive in harsh environments due to its ability to retain water and resist desiccation."
