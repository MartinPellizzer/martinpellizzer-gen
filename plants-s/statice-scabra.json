    "intro": "Statice scabra, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, tightly packed blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes or along shorelines. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Statice scabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
