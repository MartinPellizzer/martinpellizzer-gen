It is characterized by its striking purple-colored fruits, which are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the standard eggplant. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typical of the Solanaceae family. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine layer of pubescence. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its visual interest."
