    "intro": "Suaeda corniculata var. erecta, commonly known as the upright saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh, coastal environments. Its erect growth habit and dense foliage help it resist wind and water erosion. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
