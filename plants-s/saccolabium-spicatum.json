    "intro": "Saccolabium spicatum, commonly known as the spiked saccolabium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and spiny pods. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with grayish-green foliage adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale yellow, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Saccolabium spicatum plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
