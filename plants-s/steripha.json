    "intro": "Steripha, commonly known as the \"sacred fern,\" is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that often form a rosette shape. The plant typically has four to eight leaflets arranged in a cross shape, which helps it float on water surfaces. Steripha species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
