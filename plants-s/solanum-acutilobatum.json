    "intro": "Solanum acutilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are ovate with sharply pointed lobes, and the plant often grows in rocky or arid environments. Solanum acutilobatum is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity limits its widespread use."
