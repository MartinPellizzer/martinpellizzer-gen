    "intro": "Salvia subsessilis, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia subsessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
