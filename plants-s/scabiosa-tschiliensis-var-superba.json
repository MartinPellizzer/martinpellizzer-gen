    "intro": "Scabiosa tschiliensis var. superba, commonly known as the mountain scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine beds. Its delicate appearance and extended blooming period make it a valuable addition to ornamental gardens."
