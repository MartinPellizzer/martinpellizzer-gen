    "intro": "Saxifraga flavida, commonly known as the yellow saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures. Saxifraga flavida is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
