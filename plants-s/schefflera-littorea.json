    "intro": "Schefflera littorea, commonly known as the coastal schefflera, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often borne on short, hairy peduncles. It thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Schefflera littorea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
