    "intro": "Sophora chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves, which are finely divided and give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in late spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
