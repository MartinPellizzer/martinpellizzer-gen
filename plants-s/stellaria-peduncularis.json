    "intro": "Stellaria peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense clusters of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Stellaria peduncularis thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
