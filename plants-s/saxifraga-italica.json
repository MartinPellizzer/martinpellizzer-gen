    "intro": "Saxifraga italica, commonly known as the Italian rockfoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom. It produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga italica is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
