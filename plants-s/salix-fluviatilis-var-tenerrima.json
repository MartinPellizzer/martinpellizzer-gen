    "intro": "Salix fluviatilis var. tenerrima, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it a common indicator species for riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
