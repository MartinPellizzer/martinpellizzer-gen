    "intro": "Sabina wallichiana var. meionocarpa, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese juniper, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas. It features scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense, flattened sprays. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue, adding ornamental value in the winter. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a foundation plant due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. The variety is noted for its compact form and ability to thrive in a range of soil types once established."
