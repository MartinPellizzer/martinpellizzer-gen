    "intro": "Salmea scandens var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf climbing salmea, is a variant of the species Salmea scandens, which is native to certain regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its climbing habit and broad, obtuse leaves that give it its botanical name. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
