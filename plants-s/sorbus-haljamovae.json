    "intro": "Sorbus haljamovae, commonly known as the Haljamovae whitebeam, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is typically found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils, growing at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
