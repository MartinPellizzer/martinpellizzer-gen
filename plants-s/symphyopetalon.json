    "intro": "Symphyopetalon, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae, is characterized by its unique floral structure. The genus includes species that are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions. One of the most notable botanical features is the presence of sympetalous petals, which are fused at the base to form a tube-like structure. These plants often have showy flowers with five or more petals that are joined in a way that enhances pollination by insects. Additionally, the leaves are usually palmately lobed, contributing to their ornamental value in horticulture."
