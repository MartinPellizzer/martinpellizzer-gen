    "intro": "Solanum aculeatissimum, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to berries that change color from green to red as they mature. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
