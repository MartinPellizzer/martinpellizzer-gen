    "intro": "Salsola spinosa, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is an annual or biennial herb characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Salsola spinosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in arid environments."
