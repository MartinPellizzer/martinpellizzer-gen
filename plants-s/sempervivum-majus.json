It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green or variegated with white or pink markings. The plant produces tall flowering stalks in late summer, bearing small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a wide range of climates, including cold winters."
