    "intro": "Schiedeella chartacea, commonly known as the paperbark tree, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that peels off in thin, papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by edible, black, spherical berries. Schiedeella chartacea is often found in coastal and wetland habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
