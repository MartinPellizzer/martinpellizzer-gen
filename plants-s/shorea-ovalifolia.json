    "intro": "Shorea ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf durian, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the petiole. The tree produces fragrant flowers and develops large, spiky fruits similar to the durian, though it is less commonly cultivated for its fruit. Its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it important in local timber industries. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats, supporting diverse flora and fauna."
