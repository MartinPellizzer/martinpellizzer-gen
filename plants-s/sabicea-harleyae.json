    "intro": "Sabicea harleyae, commonly known as the Harley's sabicea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as the understory of tropical rainforests. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
