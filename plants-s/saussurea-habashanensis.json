    "intro": "Saussurea habashanensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian saffron, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellowish-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, inconspicuous florets arranged in a composite flower head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
