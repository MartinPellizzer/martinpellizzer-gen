    "intro": "Stichorkis gautierensis, commonly known as the Gautier's stichorkis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features include hairy stems and yellowish-orange petals that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
