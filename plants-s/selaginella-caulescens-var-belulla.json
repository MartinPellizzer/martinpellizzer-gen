    "intro": "Selaginella caulescens var. belulla, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely packed, scale-like leaves and a short, upright stem. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on specialized structures called strobila. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
