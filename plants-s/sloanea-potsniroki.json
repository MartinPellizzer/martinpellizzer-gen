    "intro": "Sloanea potsniroki, commonly known as the rare mountain sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale yellow in color. Sloanea potsniroki is known for its slow growth rate and preference for cool, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
