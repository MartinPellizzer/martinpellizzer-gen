    "intro": "Scirpus nervosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus nervosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
