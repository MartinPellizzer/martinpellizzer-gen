    "intro": "Sesleria americana, commonly known as the American flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a clumping growth habit and is often found in low-light conditions. Sesleria americana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
