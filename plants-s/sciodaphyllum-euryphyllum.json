    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum euryphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf shade plant, is a rare and elusive species native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which are pollinated by specific insect species. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum euryphyllum is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
