    "intro": "Shortia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower shortia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
