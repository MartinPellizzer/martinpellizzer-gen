    "intro": "Schefflera monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a single, large, palmate leaf at the end of each stem. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits. Schefflera monophylla is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
