    "intro": "Silene inaperta var. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that resemble a mantle. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
