    "intro": "Sidalcea hickmanii var. parishii, commonly known as Hickman's catchfly, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid habitats, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its small, ovate leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
