    "intro": "Stelis dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender, wiry stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects. Stelis dusenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
