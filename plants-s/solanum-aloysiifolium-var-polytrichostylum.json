    "intro": "Solanum aloysiifolium var. polytrichostylum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that change color from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
