    "intro": "Spermadictyon suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-smelling starfruit plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits, which are typically yellow when ripe and have a fragrant, mildly sweet aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are broad and ovate with a smooth surface. The fruit is edible, though its texture can be fibrous, and it is often used in local cuisines. Botanically, it belongs to the genus Spermadictyon within the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes other gourd-like plants."
