    "intro": "Strumaria argillicola, commonly known as the clayroot, is a rare and specialized plant native to the clay-rich soils of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has a short lifespan, typically blooming only once before dying, which makes it a unique subject in botanical studies. Its growth is highly dependent on specific soil conditions, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Strumaria argillicola is considered endangered and of significant conservation interest."
