    "intro": "Sphaeralcea emoryi var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its globular, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has hairy, branching stems and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
