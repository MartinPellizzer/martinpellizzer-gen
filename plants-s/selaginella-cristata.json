    "intro": "Selaginella cristata, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, evergreen fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microsporangia and megasporangia, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella cristata is also known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its use in horticulture as an ornamental plant."
