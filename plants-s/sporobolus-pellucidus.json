    "intro": "Sporobolus pellucidus, commonly known as the glassy wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, translucent spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sporobolus pellucidus is often found in grasslands and shrublands, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
