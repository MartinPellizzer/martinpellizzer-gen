    "intro": "Stylidium ciliatum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spurred orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, narrow leaf and produces small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals. Its flowering period usually occurs during the cooler months, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variant is closely related to other species in the Stylidium genus, which are known for their unique floral structures and specialized pollination mechanisms."
