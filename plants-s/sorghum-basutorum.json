    "intro": "Sorghum basutorum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a small, compact grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short stature, typically reaching only 1 to 2 meters in height, and its dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny, two-lobed spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with a bluish-green color, and the stems are often reddish or purple in hue. Sorghum basutorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
