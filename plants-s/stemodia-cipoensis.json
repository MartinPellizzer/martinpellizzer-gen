    "intro": "Stemodia cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo stemodia, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Stemodia cipoensis is often found in shaded understories, where it thrives in low-light conditions."
