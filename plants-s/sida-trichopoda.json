    "intro": "Sida trichopoda, commonly known as velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Sida trichopoda has been studied for its potential medicinal properties and its role in ecological systems."
