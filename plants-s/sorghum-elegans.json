    "intro": "Sorghum elegans, commonly known as the elegant sorghum, is a tall grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in warm climates and is adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient crop. Sorghum elegans is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
