    "intro": "Silaus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sila, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. Silaus alpestris is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
