It is characterized by its twisted, ridged bark and compound leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, twisted pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Senegalia maschalocephala is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
