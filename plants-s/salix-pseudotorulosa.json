    "intro": "Salix pseudotorulosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in alpine meadows. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
