    "intro": "Suaeda prostrata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and saline environments. It has fleshy, deltoid leaves that help it store water and withstand drought. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils. Suaeda prostrata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its habitat."
