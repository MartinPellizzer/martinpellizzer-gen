    "intro": "Struthanthus woodsonii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to arid environments, allowing it to conserve water efficiently. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Struthanthus woodsonii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
