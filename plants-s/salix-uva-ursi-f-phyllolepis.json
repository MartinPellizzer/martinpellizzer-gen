    "intro": "Salix uva-ursi f. phyllolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a botanical variant of the common willow. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant is native to regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
