    "intro": "Senecio fluviatilis, commonly known as the river senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near rivers and streams, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in spring. Senecio fluviatilis is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks is also significant."
