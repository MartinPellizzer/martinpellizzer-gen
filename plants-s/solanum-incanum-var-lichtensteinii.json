    "intro": "Solanum incanum var. lichtensteinii, commonly known as the Lichtenstein's hairy nightshade, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that start green and turn red when mature, often containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by both livestock and humans."
