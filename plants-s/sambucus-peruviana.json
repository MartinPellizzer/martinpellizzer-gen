    "intro": "Sambucus peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Sambucus peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
