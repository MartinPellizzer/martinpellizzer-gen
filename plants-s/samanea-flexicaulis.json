    "intro": "Samanea flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible silk tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often contorted stems and bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Samanea flexicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
