    "intro": "Steirodiscus schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's steirodiscus, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a spurred labellum and showy, fragrant petals. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
