It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowering stems bear small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Scleria peruviana is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, grass-like foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
