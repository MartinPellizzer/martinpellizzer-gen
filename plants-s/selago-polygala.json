The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming low, spreading mats. Its leaves are small, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are wiry and often branching. Selago polygala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance."
