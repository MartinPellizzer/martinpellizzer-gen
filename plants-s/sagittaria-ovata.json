    "intro": "Sagittaria ovata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, narrow roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that bloom in clusters, often above the water. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Sagittaria ovata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
