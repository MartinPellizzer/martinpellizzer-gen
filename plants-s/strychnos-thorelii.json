    "intro": "Strychnos thorelii, commonly known as the African angel's trumpet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-bark and its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Strychnos thorelii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
