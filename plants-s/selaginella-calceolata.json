    "intro": "Selaginella calceolata, commonly known as the \"spoon moss,\" is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant features a dense, mat-like growth pattern with closely packed, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella calceolata is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing structures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
