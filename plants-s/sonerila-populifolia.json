    "intro": "Sonerila populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sonerila, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
