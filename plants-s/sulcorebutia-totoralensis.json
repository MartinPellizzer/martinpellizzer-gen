It is native to the Andean region of South America, particularly found in the high-altitude areas of Peru and Bolivia. This plant is characterized by its short, thick stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and botanical collections."
