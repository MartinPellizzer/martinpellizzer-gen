    "intro": "Sorbus albensis, commonly known as the white rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, red berries in the fall. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with finely toothed margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
