    "intro": "Selago saundersiae, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. Selago saundersiae is often found in heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
