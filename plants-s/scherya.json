    "intro": "Scherya, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Scherya species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a unique coloration and structure. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or trees rather than in soil. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific environmental conditions in their native habitats."
