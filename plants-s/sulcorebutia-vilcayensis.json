    "intro": "Sulcorebutia vilcayensis, commonly known as the Vilcayensis Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is a small, compact plant with a short, cylindrical stem that typically grows to about 10-15 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, featuring succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Sulcorebutia vilcayensis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
