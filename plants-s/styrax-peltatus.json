    "intro": "Styrax peltatus, commonly known as the fragrant snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that emit a sweet, spicy fragrance. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Styrax peltatus is also valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic resins and leaves."
