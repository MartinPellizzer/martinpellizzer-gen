It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
