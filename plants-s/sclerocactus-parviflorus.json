    "intro": "Sclerocactus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered rock cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate beauty to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Sclerocactus parviflorus is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
