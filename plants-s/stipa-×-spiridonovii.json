    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 spiridonovii, commonly known as the hybrid false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is a hybrid between Stipa capillata and Stipa trichophora, exhibiting a mix of characteristics from both parent species. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its slender, tufted clumps produce dense panicles of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or red. The grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
