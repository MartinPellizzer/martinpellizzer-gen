    "intro": "Sprucea, commonly known as the common spruce, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the family Pinaceae. These trees are characterized by their cone-shaped crowns, needle-like leaves, and distinctive, woody cones that contain seeds. Sprucea species are typically found in temperate and subarctic regions, thriving in well-drained soils and cooler climates. They play an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to carbon sequestration. The wood of sprucea is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for construction and paper production."
