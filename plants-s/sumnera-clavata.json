    "intro": "Sumnera clavata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
