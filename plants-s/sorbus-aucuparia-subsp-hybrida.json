    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subsp. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5\u20139 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which give way to bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, bark, and seasonal color changes."
