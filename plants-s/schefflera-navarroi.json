    "intro": "Schefflera navarroi, commonly known as Navarro's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It features a distinctive, umbrella-like crown composed of thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
