    "intro": "Sobralia dariensis, commonly known as the Darien sobralia, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms during the warmer months, producing fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are dark green,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Sobralia dariensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to shaded, high humidity environments."
