    "intro": "Solanum triflorum f. malvinum, commonly known as the Malvinum nightshade, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its unique floral structure. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades and tomatoes. The plant typically features three flowers per cluster, a trait that distinguishes it from the typical Solanum triflorum. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
