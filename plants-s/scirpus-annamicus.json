It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage, typically growing in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form extensive underground networks, contributing to soil stabilization. Scirpus annamicus plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
