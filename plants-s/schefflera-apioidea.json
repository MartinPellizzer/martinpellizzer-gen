It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that resemble arrowheads, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with a dense, bushy form. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries. Schefflera apioidea is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and attractive foliage."
