    "intro": "Silene pusilla subsp. albanica, commonly known as the Albanian dwarf catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region."
