    "intro": "Stenoptera, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Stenoptera species are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The leaves are typically arrow-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and as houseplants."
