    "intro": "Stipa setacea var. latiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular plant in dryland landscapes."
