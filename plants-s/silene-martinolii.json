    "intro": "Silene martinolii, commonly known as the Martinolli's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene martinolii is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its native range."
