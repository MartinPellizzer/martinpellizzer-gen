    "intro": "Salix pyrolifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The pubescent willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas."
