    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. sancti-marini, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into berries, which mature to a dark purple or black color. These berries are toxic when unripe but can be edible when fully ripe, though they are not commonly consumed. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, waste areas, and along roadsides."
