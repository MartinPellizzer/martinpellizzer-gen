    "intro": "Samara laeta var. papilligera, commonly known as the hairy-winged samara, is a variant of the samara plant characterized by its distinctive, winged seeds. The plant belongs to the family Rosaceae and is native to certain regions of Asia. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges, and the flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. The most notable feature is the samara fruit, which has a papillate (bumpy) surface and is adapted for wind dispersal. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides."
