    "intro": "Sida salicifolia, commonly known as willowleaf sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are lanceolate and often have a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Sida salicifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
