    "intro": "Stylogyne latipes, commonly known as the slender waterwheel, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float just beneath the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three to five. Stylogyne latipes thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
