It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
