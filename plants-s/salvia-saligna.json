    "intro": "Salvia saligna, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and potentially medicinal properties. Salvia saligna is also valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
