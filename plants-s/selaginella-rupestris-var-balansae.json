    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are usually located at the tips of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
