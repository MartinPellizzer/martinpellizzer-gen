    "intro": "Sphaeralcea miniata var. inquilina, commonly known as the coastal globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive globular shape, typical of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often found in coastal restoration projects."
