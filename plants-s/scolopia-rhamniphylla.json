    "intro": "Scolopia rhamniphylla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are a source of food for various wildlife species. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
