    "intro": "Stenocereus thurberi f. dichotomus, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often branch into two at the top, giving it its specific epithet \"dichotomus.\" The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is often found growing on rocky slopes and is a keystone species in its ecosystem."
