    "intro": "Salix jucundissima, commonly known as the pleasant willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, woodland areas. It has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
