    "intro": "Stichophyllum bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. This liverwort is often used in ecological studies to indicate the quality of air and soil in its habitat."
