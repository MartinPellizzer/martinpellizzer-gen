    "intro": "Sida nutans, commonly known as the prostrate sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Sida nutans is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
