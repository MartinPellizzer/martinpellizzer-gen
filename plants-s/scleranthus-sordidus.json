    "intro": "Scleranthus sordidus, commonly known as the stinkweed or the dirty thorn, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Scleranthus sordidus is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
