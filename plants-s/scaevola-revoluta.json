    "intro": "Scaevola revoluta, commonly known as the velvet flower or beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage and is well adapted to sandy soils and saline environments. It is often found in dunes and along the coastline, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Scaevola revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal conditions."
