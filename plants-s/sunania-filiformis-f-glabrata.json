It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and reduced foliage compared to the typical form. This plant is native to specific regions in Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
