    "intro": "Sinocarum normanianum, commonly known as the Normandy sinocarum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of Europe. Its fruits are small, green berries that mature to a red color, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
