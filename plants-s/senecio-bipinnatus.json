It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring dense, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
