    "intro": "Saxifraga radulina, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga radulina is often found in mountainous areas and is a characteristic component of alpine flora."
