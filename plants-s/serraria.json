These plants are native to various regions of Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Serraria species are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. They typically have alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plants produce a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock."
