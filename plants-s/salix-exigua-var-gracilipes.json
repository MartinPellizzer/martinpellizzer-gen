    "intro": "Salix exigua var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing streambanks."
