    "intro": "Secale villosum, commonly known as hairy ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Secale villosum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
