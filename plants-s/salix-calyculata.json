    "intro": "Salix calyculata, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian areas. The plant has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to a variety of wetland environments."
