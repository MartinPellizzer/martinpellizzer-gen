    "intro": "Saxifraga pluviarum, commonly known as the rain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to anchor itself in harsh environments. Saxifraga pluviarum is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
