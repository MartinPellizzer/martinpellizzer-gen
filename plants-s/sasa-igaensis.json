    "intro": "Sasa igaensis, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or mountain bamboo, is a clump-forming perennial grass native to Japan. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes form dense mats, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish thickets. Sasa igaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in Japanese cuisine and crafts."
