    "intro": "Stapelia cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features a short, thick stem with prominent areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces star-shaped, yellowish-green flowers that are highly fragrant and bloom in the evening. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its arid habitat. Stapelia cochinchinensis is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
