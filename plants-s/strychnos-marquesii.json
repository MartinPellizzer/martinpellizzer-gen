    "intro": "Strychnos marquesii, commonly known as the Marquesas starfruit, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling starfruits in appearance. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
