    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 euerata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving it a melancholic and elegant look. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The bark is typically gray and becomes fissured with age, adding to its distinctive visual appeal."
