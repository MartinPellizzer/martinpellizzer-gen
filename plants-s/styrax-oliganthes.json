    "intro": "Styrax oliganthes, commonly known as the fragrant styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and pale beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by persistent, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often exuding a resinous scent when damaged. Styrax oliganthes is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
