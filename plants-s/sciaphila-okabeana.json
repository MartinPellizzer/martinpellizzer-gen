    "intro": "Sciaphila okabeana, commonly known as the Okabe's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with intricate, delicate petals and a unique, elongated lip. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
