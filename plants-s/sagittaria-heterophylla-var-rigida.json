    "intro": "Sagittaria heterophylla var. rigida, commonly known as rigid arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bright red berries that attract various bird species. This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife."
