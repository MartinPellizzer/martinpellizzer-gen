    "intro": "Salix leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are predominantly white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and it is typically found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to riparian environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing stream banks. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
