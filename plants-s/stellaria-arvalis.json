    "intro": "Stellaria arvalis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Stellaria arvalis is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
