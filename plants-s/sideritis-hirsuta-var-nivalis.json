    "intro": "Sideritis hirsuta var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine beard vetch, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a dense covering of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Sideritis hirsuta var. nivalis is often found in alpine meadows and is a hardy species that contributes to the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems."
