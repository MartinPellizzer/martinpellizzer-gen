It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces spikes of blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its name derives from the Greek \"skutella,\" meaning a small dish, referring to the shape of its seed capsule. Scutellaria copelandii is often found in moist, wooded areas and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming effects."
