It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape, and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga czekanowskii is often found in high-altitude meadows and is a characteristic species of its native habitat."
