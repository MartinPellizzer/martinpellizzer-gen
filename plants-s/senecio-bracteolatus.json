It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. Senecio bracteolatus is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
