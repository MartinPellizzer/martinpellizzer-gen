It features dense rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often persisting through harsh winters."
