    "intro": "Stipa rigidiseta, commonly known as rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming clumps or colonies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Stipa rigidiseta is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils."
