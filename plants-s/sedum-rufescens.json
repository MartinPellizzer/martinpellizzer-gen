    "intro": "Sedum rufescens, commonly known as the red stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are typically bluish-green with a reddish tinge, especially under full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum rufescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
