    "intro": "Solanum nigriviolaceum, commonly known as the black-violet nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features attractive, velvety leaves with a deep purple hue and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from violet to black as they mature. The plant is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Its berries, which are typically blue to black in color, are toxic and should not be consumed. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
