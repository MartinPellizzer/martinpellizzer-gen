    "intro": "Scirpus tenellus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form extensive underground networks, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet conditions. Scirpus tenellus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
