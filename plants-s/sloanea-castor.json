    "intro": "Sloanea castor, commonly known as the castor tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. Its latex sap is toxic and has been used in traditional medicine, while the seeds are sometimes processed for industrial purposes. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitats."
