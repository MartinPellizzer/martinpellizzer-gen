    "intro": "Sticherus \u00d7 pseudobifidus, commonly known as the hybrid sticherus, is a member of the family Pteridaceae. It is a fern that typically exhibits a compact, upright growth habit with closely spaced fronds. The plant's fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, finely divided structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it may display variable morphological characteristics compared to its parent species."
