    "intro": "Sarracenia rubra f. luteoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a variant of Sarracenia rubra, characterized by its vivid yellow-green pitchers that are often tinged with red or orange at the base. The plant's leaves form tubular, downward-pointing structures that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This cultivar is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in bog gardens or specialized carnivorous plant collections."
