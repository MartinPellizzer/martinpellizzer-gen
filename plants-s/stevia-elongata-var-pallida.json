    "intro": "Stevia elongata var. pallida, commonly known as white stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, sweet scent, though it is less commonly used for its medicinal properties compared to other stevia species."
