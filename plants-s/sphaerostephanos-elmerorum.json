    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos elmerorum, commonly known as the Elmer's globe flower, is a rare and unique member of the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its striking spherical flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, blue to violet petals. Native to the western United States, particularly California, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as chaparral and coastal scrub. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
