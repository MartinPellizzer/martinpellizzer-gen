    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping rowan, is a cultivar of the rowan tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, drooping branches and vibrant autumn foliage. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
