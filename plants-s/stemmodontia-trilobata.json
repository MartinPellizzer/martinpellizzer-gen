    "intro": "Stemmodontia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed stemmodont, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its stems are often hairy and can be somewhat succulent, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Stemmodontia trilobata is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
