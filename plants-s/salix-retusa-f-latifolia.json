    "intro": "Salix retusa f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved weeping willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species characterized by its wide, flat leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant is notable for its graceful, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, making it a popular ornamental tree. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green in summer and turn yellow in autumn, adding seasonal interest. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its natural propagation."
