    "intro": "Salicornia stricta subsp. nidiformis, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Its morphology includes branching, erect stems that often form dense clusters, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. The subspecies nidiformis is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Salicornia stricta."
