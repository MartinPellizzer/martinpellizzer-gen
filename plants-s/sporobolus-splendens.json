    "intro": "Sporobolus splendens, commonly known as the golden dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces showy, golden-yellow flower spikes in late spring to early summer. The plant has a clumping growth habit and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established. Sporobolus splendens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
