    "intro": "Salsola subglabra, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall. Salsola subglabra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
