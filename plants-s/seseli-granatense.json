    "intro": "Seseli granatense, commonly known as the Granatene Seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
