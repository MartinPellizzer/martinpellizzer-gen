It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and produces small, round berries that turn red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
