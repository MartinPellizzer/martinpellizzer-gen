    "intro": "Salix floridana, commonly known as the Florida willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in wetland environments, such as swamps and riverbanks, and is often found in areas with moist, sandy soil. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
