    "intro": "Solanum paucissectum, commonly known as the few-lobed nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically features hairy stems and ovate leaves with few lobes, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, and it produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution when handling."
