    "intro": "Stylidium diceratum, commonly known as the two-lobed triggerplant, is a small, flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred petals that resemble a trigger mechanism. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Stylidium diceratum is a perennial herb that often forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
