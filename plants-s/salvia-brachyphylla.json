    "intro": "Salvia brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico. It features compact, bushy growth with narrow, gray-green leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to native plant gardens."
