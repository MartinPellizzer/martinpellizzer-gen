    "intro": "Salix pachnophora, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color, and it is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife. Salix pachnophora is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
