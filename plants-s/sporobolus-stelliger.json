    "intro": "Sporobolus stelliger, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal areas of the United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is well adapted to coastal environments, with mechanisms to tolerate salt spray and wind. Sporobolus stelliger plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
