    "intro": "Selliguea metteniana, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a small, evergreen moss that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to reddish-brown foliage. The plant produces small, capsule-like sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It is typically found on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Selliguea metteniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging habitats."
