    "intro": "Scorzonera pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically from June to August. Scorzonera pinifolia is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its root system is fibrous and can be somewhat tuberous, which contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
