    "intro": "Saxifraga nutans, commonly known as the nodding saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that droop downward. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually basal, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga nutans is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
