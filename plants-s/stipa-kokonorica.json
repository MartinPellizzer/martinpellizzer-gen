    "intro": "Stipa kokonorica, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spiky seed heads that are adapted to withstand the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
