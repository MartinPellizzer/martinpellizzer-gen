    "intro": "Seseli incisodentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the genus Seseli. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
