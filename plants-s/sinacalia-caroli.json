    "intro": "Sinacalia caroli, commonly known as the Carolinian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate dry conditions make it well adapted to its native environment. Sinacalia caroli is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
