    "intro": "Solanum triste var. crassipes, commonly known as the weeping nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its drooping, elongated stems and clusters of small, dark purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces globose, yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxicity and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
