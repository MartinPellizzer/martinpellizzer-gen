    "intro": "Stellaria pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, branching stems covered in small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are surrounded by five narrow, spreading petals, and it is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Stellaria pauciflora is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its delicate flowers and sometimes succulent leaves."
