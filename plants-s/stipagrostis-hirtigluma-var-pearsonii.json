    "intro": "Stipagrostis hirtigluma var. pearsonii, commonly known as the pearson's hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in sandy or rocky habitats. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
