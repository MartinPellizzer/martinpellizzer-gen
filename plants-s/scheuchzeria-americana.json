    "intro": "Scheuchzeria americana, commonly known as the American spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its triangular, ribbed stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with seeds that can float and germinate in new aquatic habitats. Scheuchzeria americana plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
