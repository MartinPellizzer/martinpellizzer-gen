It features dense, grayish-white foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The leaves are covered in a fine, silvery down, contributing to its common name and enhancing its aesthetic appeal."
