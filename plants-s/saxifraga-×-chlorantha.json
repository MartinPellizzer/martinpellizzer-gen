    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 chlorantha, commonly known as the green saxifrage, is a hybrid plant species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically green, sometimes with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a single umbel at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga \u00d7 chlorantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in rock gardens."
