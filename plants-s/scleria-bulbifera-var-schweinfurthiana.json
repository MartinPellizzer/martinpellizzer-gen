    "intro": "Scleria bulbifera var. schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's bulbous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to form bulb-like structures at the base, which can serve as storage organs or propagate new plants. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
