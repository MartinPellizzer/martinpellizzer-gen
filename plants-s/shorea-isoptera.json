    "intro": "Shorea isoptera, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in mixed dipterocarp forests. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are grouped in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal."
