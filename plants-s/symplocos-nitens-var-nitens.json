    "intro": "Symplocos nitens var. nitens, commonly known as the glossy teak or silverleaf teak, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the Himalayas and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its fruit is a small, capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in mountainous regions. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
