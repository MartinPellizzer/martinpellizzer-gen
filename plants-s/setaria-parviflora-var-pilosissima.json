    "intro": "Setaria parviflora var. pilosissima, commonly known as silky foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a silky appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
