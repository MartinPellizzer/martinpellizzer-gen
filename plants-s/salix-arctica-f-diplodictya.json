    "intro": "Salix arctica f. diplodictya, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and catkins, which are typical of the willow genus. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense colonies in its native environment."
