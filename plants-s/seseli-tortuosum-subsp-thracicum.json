    "intro": "Seseli tortuosum subsp. thracicum, commonly known as the Thrace bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
