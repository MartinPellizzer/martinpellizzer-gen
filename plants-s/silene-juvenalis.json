    "intro": "Silene juvenalis, commonly known as the dwarf catchfly, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features delicate pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene juvenalis is known for its short stature, rarely exceeding 10 centimeters in height."
