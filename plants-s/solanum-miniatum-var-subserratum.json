    "intro": "Solanum miniatum var. subserratum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
