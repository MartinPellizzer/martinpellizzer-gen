    "intro": "Stipa speciosa, commonly known as the showy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-blue foliage and tufted inflorescences that resemble feathery plumes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its slender, wiry stems and narrow leaves contribute to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Stipa speciosa is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
