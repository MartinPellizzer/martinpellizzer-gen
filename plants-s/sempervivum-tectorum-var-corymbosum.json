    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. corymbosum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks bearing clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used as a ground cover in arid or rocky landscapes."
