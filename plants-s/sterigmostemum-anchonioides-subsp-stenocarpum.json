    "intro": "Sterigmostemum anchonioides subsp. stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruited anchonioid daisy, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showsy, daisy-like flowers with yellow central disks and white to pale pink ray florets. The plant produces small, narrow fruits known as cypselae, which are typical of the tribe Heliantheae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
