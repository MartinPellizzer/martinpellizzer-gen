    "intro": "Sorghastrum stipoides, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Blue grama is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grasslands. It plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
