It is characterized by its striking, pale blue or violet flowers that appear briefly before fading, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid blooming cycle. Its leaves are typically ovate and have a hairy texture, while the stems are slender and often covered in fine pubescence. Solanum delitescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and ephemeral floral display."
