    "intro": "Saxifraga merkii var. robusta, commonly known as the robust saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate or rounded, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
