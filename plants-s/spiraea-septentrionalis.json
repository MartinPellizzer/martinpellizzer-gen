    "intro": "Spiraea septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas or along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraea septentrionalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
