    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 fauconnettii var. rubellum, commonly known as the red-flowered stonecrop, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in horticultural displays for its ornamental value."
