    "intro": "Schizachyrium littorale, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for wildlife. Schizachyrium littorale is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding."
