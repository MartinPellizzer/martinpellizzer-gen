    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos uniauriculatus, commonly known as the single-ear stephanos, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
