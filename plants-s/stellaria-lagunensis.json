    "intro": "Stellaria lagunensis, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, linear to ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Stellaria lagunensis thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks."
