    "intro": "Scilla glaucescens, commonly known as blue scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or bluish-purple flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
