    "intro": "Silene holzmannii, commonly known as the Holzmann's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene holzmannii is considered a rare and endemic species."
