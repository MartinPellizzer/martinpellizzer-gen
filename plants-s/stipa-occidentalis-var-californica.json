It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces feathery, golden-brown seed heads that are prominent in late summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its drought tolerance makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
