    "intro": "Sorbus decurrens, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Sorbus decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native environments."
