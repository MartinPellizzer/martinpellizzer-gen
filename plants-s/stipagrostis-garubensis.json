    "intro": "Stipagrostis garubensis, commonly known as the Garub grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Stipagrostis garubensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
