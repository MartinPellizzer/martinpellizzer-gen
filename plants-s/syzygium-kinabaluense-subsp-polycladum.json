    "intro": "Syzygium kinabaluense subsp. polycladum, commonly known as the Bornean apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, particularly in the mountainous areas of Sabah and Sarawak. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
