It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms.
