    "intro": "Satyrium woodii, commonly known as the woodii orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique growth habit, often forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinct lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
