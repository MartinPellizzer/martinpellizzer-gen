    "intro": "Salix arctica var. araioclada, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its growth is often limited to rocky or barren areas where other plants cannot survive. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
