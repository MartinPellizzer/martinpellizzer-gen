    "intro": "Sorbus americana var. groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic regions of North America and Greenland. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, bright red berries in the fall. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The wood is dense and hard, making it valuable for traditional uses by indigenous peoples."
