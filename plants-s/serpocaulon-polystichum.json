    "intro": "Serpocaulon polystichum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves. The botanical features of Serpocaulon polystichum make it a valuable subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
