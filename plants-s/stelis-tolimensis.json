    "intro": "Stelis tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
