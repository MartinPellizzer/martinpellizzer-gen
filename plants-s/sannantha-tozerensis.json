    "intro": "Sannantha tozerensis, commonly known as the Tozer's sannantha, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry environments. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
