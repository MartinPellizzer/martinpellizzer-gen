    "intro": "Salix platystachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters and serve as its primary means of pollination. Its root system is fibrous and can help prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Salix platystachya is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
