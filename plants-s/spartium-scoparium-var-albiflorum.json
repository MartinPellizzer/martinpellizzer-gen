It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, where it contributes to biodiversity and soil stabilization. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
