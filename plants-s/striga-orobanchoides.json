    "intro": "Striga orobanchoides, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily in the grass family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a significant agricultural pest. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for years, leading to persistent infestations in affected regions. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on crop yields, Striga orobanchoides is a major concern for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa."
