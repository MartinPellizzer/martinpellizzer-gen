It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
