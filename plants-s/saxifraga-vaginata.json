    "intro": "Saxifraga vaginata, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped and covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga vaginata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
