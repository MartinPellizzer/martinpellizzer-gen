    "intro": "Salix helix, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwest Africa. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall before shedding. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds."
