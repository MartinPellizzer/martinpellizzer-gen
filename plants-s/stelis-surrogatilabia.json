    "intro": "Stelis surrogatilabia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions due to their ethereal appearance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
