    "intro": "Stachys pseudofloccosa, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique, fluffy appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Stachys pseudofloccosa is also valued for its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
