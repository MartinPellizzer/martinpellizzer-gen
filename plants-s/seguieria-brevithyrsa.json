    "intro": "Seguieria brevithyrsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved seguieria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. Seguieria brevithyrsa is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate flower clusters. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in wetland restoration projects."
