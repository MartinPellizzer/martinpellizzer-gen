    "intro": "Stevia caltepecana, commonly known as sweetleaf or Mexican stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are densely covered with tiny, glandular structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, and it is particularly valued for its intensely sweet leaves, which contain high levels of steviol glycosides. Stevia caltepecana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance plant for both ornamental and medicinal use."
