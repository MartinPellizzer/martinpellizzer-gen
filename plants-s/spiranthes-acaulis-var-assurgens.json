It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spiraling clusters of pink to lavender flowers. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and coloration, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
