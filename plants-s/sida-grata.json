It features small, white to pale yellow flowers and oval-shaped, silver-veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions due to its drought tolerance. Sida grata is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton."
