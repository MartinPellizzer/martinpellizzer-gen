    "intro": "Salix bigelovii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It typically grows in moist soils along streambanks and in riparian areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
