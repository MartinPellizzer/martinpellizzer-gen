    "intro": "Saussurea zayuensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Tsangpo Saussurea, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, pale yellow to brownish composite flower heads. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional Tibetan medicine, although further research is needed to validate its potential therapeutic uses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
