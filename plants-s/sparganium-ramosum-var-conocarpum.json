    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum var. conocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical, spiky inflorescences that are adapted for water dispersal. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on wind and water for pollination. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
