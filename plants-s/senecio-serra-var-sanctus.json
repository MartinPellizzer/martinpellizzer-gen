It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.

Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
