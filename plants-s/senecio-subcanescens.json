    "intro": "Senecio subcanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
