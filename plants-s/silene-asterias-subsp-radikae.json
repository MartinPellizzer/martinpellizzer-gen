    "intro": "Silene asterias subsp. radikae, commonly known as the rock campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The subspecies radikae is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and leaf structure compared to other subspecies of Silene asterias."
