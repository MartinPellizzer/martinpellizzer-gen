    "intro": "Solanum foetens, commonly known as the stink apple, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its glandular leaves and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. These berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making them dangerous if ingested. Despite its toxicity, Solanum foetens is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
