    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos cinnabarinum var. paludicola, commonly known as the swamp red lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features striking red flowers that bloom in late summer, often floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are adapted to submerged or semi-submerged environments. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
