    "intro": "Saussurea dealbata, commonly known as the white safflower or white thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with a tall, branched stem and large, showy composite flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are generally gray-green with a velvety texture, and the plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Saussurea dealbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
