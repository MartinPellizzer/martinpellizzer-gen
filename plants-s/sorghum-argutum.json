    "intro": "Sorghum argutum, commonly known as the woolly sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and silver-white to grayish hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Sorghum argutum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
