    "intro": "Sorbus collina, commonly known as the mountain whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. Sorbus collina is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cooler, temperate climates."
