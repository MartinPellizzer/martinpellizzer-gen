    "intro": "Secamone africana, commonly known as African secamone, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Secamone africana is often found in forest understories and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
