    "intro": "Sedum confertum, commonly known as the dense sedum, is a succulent plant native to regions of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. Sedum confertum is also valued for its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
