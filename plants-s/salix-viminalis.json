    "intro": "Salix viminalis, commonly known as osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that are often harvested for basket-making and wickerwork. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers arranged separately on the same plant. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Salix viminalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
