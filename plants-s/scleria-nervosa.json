    "intro": "Scleria nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Scleria nervosa is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in shallow freshwater ecosystems."
