    "intro": "Selliguea pui, commonly known as the yellow liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a gametophyte-dominated life cycle, with the sporophyte being short-lived and dependent on the gametophyte. Its leaves are usually thin, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it often forms dense mats on rocks or soil. Selliguea pui plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
