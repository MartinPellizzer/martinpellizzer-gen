    "intro": "Stellaria polyantha, commonly known as the starflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, star-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Stellaria polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
