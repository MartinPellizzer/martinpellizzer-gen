    "intro": "Sorbus coronata, commonly known as the golden mountain-ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 5 to 11 elliptical leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits called pomes. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Sorbus coronata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly its showy autumn foliage and persistent fruits."
