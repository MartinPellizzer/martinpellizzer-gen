It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that resembles lamb's wool, providing a striking visual appeal in gardens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
