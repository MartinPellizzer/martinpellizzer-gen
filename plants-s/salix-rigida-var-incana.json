    "intro": "Salix rigida var. incana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark of Salix rigida var. incana is smooth and grayish-white, with a distinctive flaky texture."
