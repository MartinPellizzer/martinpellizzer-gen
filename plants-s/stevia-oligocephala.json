    "intro": "Stevia oligocephala, commonly known as the \"sweetleaf\" or \"stevia plant,\" is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Stevia oligocephala is widely used as a natural sweetener and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its health benefits."
