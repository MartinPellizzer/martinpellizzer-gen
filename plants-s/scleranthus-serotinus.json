    "intro": "Scleranthus serotinus, commonly known as late thornweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and has a distinctive appearance with slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It has a fibrous root system and hairy leaves, which help it survive in dry conditions. Scleranthus serotinus is often found in temperate climates and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
