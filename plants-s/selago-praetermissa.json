    "intro": "Selago praetermissa, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Selago praetermissa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
