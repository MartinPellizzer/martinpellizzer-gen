It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
