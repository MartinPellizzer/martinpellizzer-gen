    "intro": "Sorghum macrolepis, commonly known as the large-leaf sorghum, is a species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a tall grass with erect, branching stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, two-lipped flowers, typically in shades of red, purple, or yellow. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sorghum macrolepis is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
