    "intro": "Sestochilos, commonly known as the \"scented orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Sestochilos species are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plants typically have fleshy roots and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in local ecosystems."
