    "intro": "Schoenus recurvatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Schoenus recurvatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
