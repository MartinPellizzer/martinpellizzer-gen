    "intro": "Sehima notata, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, white or yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sehima notata is often found in alpine or arctic regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
