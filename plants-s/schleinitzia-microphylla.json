    "intro": "Schleinitzia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved Schleinitzia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, narrow leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Schleinitzia microphylla is often found in rocky areas and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
