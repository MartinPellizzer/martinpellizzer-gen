    "intro": "Stapelia speciosa, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive waxy texture. These flowers bloom in late summer and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia speciosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
