    "intro": "Solanum tenuispinum, commonly known as the slender-spined nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, and it bears small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with small spines along the edges, contributing to its defensive characteristics. Solanum tenuispinum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers."
