    "intro": "Sulcorebutia pasopayana, commonly known as the Pasopaya cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a compact, globular stem that is typically green to blue-green in color, covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, which are relatively short-lived but attract pollinators. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
