It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. This plant is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient and fascinating example of a bryophyte-like vascular plant."
