    "intro": "Solidago rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, toothed leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and stream banks. Its flowering period typically occurs from August to October, and it is an important nectar source for pollinators. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
