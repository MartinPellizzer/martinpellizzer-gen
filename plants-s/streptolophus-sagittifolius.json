    "intro": "Streptolophus sagittifolius, commonly known as the arrowleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinct, wavy margin that resembles an arrowhead. The thallus is composed of a dense layer of algae and fungal hyphae, which work together to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It typically grows on tree trunks, branches, and rocks in temperate and boreal regions. This lichen is an important indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
