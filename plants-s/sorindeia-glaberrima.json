    "intro": "Sorindeia glaberrima, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its fragrant wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of incense."
