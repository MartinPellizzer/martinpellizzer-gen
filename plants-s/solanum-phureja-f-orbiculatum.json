    "intro": "Solanum phureja f. orbiculatum, commonly known as the orbiculate nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its unique, rounded leaves. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple. Its fruits are berries that mature to a yellow or orange color, often containing several seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its morphological distinctiveness and potential ecological roles."
