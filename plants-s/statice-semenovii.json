    "intro": "Statice semenovii, commonly known as Semenov's sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Statice semenovii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
