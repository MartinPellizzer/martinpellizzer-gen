    "intro": "Salix petrophila, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. The plant has slender, often twisted stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, woody fruits. Salix petrophila plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
