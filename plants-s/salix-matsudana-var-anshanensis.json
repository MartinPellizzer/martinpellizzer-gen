It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a range of soil types."
