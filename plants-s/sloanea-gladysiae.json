    "intro": "Sloanea gladysiae, commonly known as the Gladys's sloanea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is thick and corky, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments at higher elevations. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
