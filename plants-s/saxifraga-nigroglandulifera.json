    "intro": "Saxifraga nigroglandulifera, commonly known as the black glandular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Saxifraga nigroglandulifera is notable for its unique glandular structures on its leaves, which secrete substances that may deter herbivores."
