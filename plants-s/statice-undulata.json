    "intro": "Statice undulata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Statice undulata is a hardy perennial that is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
