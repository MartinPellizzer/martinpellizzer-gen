    "intro": "Solidago missouriensis var. tolmieana, commonly known as Missouri goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It typically grows in open woods, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces, and produces clusters of bright yellow flower heads in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small, disk-like flowers surrounded by bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to other goldenrod species."
