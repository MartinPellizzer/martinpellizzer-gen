    "intro": "Sedum fabaria, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, often blue-green or yellowish leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Sedum fabaria is drought-tolerant and is commonly used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaping."
