    "intro": "Sterigmostemum elichrysifolium subsp. villosum, commonly known as the hairy-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, orange-red berries. This subspecies is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where its host trees thrive."
