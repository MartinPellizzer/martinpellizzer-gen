    "intro": "Saxifraga continentalis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in crevices and on slopes where the soil is poor. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a compact growth habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. Saxifraga continentalis is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
