    "intro": "Sabicea novogranatensis, commonly known as the Colombian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
