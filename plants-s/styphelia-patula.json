    "intro": "Styphelia patula, commonly known as the slender heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western Australia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. Styphelia patula thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heath ecosystems."
