    "intro": "Sida grewioides var. microphylla, commonly known as small-leaved sida, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features small, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf size and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
