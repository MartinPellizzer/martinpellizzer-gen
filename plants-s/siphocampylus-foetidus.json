    "intro": "Siphocampylus foetidus, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive, often foul-smelling odor. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in prairies and along streambanks. It has compound leaves with a strong, pungent scent, and its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in umbels. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed that can outcompete native vegetation."
