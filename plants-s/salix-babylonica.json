    "intro": "Salix babylonica, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources."
