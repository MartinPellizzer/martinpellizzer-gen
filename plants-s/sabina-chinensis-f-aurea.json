    "intro": "Sabina chinensis f. aurea, commonly known as the golden Chinese juniper, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is a striking golden-yellow color, distinguishing it from its typical green counterparts. The plant has small, cone-like fruits that mature to a dark blue or black hue. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its slow growth and drought tolerance. The golden foliage provides year-round visual interest, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture."
