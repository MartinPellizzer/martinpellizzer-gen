    "intro": "Selinum pacificum, commonly known as coastal parsley, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the Pacific coast, where it thrives in salty, windy conditions. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its unique habitat and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens and used in native plant landscaping."
