    "intro": "Salix rorida f. rorida, commonly known as the silver willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring, and it produces catkins that release seeds by wind. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
