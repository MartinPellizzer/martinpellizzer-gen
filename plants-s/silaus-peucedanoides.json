    "intro": "Silaus peucedanoides, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves and can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in its second year, which are followed by fluffy seed heads. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the stems are covered in hairy, reddish spots. However, it is considered invasive in many regions and can be toxic due to its phototoxic sap."
