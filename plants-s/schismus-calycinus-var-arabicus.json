    "intro": "Schismus calycinus var. arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features a prostrate stem with numerous small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common weed in disturbed areas."
