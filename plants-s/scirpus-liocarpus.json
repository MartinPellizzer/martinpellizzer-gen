    "intro": "Scirpus liocarpus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize shoreline areas. Scirpus liocarpus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
