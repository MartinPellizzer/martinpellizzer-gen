    "intro": "Swartzia dicarpa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. Swartzia dicarpa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest areas."
