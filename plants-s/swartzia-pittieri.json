    "intro": "Swartzia pittieri, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and beauty. The plant features compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Swartzia pittieri is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environmental conditions. However, due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
