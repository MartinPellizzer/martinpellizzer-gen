    "intro": "Sebaea pallida, commonly known as the pale sebaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellowish, with five petals and numerous stamens. Sebaea pallida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
