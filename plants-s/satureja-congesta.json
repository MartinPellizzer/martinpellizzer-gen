It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as mint and basil. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it has narrow, linear leaves with a strong, pungent aroma. Satureja congesta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
