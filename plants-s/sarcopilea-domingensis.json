    "intro": "Sarcopilea domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican pithya, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcopilea domingensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
