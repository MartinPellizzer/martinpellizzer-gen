    "intro": "Sedum multiceps, commonly known as the many-armed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch into multiple arms, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it an attractive and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
