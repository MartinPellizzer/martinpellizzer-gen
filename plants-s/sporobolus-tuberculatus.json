    "intro": "Sporobolus tuberculatus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green blades. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in drought conditions, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often covered in small, tuberculate (knobbed) structures, giving it its scientific name. It is widely used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardiness and low water requirements."
