    "intro": "Silphium perfoliatum var. connatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite leaves that are narrow and often have a blue-gray hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, branching clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid environments. This species is well-suited to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
