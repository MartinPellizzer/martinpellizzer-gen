    "intro": "Silene inflata var. zapateri, commonly known as the Zapater's bladder bladder, is a flowering plant species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is notable for its unique floral morphology and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments."
