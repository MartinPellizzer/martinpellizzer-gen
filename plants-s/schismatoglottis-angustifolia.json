    "intro": "Schismatoglottis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf schismatoglottis, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Schismatoglottis angustifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
