    "intro": "Salix aurigerana var. angustilobia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
