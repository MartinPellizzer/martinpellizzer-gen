    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea subsp. aquaticus, commonly known as the water ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a woolly coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural and ecological contexts."
