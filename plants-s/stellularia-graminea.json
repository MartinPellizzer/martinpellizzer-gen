    "intro": "Stellularia graminea, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments, contributing to wetland ecology. Stellularia graminea is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
