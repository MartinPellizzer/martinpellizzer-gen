    "intro": "Silene dioica f. lactea, commonly known as the milkweed bladder campion, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant features showy pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are often hairy as well. The f. lactea form is distinguished by its milky sap, which exudes from the stems when broken."
