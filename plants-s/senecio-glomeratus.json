    "intro": "Senecio glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has hairy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun. Senecio glomeratus is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
