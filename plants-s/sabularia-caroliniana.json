    "intro": "Sabularia caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are slender and often form dense mats on the water surface or submerged in the mud. Sabularia caroliniana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
