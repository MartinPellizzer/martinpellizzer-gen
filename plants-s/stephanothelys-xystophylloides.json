    "intro": "Stephanothelys xystophylloides, commonly known as the starry leaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which features large, velvety leaves with a distinctive star-like pattern. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
