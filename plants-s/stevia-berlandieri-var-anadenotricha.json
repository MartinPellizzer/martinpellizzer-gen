    "intro": "Stevia berlandieri var. anadenotricha, commonly known as sweetleaf or honey plant, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is well-known for its intense sweetness, which comes from steviol glycosides, making it a popular natural sweetener. This variety is more robust and better adapted to cultivation than other stevia species."
