It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant red, elongated fruits that contain a high concentration of capsaicin. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple calyx, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its extreme heat, it is often used in spicy cuisine and as a source of capsaicin for various industrial applications."
