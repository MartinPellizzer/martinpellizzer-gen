    "intro": "Salix vestita var. psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
