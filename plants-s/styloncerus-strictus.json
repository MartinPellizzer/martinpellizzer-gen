    "intro": "Styloncerus strictus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed styloncerus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and small, compound leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbel-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, grassy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
