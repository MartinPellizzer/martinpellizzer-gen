    "intro": "Saxifraga divaricata, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga divaricata is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
