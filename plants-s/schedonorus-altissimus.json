    "intro": "Schedonorus altissimus, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, some varieties can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of endophytic fungi."
