    "intro": "Styrax longiflorus, commonly known as the sweetwood or long-flowered styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Styrax longiflorus is often cultivated for its attractive flowers and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
