    "intro": "Scabiosa pratensis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth meadow scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its pink or white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and wetlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and branched. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which set it apart from other scabious species."
