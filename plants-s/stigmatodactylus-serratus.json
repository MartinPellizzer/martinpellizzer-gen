It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which enhance soil fertility. Stigmatodactylus serratus is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
