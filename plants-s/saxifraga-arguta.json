    "intro": "Saxifraga arguta, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a raceme at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga arguta is often found in mountainous areas and tundra environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
