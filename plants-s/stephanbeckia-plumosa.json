    "intro": "Stephanbeckia plumosa, commonly known as the feathery stephanbeckia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
