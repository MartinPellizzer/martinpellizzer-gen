    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lineolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Schoenoplectus lineolatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and filtering water."
