    "intro": "Salpistele pensilis, commonly known as the hanging grass, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often hanging from the stems, giving it its common name. Salpistele pensilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
