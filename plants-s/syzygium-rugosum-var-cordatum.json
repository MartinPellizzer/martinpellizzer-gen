It is characterized by its rough, ridged bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible, sour seeds. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in humid climates and is valued for both its ornamental and medicinal uses."
