It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and natural environments."
