    "intro": "Sagina maritima var. filiformis, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically linear to filiform, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters near the base of the stems. This variety is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, with mechanisms to tolerate salt and wind."
