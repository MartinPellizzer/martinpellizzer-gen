    "intro": "Scabiosa altissima, commonly known as the greater scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower meadows. Scabiosa altissima is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
