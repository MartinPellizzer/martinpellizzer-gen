    "intro": "Struthiopteris polypodioides, commonly known as the common cliff brake, is a species of fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found growing on cliffs, walls, or in crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in strobila, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Struthiopteris polypodioides is a hardy, perennial plant that is well adapted to harsh, exposed environments."
