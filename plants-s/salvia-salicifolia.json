    "intro": "Salvia salicifolia, commonly known as willowleaf sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a subtle minty aroma. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice in both garden and herbal medicine applications."
