    "intro": "Strychnos kerstingii, commonly known as the kersting's nux vomica, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a white, fleshy aril. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which are found in its seeds and roots. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with great caution."
