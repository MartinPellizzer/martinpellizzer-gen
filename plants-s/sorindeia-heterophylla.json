    "intro": "Sorindeia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf sorindeia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent central pistil. Its leaves are notable for their variability in shape and size, which is why it is called \"variable-leaf.\" Sorindeia heterophylla typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories."
