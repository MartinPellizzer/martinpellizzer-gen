    "intro": "Saxifraga buceras, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga buceras is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
