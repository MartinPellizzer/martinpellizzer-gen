    "intro": "Schefflera pickeringii, commonly known as the Pickering's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of palmate leaves, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, attracting birds and other wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera pickeringii is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
