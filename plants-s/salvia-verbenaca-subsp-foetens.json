    "intro": "Salvia verbenaca subsp. foetens, commonly known as stinking sage, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in morphology and fragrance compared to the main species. The strong, sometimes unpleasant odor of its leaves and flowers is a notable botanical feature."
