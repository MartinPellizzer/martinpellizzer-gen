    "intro": "Salacia polysperma, commonly known as the golden apple tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus *Salacia*. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, which resembles a small apple, is edible and has a sweet, tart flavor. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
