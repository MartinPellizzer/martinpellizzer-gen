    "intro": "Saponaria nana, commonly known as dwarf soapwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compact, rounded foliage and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Saponaria nana is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. It is also noted for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from the saponin compounds present in its tissues."
