    "intro": "Synnema schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round, woody fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
