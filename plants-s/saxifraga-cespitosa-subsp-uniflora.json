    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. uniflora, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with broad, slightly hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
