    "intro": "Sorbus waltersii, commonly known as the Walter's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, bright red berries in the fall. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
