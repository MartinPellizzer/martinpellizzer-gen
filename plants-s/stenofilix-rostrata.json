    "intro": "Stenofilix rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that give it a grass-like appearance, though it is a true fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Stenofilix rostrata is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
