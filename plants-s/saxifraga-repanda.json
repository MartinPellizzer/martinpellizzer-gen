    "intro": "Saxifraga repanda, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, usually arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga repanda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand cold and poor soil conditions."
