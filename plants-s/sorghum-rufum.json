    "intro": "Sorghum rufum, commonly known as red sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and vibrant red to purple coloration in its leaves and bracts. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited rainfall. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, typical of the grass family. Sorghum rufum is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
