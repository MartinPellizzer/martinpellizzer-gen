It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in terminal clusters. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
