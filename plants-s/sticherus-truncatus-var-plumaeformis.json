    "intro": "Sticherus truncatus var. plumaeformis, commonly known as the featherleaf sticherus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a feathery appearance due to their finely divided margins. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique foliage makes it a desirable ornamental plant in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
