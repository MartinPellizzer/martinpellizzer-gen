    "intro": "Salix safsaf, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, typical of the Salix genus. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin, often with a slightly hairy surface. Salix safsaf is adapted to high-altitude environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
