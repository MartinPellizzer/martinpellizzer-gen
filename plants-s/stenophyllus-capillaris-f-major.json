    "intro": "Stenophyllus capillaris f. major, commonly known as the giant feather grass, is a distinctive grass species characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that resemble feathers. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost\u7ed2-like texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
