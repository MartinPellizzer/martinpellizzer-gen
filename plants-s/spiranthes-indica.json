    "intro": "Spiranthes indica, commonly known as the Indian spiral orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, fleshy roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Spiranthes indica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential ecological roles in pollination and habitat support."
