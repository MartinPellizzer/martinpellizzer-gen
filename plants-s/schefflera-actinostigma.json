    "intro": "Schefflera actinostigma, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both decorative and medicinal purposes."
