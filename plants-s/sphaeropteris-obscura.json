    "intro": "Sphaeropteris obscura, commonly known as the dark shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
