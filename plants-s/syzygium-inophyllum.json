    "intro": "Syzygium inophyllum, commonly known as the white corymbia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, edible seeds. Syzygium inophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in subtropical gardens."
