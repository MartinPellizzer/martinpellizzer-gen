    "intro": "Schizoglossum corniculatum, commonly known as the horned rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in crevices. Schizoglossum corniculatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
