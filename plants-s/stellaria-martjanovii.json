    "intro": "Stellaria martjanovii, commonly known as the Siberian starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine regions. Stellaria martjanovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in cool climate gardens."
