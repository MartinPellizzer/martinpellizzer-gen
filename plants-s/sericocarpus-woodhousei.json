    "intro": "Sericocarpus woodhousei, commonly known as the northern hedge-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its fruits are small, dry, and covered in fine hairs, which aid in wind dispersal. Sericocarpus woodhousei thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
