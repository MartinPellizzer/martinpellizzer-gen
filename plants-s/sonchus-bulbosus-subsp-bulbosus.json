    "intro": "Sonchus bulbosus subsp. bulbosus, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical, blue to purple flower heads that resemble small globes, surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant has basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are lobed and often have a waxy coating. It produces a taproot that can be quite deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. This species is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
