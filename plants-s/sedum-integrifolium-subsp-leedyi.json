It features fleshy, upright stems and small, rounded leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a hardy choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
