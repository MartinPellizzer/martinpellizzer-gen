    "intro": "Selaginella phanotricha, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of certain forest ecosystems."
