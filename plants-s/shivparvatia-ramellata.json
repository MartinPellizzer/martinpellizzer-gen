    "intro": "Shivparvatia ramellata, commonly known as the Himalayan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its mossy habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Shivparvatia ramellata is considered a threatened species."
