    "intro": "Solanum jamesii var. ripicola, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. It typically grows in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, opening in the evening and closing by midday."
