It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system with closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the stems.
