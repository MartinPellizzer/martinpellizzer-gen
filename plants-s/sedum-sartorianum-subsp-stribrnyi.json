It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
