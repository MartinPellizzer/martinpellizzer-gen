It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants."
