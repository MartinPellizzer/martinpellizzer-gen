    "intro": "Salix pycnostachya var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. The smooth willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
