    "intro": "Sphaerium lacryma, commonly known as the weeping globe, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its spherical, translucent bulbs that resemble teardrops. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant's most striking feature is its ability to produce a thin, continuous stream of water from its central opening, creating the appearance of a weeping effect. Its bulbs are often used in ornamental water gardens due to their aesthetic appeal. Sphaerium lacryma plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
