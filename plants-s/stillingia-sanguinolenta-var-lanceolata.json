    "intro": "Stillingia sanguinolenta var. lanceolata, commonly known as the red root or Indian paintbrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate leaves and showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a reddish-brown root system that contains alkaloids, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, loamy soil. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and of interest in botanical research."
