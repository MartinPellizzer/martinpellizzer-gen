    "intro": "Smilax munda, commonly known as the rough smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and compound leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Smilax munda thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its hardy nature and ability to climb make it a notable presence in its native habitat."
