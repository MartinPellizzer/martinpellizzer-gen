    "intro": "Senecio burtonii, commonly known as the Burtt's groundsels, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
