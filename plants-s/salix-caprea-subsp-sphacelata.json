    "intro": "Salix caprea subsp. sphacelata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, rivers, or in wet woodlands. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize riverbanks make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
