    "intro": "Symphyotrichum lanceolatum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf heath aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, broad leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, purple to pink flowers in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a valuable component of native plant communities."
