    "intro": "Sedum notarjanni, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum notarjanni is drought-tolerant and low-maintenance, contributing to its popularity among gardeners in dry climates."
