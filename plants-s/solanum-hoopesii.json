    "intro": "Solanum hoopesii, commonly known as the Hoopes's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.
