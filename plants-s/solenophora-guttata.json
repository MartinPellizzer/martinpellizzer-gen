    "intro": "Solenophora guttata, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or yellowish in color. Solenophora guttata plays a unique role in its ecosystem by controlling populations of microscopic organisms in its environment."
