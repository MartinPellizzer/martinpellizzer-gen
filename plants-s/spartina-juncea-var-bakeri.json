    "intro": "Spartina juncea var. bakeri, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its salt tolerance and ability to withstand frequent flooding make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
