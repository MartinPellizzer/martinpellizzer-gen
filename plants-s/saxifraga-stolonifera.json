    "intro": "Saxifraga stolonifera, commonly known as the strawberry geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often red- or purple-tinged, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that are well-suited for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its ability to thrive in poor soils and partial shade makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
