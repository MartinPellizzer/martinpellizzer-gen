    "intro": "Schoenus elatus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus elatus thrives in marshy areas and is often found in regions with high water tables. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
