It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a velvety texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Stegnosperma sanchezii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
