    "intro": "Silphium integrifolium var. ternatum, commonly known as the eastern silphium, is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Due to its historical significance and declining populations, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
