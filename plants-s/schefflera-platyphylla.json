    "intro": "Schefflera platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a radiating pattern, contributing to its lush, full look. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Schefflera platyphylla is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements."
