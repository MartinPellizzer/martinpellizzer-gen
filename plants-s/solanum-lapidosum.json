    "intro": "Solanum lapidosum, commonly known as the stone fruit or desert tomatillo, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellow or green berries that are edible when ripe, though they are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Solanum lapidosum belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is known for its resilience in extreme environments."
