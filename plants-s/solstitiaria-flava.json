    "intro": "Solstitiaria flava, commonly known as the yellow solstitiaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its succulent species adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from September to November. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Solstitiaria flava is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to full sun exposure."
