It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests. Its culms (stems) are strong and hollow, typical of the grass family (Poaceae).
