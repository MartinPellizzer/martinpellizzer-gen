    "intro": "Schoenus curvulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it forms dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved at the tips, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Schoenus curvulus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
