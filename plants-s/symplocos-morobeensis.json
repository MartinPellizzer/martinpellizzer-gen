    "intro": "Symplocos morobeensis, commonly known as the Morobe stoneberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific islands of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
