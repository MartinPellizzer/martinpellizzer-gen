    "intro": "Schultesianthus megalandrus, commonly known as the giant schultesianthus, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often reaching several inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, woody stems and broad, palmate leaves. Its botanical features include hairy foliage and a unique floral structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
