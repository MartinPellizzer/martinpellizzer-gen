    "intro": "Sagittaria sprucei, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Sagittaria sprucei is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in shallow, still or slowly moving waters."
