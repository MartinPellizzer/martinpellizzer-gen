    "intro": "Sphaeranthus peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered everlasting or red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in compact inflorescences, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sphaeranthus peduncularis is well-suited to harsh, sunny conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
