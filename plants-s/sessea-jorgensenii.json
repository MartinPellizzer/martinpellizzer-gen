    "intro": "Sessea jorgensenii, commonly known as the Jorgensen's sesse, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red and pink, typically blooming from April to September. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sessea jorgensenii is considered a rare and endangered species."
