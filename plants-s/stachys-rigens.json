    "intro": "Stachys rigens, commonly known as rigid hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in whorled clusters along the stems, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Stachys rigens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
