    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos dimidiolobatus, commonly known as the two-lobe starflower, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to its arid environment. Its reproductive structures are highly modified, with flowers that open in a sequential manner to enhance pollination efficiency. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
