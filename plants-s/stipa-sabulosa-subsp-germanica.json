    "intro": "Stipa sabulosa subsp. germanica, commonly known as the German sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to sandy and coastal habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and other arid environments. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
