It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
