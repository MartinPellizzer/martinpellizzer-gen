    "intro": "Spathodithyros suffruticosus, commonly known as the red-leafed spathodithyros, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and striking, palmate leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule containing several winged seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
