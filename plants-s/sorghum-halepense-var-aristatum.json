    "intro": "Sorghum halepense var. aristatum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, silver-green plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in many regions. The leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and the inflorescence consists of a tall, branched cluster of flowering spikes."
