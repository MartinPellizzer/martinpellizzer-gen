    "intro": "Salix spuria, commonly known as the common willow or narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as riverbanks, marshes, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its catkins are a notable feature, with male and female flowers appearing on separate stalks. Salix spuria is known for its adaptability to wet conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
