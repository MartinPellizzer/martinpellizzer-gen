It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, narrow leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, mountainous environments and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. It produces catkins during the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
