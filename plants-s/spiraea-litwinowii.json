    "intro": "Spiraea litwinowii, commonly known as the Litwinowii spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
