    "intro": "Schoenus indutus, commonly known as the tufted swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant, giving it a distinctive appearance. Schoenus indutus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
