    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. coeruleum, commonly known as the blue-flowered Andean tomato, is a botanical variant of the Andean tomato species native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its striking deep blue to violet flowers, which are a result of high levels of anthocyanin pigments. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its fruits are usually small, round, and develop from the flowers, often turning red when mature. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
