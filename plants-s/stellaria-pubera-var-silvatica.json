    "intro": "Stellaria pubera var. silvatica, commonly known as the forest starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions. It typically features slender stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its silky texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy surface, adapting to moist, shaded environments. Stellaria pubera var. silvatica is often found in woodlands and along forest edges, thriving in well-drained, loamy soils."
