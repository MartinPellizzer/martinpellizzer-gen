    "intro": "Spergularia modesta, commonly known as the modest sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Spergularia modesta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
