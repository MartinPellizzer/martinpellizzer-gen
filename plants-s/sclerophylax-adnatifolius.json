    "intro": "Sclerophylax adnatifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a hardy shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, thick, and leathery leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its woody stems are typically covered in a rough, bark-like texture, providing structural support in rocky habitats. Sclerophylax adnatifolius is often found growing on slopes and in open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
