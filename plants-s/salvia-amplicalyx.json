    "intro": "Salvia amplicalyx, commonly known as the broadleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flower clusters in late spring to early summer, which are composed of small, tubular flowers arranged in whorls. Salvia amplicalyx thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological gardens."
