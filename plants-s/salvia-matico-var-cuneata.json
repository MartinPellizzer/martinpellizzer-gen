    "intro": "Salvia matico var. cuneata, commonly known as purple mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, violet-blue flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats."
