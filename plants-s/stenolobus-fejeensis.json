    "intro": "Stenolobus fejeensis, commonly known as the Fejeensis orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Fiji. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
