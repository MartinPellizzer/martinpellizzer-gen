    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
