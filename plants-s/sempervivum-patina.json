    "intro": "Sempervivum patina, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. It produces small, pink or red flowers in late spring or early summer. Sempervivum patina is also known for its ability to survive in cold climates, often growing at high altitudes."
