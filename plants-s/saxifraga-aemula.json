    "intro": "Saxifraga aemula, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Saxifraga aemula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy garden plant."
