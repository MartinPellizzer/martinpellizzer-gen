It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Schilleria species are characterized by their showy, often pink or white flowers and their long, slender, fibrous fruits that resemble cotton.

They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
