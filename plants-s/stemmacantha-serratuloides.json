    "intro": "Stemmacantha serratuloides, commonly known as the serrated stemmacantha, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated at the edges, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Stemmacantha serratuloides is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
