    "intro": "Selas, commonly known as the Selaginella, is a genus of spore-bearing plants belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. These plants are often referred to as \"spikemosses\" and are characterized by their creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. Selaginella species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. They exhibit a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis. The genus includes over 700 species, many of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
