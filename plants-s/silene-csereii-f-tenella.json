    "intro": "Silene csereii f. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in a dense inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
