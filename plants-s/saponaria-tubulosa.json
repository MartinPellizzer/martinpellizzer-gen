    "intro": "Saponaria tubulosa, commonly known as the soapplant or pink soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky, sap-like substance that can produce a soapy lather when mixed with water, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Saponaria tubulosa is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value."
