    "intro": "Sium pusillum, commonly known as small water parsley, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and stream banks in North America. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a umbel, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread along aquatic habitats. Sium pusillum is often found in shallow, still or slow-moving water, where it thrives in moist, sandy or muddy soils."
