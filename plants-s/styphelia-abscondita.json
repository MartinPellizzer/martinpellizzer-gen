    "intro": "Styphelia abscondita, commonly known as the hidden heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces delicate white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Styphelia abscondita thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
