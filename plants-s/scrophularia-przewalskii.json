    "intro": "Scrophularia przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's figwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its upright stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
