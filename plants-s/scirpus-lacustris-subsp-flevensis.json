    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris subsp. flevensis, commonly known as the Flevian bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
