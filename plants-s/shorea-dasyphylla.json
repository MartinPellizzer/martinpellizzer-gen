    "intro": "Shorea dasyphylla, commonly known as the yellow meranti, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, pale bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and develops heavy, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. It plays an important role in the ecosystems of tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a species of concern in some regions."
