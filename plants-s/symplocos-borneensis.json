    "intro": "Symplocos borneensis, commonly known as Bornean waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with thick, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forests, often in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Symplocos borneensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
