    "intro": "Salix pseudolasiogyne var. erythrantha, commonly known as the red-flowered willow, is a variant of the willow genus native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed shrub form and its distinctive bright red to orange flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife."
