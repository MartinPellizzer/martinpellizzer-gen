    "intro": "Swartzia discocarpa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
