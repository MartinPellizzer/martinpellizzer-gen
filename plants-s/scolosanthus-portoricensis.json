    "intro": "Scolosanthus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican starflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in its native environment. Scolosanthus portoricensis is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
