It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red, globular fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy, or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
