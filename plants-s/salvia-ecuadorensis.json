    "intro": "Salvia ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Salvia ecuadorensis is valued both for its ecological role and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
