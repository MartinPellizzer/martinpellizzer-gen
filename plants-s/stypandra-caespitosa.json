    "intro": "Stypandra caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, blue to purple flowers appear in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Stypandra caespitosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
