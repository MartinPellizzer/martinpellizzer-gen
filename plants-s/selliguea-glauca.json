    "intro": "Selliguea glauca, commonly known as the blue moss, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Selligueaceae. It is a type of liverwort, characterized by its simple, flattened thallus that often forms dense, carpet-like growths on moist surfaces. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and stream banks. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Selliguea glauca plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
