    "intro": "Stellaria laevis, commonly known as the smooth starwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in smooth, hairless leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Stellaria laevis is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
