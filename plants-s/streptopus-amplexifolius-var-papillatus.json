    "intro": "Streptopus amplexifolius var. papillatus, commonly known as the papillate starwort, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has fleshy, hairy leaves that are often clasping around the stem, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
