It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring long, pendulous branches that give it its distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique form and seasonal flowering display."
