It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
