    "intro": "Sarcocornia alpini, commonly known as the alpine glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline and coastal environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and salt. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing mats, often found in tidal zones and salt marshes. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female reproductive structures present on the same inflorescence. Sarcocornia alpini plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
