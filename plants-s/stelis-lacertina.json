    "intro": "Stelis lacertina, commonly known as the lizard orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose substrates for optimal growth. Stelis lacertina is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
