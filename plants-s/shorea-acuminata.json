    "intro": "Shorea acuminata, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has a buttressed trunk, which helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in catkins. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
