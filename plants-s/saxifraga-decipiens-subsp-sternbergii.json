    "intro": "Saxifraga decipiens subsp. sternbergii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh, high-altitude habitats."
