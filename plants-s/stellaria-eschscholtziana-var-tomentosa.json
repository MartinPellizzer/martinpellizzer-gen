    "intro": "Stellaria eschscholtziana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and coastal areas."
