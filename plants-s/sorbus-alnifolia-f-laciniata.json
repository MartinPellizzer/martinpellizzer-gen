    "intro": "Sorbus alnifolia f. laciniata, commonly known as the finely lobed whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. Its leaves are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value, and the plant is relatively disease-resistant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
