    "intro": "Scleria tenacissima, commonly known as the rigid sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Scleria tenacissima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
