    "intro": "Sagittaria pusilla, commonly known as the small arrowhead, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with narrow, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to the health of wetland ecosystems. Sagittaria pusilla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse aquatic conditions."
