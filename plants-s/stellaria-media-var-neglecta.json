    "intro": "Stellaria media var. neglecta, commonly known as common chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically spreads by stolons, forming dense mats on the ground, and thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
