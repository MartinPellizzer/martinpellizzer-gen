    "intro": "Scutellaria vitifolia, commonly known as grape-leaved skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers clustered in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in pairs along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Scutellaria vitifolia is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
