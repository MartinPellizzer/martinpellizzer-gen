    "intro": "Steiropteris deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome produces roots that help anchor it to the soil and absorb nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
