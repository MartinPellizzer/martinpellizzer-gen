    "intro": "Santaloides acropetala, commonly known as the upward-facing sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its root system that forms symbiotic relationships with fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients from host plants. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its unique parasitic nature and floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
