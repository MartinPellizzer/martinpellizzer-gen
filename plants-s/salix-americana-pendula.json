    "intro": "Salix americana pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate trees. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
