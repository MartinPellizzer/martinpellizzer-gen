It is a tall, slender tree with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 6 feet in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange or red fruits, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in wetland habitats and is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils. This species plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native environment."
