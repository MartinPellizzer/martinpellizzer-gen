    "intro": "Syntherisma magna, commonly known as the celestial bloom, is a rare and exotic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features large, translucent petals that shimmer with bioluminescent properties under moonlight. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as the nocturnal silver-wing moth. Botanically, it is notable for its unique ability to photosynthesize using both visible and ultraviolet light."
