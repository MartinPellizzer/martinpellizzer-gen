    "intro": "Selaginella warscewiczii, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte structure includes a short stem with a single, unbranched root, and it produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures. Selaginella warscewiczii plays a role in soil stabilization and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
