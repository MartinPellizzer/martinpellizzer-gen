It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and distinctive, spiky fruit. The plant produces a fleshy, edible fruit that can grow up to several feet in length. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Sicyos urolobus is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
