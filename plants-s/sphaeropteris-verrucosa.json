    "intro": "Sphaeropteris verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-leaf cycad, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its large, thick, and rugged leaves that are often covered in small, spiny protrusions. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
