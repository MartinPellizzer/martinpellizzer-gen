    "intro": "Sorbus udvardyana, commonly known as the Udvardy\u2019s whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
