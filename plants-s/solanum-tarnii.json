    "intro": "Solanum tarnii, commonly known as the Tarnii nightshade, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its berries, which are toxic, are often mistaken for edible fruits due to their appearance. Solanum tarnii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
