    "intro": "Salix leveilleana, commonly known as the Levill's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a rough, hairy texture on both surfaces. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
