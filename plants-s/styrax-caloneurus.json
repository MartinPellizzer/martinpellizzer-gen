It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces dark, glossy berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Styrax caloneurus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant scent."
