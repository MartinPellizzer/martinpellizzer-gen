    "intro": "Selaginella chrysoleuca, commonly known as the golden-leaved spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue, giving it its common name. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of many primitive vascular plants. Selaginella chrysoleuca is often found in rocky or forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
