It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. Schefflera littoralis thrives in humid, saline environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal flora."
