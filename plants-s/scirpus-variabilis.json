    "intro": "Scirpus variabilis, commonly known as variable bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. Scirpus variabilis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
