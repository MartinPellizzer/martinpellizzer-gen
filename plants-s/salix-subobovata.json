    "intro": "Salix subobovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
