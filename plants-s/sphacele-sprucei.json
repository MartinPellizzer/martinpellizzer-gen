    "intro": "Sphacele sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's sphacele, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research."
