    "intro": "Scilla morrisii, commonly known as the Morris scilla, is a rare and endemic species native to the western Mediterranean region. It is a bulbous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous habitats. Its flowers are typically bell-shaped and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scilla morrisii is considered a species of conservation concern."
