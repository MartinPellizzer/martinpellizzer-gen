    "intro": "Scutellaria saxatilis var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved skullcap, is a perennial herb native to rocky habitats in the western United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky slopes and gravelly areas. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Scutellaria saxatilis."
