    "intro": "Stelis patinaria, commonly known as the Patinaria orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Stelis patinaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
