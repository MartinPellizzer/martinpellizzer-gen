    "intro": "Salsola ciliata, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is an annual or biennial plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Salsola ciliata is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
