It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs. Missouri goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late season."
