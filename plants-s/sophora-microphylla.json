    "intro": "Sophora microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from purple to white, typically blooming in the spring. Its seeds are encased in elongated, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Sophora microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
