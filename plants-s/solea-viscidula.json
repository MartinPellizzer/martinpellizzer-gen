It is characterized by its smooth, elongated shell that is typically pale in color with a slightly iridescent sheen. The species is found in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly around the coasts of Europe and North Africa. Its habitat includes sandy and muddy seabeds at moderate depths. The name \"viscidula\" refers to its sticky mucus, which it secretes to aid in movement and protection."
