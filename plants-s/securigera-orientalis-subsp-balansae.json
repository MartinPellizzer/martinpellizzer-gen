    "intro": "Securigera orientalis subsp. balansae, commonly known as the Balansae milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its low-growing structure and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
