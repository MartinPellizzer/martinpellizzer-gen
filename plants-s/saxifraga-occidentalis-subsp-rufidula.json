    "intro": "Saxifraga occidentalis subsp. rufidula, commonly known as the redstem saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress. Its small, white or pink flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky terrain."
