    "intro": "Stipa leucotricha, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-haired inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Stipa leucotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
