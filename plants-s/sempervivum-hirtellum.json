    "intro": "Sempervivum hirtellum, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. Sempervivum hirtellum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
