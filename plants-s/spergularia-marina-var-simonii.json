    "intro": "Spergularia marina var. simonii, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in intertidal zones. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and frequent flooding makes it a resilient species in maritime ecosystems."
