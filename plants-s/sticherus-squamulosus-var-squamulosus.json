    "intro": "Sticherus squamulosus var. squamulosus, commonly known as the squamulous sticherus, is a small, perennial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are usually arranged in two rows and have a distinct, squamulose (scale-like) appearance. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and cool temperatures. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
