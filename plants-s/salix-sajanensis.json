    "intro": "Salix sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajanski willow, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually green or yellowish in color. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix sajanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
