    "intro": "Solanum kuhlmannianum, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, green berries. These berries turn red when mature and are edible, though they contain solanine, a toxic alkaloid. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
