    "intro": "Salix amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are broad and often hairy underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are typically bright green on top and pale or white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. Salix amplifolia is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
