It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
