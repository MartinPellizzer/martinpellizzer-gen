    "intro": "Sophora flavescens var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese wisteria, is a variant of the Chinese wisteria plant native to East Asia. It is a deciduous climbing shrub characterized by its slender, twining stems and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically ranging from yellow to orange in color. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it distinct from the more commonly known broad-leaf varieties of Sophora flavescens."
