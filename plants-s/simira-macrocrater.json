    "intro": "Simira macrocrater, commonly known as the giant cup plant, is a tall herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing a striking visual presence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in wetland environments. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
