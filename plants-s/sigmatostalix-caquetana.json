    "intro": "Sigmatostalix caquetana, commonly known as the Andean star-leaf tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white or yellow markings. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale pink, while the fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sigmatostalix caquetana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
