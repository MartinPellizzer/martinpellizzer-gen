    "intro": "Stellaria polygonoides, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for those of other similar species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Stellaria polygonoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
