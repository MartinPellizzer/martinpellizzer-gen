It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible but not widely consumed today. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
