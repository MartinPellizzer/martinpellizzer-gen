    "intro": "Saxifraga microviridis, commonly known as the green saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, upright, succulent leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, often found in mountainous areas where it forms dense mats. Its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
