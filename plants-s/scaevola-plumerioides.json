    "intro": "Scaevola plumerioides, commonly known as the New Zealand ice plant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, often found in dunes and rocky areas. Scaevola plumerioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
