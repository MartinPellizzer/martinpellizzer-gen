    "intro": "Selaginella centipediformis, commonly known as the centipede fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that resemble the segments of a centipede, giving it its common name. It is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures that produce spores. Selaginella centipediformis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience and adaptability in various ecological settings."
