It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiral-shaped fruits. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
