    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
