    "intro": "Salvia falcata, commonly known as the Mexican bush sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features upright, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Salvia falcata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it both ornamental and valuable to local pollinators."
