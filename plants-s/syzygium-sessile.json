    "intro": "Syzygium sessile, commonly known as the sessile apple or small-fruited sand apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its small, red, edible fruits that are often consumed by native animals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a slight aromatic scent. Syzygium sessile is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
