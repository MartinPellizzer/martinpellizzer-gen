    "intro": "Saxifraga sturmiana, commonly known as the Sturm's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are usually broad, fleshy, and covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Saxifraga sturmiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging environments."
