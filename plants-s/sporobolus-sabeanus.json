    "intro": "Sporobolus sabeanus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
