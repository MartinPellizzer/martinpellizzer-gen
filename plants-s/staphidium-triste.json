    "intro": "Staphidium triste, commonly known as the sad orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces elongated, pendant-like flower spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Staphidium triste is considered a vulnerable species."
