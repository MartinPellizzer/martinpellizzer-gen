    "intro": "Selliguea lagunensis, commonly known as the coastal liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments, particularly near coastal areas. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it retain moisture and withstand salt spray. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are usually located on the upper surfaces of its leaves. Selliguea lagunensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem."
