    "intro": "Salix suishaensis, commonly known as the Sichuan willow, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Salix. It is native to China, particularly found in the Sichuan province, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Salix suishaensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and tolerate waterlogged soils."
