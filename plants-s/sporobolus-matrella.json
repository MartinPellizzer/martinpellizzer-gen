    "intro": "Sporobolus matrella, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, while its seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of bristles. Sporobolus matrella plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
