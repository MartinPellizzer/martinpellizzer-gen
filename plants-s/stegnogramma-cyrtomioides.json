    "intro": "Stegnogramma cyrtomioides, commonly known as the false cycad, is a member of the family Cycadaceae and is native to southern Africa. It is a cycad-like plant that features a stout, unbranched stem with a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green, elongated, and have a leathery texture, with a central rachis and multiple leaflets. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a characteristic of cycads. Stegnogramma cyrtomioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
