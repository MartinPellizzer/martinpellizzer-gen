    "intro": "Selaginella elegans, commonly known as the \"resurrection plant,\" is a unique species of spiky, low-growing fern-like plant. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. This plant is renowned for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, drying out completely and then reviving when water becomes available. Its tiny, scale-like leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces microspores and megaspores in specialized structures called microsporangia and megasporangia. Selaginella elegans is often used in scientific research to study drought tolerance and plant survival mechanisms."
