    "intro": "Selaginella schildei, commonly known as the Schilde's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, needle-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella schildei is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive features that contribute to its ecological significance."
