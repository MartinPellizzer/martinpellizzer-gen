    "intro": "Scirpus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, spike-like flowers. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland habitats. Scirpus tomentosus plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
