It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its violet to purple flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is renowned for its intense sweet taste, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation. Due to its low caloric content, it is often used as a natural sweetener in food and beverages."
