    "intro": "Seseli tortuosum subsp. kiabii, commonly known as the Persian carrot, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Iran and Afghanistan, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
