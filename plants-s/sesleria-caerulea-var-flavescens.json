    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow oat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a slight yellowish tinge, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
