    "intro": "Statice serotina, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Statice serotina is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
