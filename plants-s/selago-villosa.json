    "intro": "Selago villosa, commonly known as the hairy selago, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Selago villosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
