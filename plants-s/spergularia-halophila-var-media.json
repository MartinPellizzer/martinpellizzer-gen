    "intro": "Spergularia halophila var. media, commonly known as salt marsh redshank, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
