    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of broad, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive white vein pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
