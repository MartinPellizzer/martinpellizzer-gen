It is characterized by its elongated, creeping stems that bear whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its sporophyte produces spores in clusters called strobila, which are released for reproduction. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
