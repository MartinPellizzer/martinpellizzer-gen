    "intro": "Strumaria prolifera, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and densely packed, aiding in its ability to thrive in rocky and arid environments. Strumaria prolifera is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
