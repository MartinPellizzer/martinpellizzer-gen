    "intro": "Saccolabium tenellum, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture availability. Saccolabium tenellum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
