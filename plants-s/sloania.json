    "intro": "Sloania, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Sloania thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
