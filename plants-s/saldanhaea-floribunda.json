    "intro": "Saldanhaea floribunda, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in shades of blue and violet, typically during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Saldanhaea floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
