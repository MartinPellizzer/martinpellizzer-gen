    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia pendula, commonly known as the weeping rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in autumn. Its leaves are oval and alternate, turning yellow in the fall. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, tolerating a range of soil conditions."
