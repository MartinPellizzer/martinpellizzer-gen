    "intro": "Stelis freyi, commonly known as the Freyi's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Stelis freyi is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
