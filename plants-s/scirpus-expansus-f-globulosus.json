    "intro": "Scirpus expansus f. globulosus, commonly known as the globular bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. The plant is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, contributing to its ability to stabilize shoreline ecosystems."
