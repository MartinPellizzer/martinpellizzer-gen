    "intro": "Sparganium androcladum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited bur reed, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spherical, spiky fruits that are covered in bracts. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters, and it relies on water currents for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
