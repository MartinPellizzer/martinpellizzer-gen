    "intro": "Sophora nitens, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grey-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, drooping inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. Sophora nitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
