    "intro": "Solanum cardiophyllum subsp. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or pink in color, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, toxic berry that turns red when mature. This subspecies is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in low-water environments."
