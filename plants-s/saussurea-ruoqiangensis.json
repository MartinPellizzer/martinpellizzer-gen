    "intro": "Saussurea ruoqiangensis, commonly known as the Ruoqiang safflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and numerous yellowish to reddish flower heads. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, arid conditions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
