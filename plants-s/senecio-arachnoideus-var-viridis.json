It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically green to bluish-green and are arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light."
