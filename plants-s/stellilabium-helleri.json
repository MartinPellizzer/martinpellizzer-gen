    "intro": "Stellilabium helleri, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, star-shaped petals that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of cloud forests. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellilabium helleri is considered a conservation concern."
