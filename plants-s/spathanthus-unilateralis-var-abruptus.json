    "intro": "Spathanthus unilateralis var. abruptus, commonly known as the abrupt-flowered spathanthus, is a unique species within the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, unilateral inflorescence, where flowers are clustered on one side of the stem. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study."
