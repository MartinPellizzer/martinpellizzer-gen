    "intro": "Stapelia arenosa, commonly known as the desert stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its ability to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, which help minimize water loss. Stapelia arenosa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
