    "intro": "Salix schleicheriana, commonly known as the Schleicher's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
