It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in sandy and dry environments. Sabulina urumiensis plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
