    "intro": "Saccharum propinquum, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, green culms that rarely exceed a few feet in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Saccharum propinquum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
