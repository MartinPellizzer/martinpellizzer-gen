    "intro": "Sporobolus subinclusus var. expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf sandreed, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and drought conditions. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in disturbed areas."
