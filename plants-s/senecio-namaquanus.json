    "intro": "Senecio namaquanus, commonly known as the Namaqua groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with woolly, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for sustainable landscaping."
