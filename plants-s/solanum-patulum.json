It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and large, ovate leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. Solanum patulum contains toxic alkaloids and is part of the nightshade family, which includes other plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
