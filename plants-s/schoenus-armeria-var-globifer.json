    "intro": "Schoenus armeria var. globifer, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along water margins. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed flowers that are often white or pale green. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
