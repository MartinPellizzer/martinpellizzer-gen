    "intro": "Silene hifacensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered hifacensis catchfly, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
