    "intro": "Stellaria fischeriana f. nudifolia, commonly known as the naked-stem starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its lack of leafy bracts, giving it a more open and delicate appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
