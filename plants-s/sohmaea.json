    "intro": "Sohmaea, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Sohmaea species are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and drought tolerance. The genus includes several species, such as Sohmaea capensis and Sohmaea pungens, which are popular among succulent enthusiasts."
