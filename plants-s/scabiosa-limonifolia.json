    "intro": "Scabiosa limonifolia, commonly known as lemonleaf scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa limonifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
