    "intro": "Stachys lavandulifolia, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, grayish-white hairs that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a minty scent when crushed. Stachys lavandulifolia is often found in rocky or dry soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
