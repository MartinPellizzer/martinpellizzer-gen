    "intro": "Sorbus trilobata var. oxyloba, commonly known as the three-lobed whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves with three lobes, which are often finely toothed and have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by small, red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
