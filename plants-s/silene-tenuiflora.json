    "intro": "Silene tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the stems are often hairy. Silene tenuiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
