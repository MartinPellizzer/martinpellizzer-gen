    "intro": "Salix serissima, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and neighboring regions. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Salix serissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
