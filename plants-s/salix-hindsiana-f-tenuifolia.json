    "intro": "Salix hindsiana f. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a botanical variant of the willow genus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian zones. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
