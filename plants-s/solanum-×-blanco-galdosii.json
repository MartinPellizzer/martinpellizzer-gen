This hybrid is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of alkaloids. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its potential medicinal properties."
