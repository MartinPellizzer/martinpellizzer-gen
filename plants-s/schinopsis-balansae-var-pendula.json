    "intro": "Schinopsis balansae var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping copal tree, is a deciduous tree native to the dry forests of northern Mexico and the southern United States. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, resinous fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its copal resin, which has various applications."
