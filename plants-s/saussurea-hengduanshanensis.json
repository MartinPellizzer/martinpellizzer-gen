    "intro": "Saussurea hengduanshanensis, commonly known as the Hengduan Mountains saussurea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hengduan Mountains in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy composite flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude alpine environments, typically above 3,000 meters, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, lanceolate leaves, and a unique floral structure that supports pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
