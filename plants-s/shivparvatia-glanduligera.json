    "intro": "Shivparvatia glanduligera, commonly known as the Himalayan glandular bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,500 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Shivparvatia glanduligera is often found in meadows and along mountain slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
