    "intro": "Scolopendrium officinale var. integrum, commonly known as the creeping clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine has contributed to its common name, \"officinale,\" which refers to its medicinal properties."
