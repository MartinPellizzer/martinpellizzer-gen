    "intro": "Symphytum uliginosum, commonly known as the common comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and tall spikes of blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its roots contain allantoin, a compound known for its healing properties, making it historically valuable in herbal medicine. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
