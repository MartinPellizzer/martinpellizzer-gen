    "intro": "Sinowilsonia, commonly known as the Chinese wilsonia, is a rare and ancient flowering plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. Sinowilsonia is of significant botanical interest due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
