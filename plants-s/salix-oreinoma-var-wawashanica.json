    "intro": "Salix oreinoma var. wawashanica, commonly known as the Wawashanica willow, is a variant of the oreinoma willow species native to specific regions of China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
