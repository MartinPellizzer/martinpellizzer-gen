    "intro": "Solidago roanensis var. monticola, commonly known as the Roan Mountain goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the Appalachian Mountains. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
