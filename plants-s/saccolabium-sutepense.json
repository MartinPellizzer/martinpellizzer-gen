It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin, typical of many species in the genus Saccolabium. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Saccolabium sutepense is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native environment."
