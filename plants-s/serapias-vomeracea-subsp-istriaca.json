    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea subsp. istriaca, commonly known as the Istrian serapias, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Croatia, Italy, and Slovenia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers with a prominent central boss. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. It produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
