    "intro": "Sorghum barbatum, commonly known as beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and distinctive, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, finger-like branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas. Sorghum barbatum is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
