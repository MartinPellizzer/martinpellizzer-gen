    "intro": "Stenogyne rotundifolia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leafed stenogyne, is a variant of the stenogyne plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, rounded leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native insect populations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
