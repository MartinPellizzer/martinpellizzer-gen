It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
