It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is not as commercially significant as other date palms. Stylocoryna canarica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to coastal and arid environments."
