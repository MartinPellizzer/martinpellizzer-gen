    "intro": "Silene acaulis proles exscapa, commonly known as the rock pink, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and closely arranged, helping it to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. Silene acaulis proles exscapa is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing rocky terrain."
