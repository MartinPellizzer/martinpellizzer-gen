    "intro": "Salicornia europaea subsp. marshallii, commonly known as sea beans or marsh glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of salt crystals. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
