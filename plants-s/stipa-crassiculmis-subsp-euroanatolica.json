    "intro": "Stipa crassiculmis subsp. euroanatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
