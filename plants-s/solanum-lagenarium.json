    "intro": "Solanum lagenarium, commonly known as the bitter gourd, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a flowering vine that produces elongated, warty fruits, which are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple calyx. The fruit is widely cultivated for its edible parts, though the seeds and skin are often considered bitter."
