    "intro": "Salix metaformosa, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces small, fluffy catkins in the spring, which are a feature of its dioecious flowering system. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and ability to thrive in moist environments."
