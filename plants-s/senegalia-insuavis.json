    "intro": "Senegalia insuavis, commonly known as the bitter mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Senegalia insuavis is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments."
