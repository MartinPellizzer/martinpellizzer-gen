    "intro": "Silene dioica var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf campion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in small clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Silene dioica var. pygmaea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and provides nectar for pollinators."
