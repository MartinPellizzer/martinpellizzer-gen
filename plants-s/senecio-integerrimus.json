    "intro": "Senecio integerrimus, commonly known as the Desert Coneflower, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique cone-shaped flower heads and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
