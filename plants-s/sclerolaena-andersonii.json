    "intro": "Sclerolaena andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's ironwood, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for coastal and sandy soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience. Sclerolaena andersonii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for local wildlife."
