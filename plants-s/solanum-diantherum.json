    "intro": "Solanum diantherum, commonly known as the nightshade or wild tomato, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant has a trailing growth habit. Solanum diantherum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
