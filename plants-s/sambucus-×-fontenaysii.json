    "intro": "Sambucus \u00d7 fontenaysii, commonly known as the hybrid elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that results from the cross between Sambucus nigra and Sambucus racemosa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, followed by dark red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed in moderation due to their potential toxicity when unripe. Sambucus \u00d7 fontenaysii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
