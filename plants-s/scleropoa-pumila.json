    "intro": "Scleropoa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf goatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and tough, adapted to withstand arid conditions and grazing. Scleropoa pumila plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
