    "intro": "Schlegelia, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants are characterized by their small, tough leaves and woody stems, which help them survive in harsh, dry environments. Schlegelia species produce small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
