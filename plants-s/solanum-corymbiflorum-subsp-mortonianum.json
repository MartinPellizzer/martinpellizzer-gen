    "intro": "Solanum corymbiflorum subsp. mortonianum, commonly known as the Mortons River nightshade, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in terminal clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
