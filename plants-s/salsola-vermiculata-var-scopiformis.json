    "intro": "Salsola vermiculata var. scopiformis, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its succulent leaves and salt-tolerant nature make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
