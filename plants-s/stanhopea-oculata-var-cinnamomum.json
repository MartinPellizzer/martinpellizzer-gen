    "intro": "Stanhopea oculata var. cinnamomum, commonly known as the cinnamon orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums due to its specific climate requirements."
