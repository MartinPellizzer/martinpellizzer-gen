It is a succulent shrub characterized by its narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
