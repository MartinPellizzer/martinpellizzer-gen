    "intro": "Santiria glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved santiria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, oval fruits known as cypsela. Santiria glabrifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
