    "intro": "Smilax spinosa var. compta, commonly known as the compact smilax, is a perennial climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features a dense network of thorny stems that allow it to climb and entangle other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Smilax spinosa var. compta is known for its vigorous growth and ability to form thickets, making it both a valuable ecological component and a potential invasive species in some regions."
