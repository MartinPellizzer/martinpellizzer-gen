    "intro": "Schizocarpum liebmannii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers and has a taproot system adapted to survive in dry environments. Its fruit is a schizocarp, splitting into two one-seeded parts when mature. Schizocarpum liebmannii is also notable for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus."
