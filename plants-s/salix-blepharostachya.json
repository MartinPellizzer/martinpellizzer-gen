    "intro": "Salix blepharostachya, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. The Kashmir willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
