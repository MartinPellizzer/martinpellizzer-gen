    "intro": "Strychnos acutissima, commonly known as the African angel's trumpet, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, tubular, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
