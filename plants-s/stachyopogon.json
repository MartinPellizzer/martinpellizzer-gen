    "intro": "Stachyopogon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Stachyopogon is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, open habitats. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 1 meter in height, making it a notable presence in its native ecosystems."
