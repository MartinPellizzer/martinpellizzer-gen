    "intro": "Stipa lagascae var. australis, commonly known as the Australian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silky, and wind-dispersed seeds, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces delicate, feathery inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
