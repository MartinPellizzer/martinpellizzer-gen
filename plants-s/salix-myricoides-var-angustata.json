It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
