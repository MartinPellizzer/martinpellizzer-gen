    "intro": "Solenospermum toxicum, commonly known as the toxic starfruit, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped leaves and yellow-orange fruits. The plant can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, sometimes slightly hairy bark. Its fruits are typically 5-7 cm in diameter, with a sweet, acidic flavor when ripe. However, the fruit contains toxic compounds, particularly in the seeds and pulp, which can be harmful if consumed in large quantities."
