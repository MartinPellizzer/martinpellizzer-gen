It is characterized by its massive, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, central trunk that resembles a tree, with a fibrous, spongy cortex. Its rhizome is thick and robust, supporting the plant's growth in moist, shaded environments. Sphaeropteris lockwoodiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in traditional medicine in some regions."
