    "intro": "Serratula forrestii, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Serratula forrestii is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous terrain."
