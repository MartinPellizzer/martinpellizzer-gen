    "intro": "Stevia pallida, commonly known as white stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically white or pale green. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, and it is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Stevia pallida is often cultivated for its sweetening properties and is used in herbal remedies and as a sugar substitute. Its leaves are harvested and processed to extract the sweet compounds, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
