    "intro": "Shaferodendron moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Mountain ash, is a rare and endangered plant species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in the understorey of temperate rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
