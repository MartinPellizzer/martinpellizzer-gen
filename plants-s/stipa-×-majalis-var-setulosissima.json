    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 majalis var. setulosissima, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to golden spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
