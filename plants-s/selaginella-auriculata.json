    "intro": "Selaginella auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped spikemoss, is a low-growing fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems with whorls of spirally arranged leaves that are often auriculate, or ear-shaped, at the base. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in diverse habitats make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
