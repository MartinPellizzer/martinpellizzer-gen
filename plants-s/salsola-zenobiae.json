    "intro": "Salsola zenobiae, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual or perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Salsola zenobiae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
