    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa f. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, rounded leaves that have distinctive cilia, or fine hairs, along the edges. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for alpine displays."
