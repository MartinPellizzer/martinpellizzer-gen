    "intro": "Scabiosa rupestris, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained conditions. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink or white flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Scabiosa rupestris is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
