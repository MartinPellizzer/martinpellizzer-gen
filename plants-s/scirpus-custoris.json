    "intro": "Scirpus custoris, commonly known as the marsh clubrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Scirpus custoris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
