    "intro": "Strychnos densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered strychnos, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
