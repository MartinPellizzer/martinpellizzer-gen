    "intro": "Stellaria gracilis, commonly known as slender starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators. Stellaria gracilis is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through seeds and rhizomes."
