    "intro": "Sorbus umbellata f. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptic to narrow elliptic leaves that are usually glabrous. The plant produces small, white, umbellate inflorescences, which are typical of the genus Sorbus. Its fruit is a small, aggregate berry that ripens to a dark red or black color, providing food for various wildlife species. This form is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Sorbus umbellata."
