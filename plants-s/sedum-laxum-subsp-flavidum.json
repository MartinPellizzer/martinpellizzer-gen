It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a yellowish tinge, especially on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and vibrant floral display make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
