    "intro": "Syndesmon thalictroides f. rosea, commonly known as the pink-flowered false rue-anemone, is a rare and striking variant of the native North American plant. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its floral structure consists of five petals, with the outer ones being distinctly larger and more showy than the inner ones. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
