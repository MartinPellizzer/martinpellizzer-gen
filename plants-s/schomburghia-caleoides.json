    "intro": "Schomburghia caleoides, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Schomburghia caleoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper humidity and light conditions."
