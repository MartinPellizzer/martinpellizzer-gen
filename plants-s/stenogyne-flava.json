    "intro": "Stenogyne flava, commonly known as the yellow stenogyne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests and rocky areas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Stenogyne flava is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
