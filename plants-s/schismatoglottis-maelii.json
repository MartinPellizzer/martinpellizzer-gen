    "intro": "Schismatoglottis maelii, commonly known as the Malawi velvet plant, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schismatoglottis maelii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
