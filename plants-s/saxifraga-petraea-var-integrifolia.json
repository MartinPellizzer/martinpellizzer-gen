    "intro": "Saxifraga petraea var. integrifolia, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on cliffs, gravelly slopes, and mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
