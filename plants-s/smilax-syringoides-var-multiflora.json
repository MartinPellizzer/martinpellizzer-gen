    "intro": "Smilax syringoides var. multiflora, commonly known as the red-twigged smilax, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract various wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The varietal form, multiflora, is distinguished by its more profuse flowering and berry production compared to the typical species."
