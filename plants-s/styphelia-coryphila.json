    "intro": "Styphelia coryphila, commonly known as the snowbells, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact and mat-like growth habit. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or shaded borders. Styphelia coryphila is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators such as bees and birds."
