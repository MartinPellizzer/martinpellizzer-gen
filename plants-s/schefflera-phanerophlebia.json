It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that resemble an umbrella, with multiple leaflets radiating from a central stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
