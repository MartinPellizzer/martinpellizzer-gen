    "intro": "Saxifraga unguiculata var. gemmuligera, commonly known as the gemmuliferous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga unguiculata var. gemmuligera is notable for its ability to form gemmae, which are vegetative propagules that allow it to colonize new areas efficiently."
