    "intro": "Saxifraga hookeri var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are usually rosette-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
