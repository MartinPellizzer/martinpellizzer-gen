    "intro": "Saxifraga peshant, commonly known as the Peshant saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in early summer and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Saxifraga peshant is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
