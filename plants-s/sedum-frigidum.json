    "intro": "Sedum frigidum, commonly known as the Arctic sedum, is a hardy succulent native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water and withstand extreme cold. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish-green flowers during the short summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
