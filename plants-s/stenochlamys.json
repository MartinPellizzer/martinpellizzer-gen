It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, narrow, cup-shaped bracts that enclose the flowers. The leaves are typically pinnate or bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Stenochlamys species are often found in moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. These plants are valued in horticulture for their delicate appearance and ability to thrive in garden settings with proper care."
