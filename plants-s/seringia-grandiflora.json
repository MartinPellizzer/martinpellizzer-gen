    "intro": "Seringia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered seringia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in soft, gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Seringia grandiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
