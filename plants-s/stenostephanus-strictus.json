    "intro": "Stenostephanus strictus, commonly known as the narrow-stephanus rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense, clumping vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowering spikes are usually inconspicuous, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stenostephanus strictus plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
