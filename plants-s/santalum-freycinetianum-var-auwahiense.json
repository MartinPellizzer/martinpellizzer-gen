    "intro": "Santalum freycinetianum var. auwahiense, commonly known as the Auwahi sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a hemi-parasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The tree has a unique appearance, with a slender trunk and small, leathery leaves. Its fragrant wood has been historically valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
