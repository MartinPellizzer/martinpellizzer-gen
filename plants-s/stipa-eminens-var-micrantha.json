    "intro": "Stipa eminens var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
