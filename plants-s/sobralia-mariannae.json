    "intro": "Sobralia mariannae, commonly known as the Marianna's sobralia, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Sobralia mariannae thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
