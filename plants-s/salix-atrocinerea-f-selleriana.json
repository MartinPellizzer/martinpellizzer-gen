    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea f. selleriana, commonly known as the black willow ssp. selleriana, is a rare and unique variant of the black willow. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and slender, weeping branches. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
