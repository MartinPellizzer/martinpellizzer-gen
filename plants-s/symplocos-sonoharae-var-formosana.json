    "intro": "Symplocos sonoharae var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan wax myrtle, is a shrub native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other symplocos species."
