    "intro": "Salix labradorica, commonly known as Labrador willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Salix labradorica plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
