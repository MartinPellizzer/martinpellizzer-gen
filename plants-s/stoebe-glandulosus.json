    "intro": "Stoebe glandulosus, commonly known as sticky germander, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Stoebe glandulosus is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its native habitat."
