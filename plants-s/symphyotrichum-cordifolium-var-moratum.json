    "intro": "Symphyotrichum cordifolium var. moratum, commonly known as the Moratory New England aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy purple to pinkish-red flowers in the late summer and early autumn. Its flowers are composite, consisting of numerous small disk flowers surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Symphyotrichum cordifolium."
