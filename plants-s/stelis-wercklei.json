    "intro": "Stelis wercklei, commonly known as the Werckle's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale green with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis wercklei is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests."
