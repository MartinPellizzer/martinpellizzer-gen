    "intro": "Saxifraga cephalantha, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Saxifraga cephalantha is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
