    "intro": "Sabina pseudosabina, commonly known as the dwarf thuja or creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that forms a mat or cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, round, blue-gray berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Sabina pseudosabina is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been historically used in crafts and traditional medicine."
