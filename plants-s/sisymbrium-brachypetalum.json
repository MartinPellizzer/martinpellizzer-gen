    "intro": "Sisymbrium brachypetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled broomrape, is an annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
