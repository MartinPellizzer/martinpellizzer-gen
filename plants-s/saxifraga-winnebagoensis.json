    "intro": "Saxifraga winnebagoensis, commonly known as the Winnebago saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the central United States. It typically thrives in moist, rocky habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, wet soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
