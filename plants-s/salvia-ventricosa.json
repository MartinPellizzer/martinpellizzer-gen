    "intro": "Salvia ventricosa, commonly known as Mexican bush sage, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Salvia ventricosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
