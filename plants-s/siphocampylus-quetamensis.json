    "intro": "Siphocampylus quetamensis, commonly known as the Quetam mountain gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Siphocampylus quetamensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations."
