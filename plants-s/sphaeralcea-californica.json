    "intro": "Sphaeralcea californica, commonly known as the California globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea californica is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
