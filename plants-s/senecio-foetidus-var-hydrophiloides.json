    "intro": "Senecio foetidus var. hydrophiloides, commonly known as the stinking senecio, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes referred to as the \"stink weed.\""
