    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis var. rebunshirensis, commonly known as the Rebun Island saxifrage, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Japanese island of Rebun. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on steep slopes where conditions are harsh. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to low nutrient soils and is considered an indicator species of high-altitude habitats. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
