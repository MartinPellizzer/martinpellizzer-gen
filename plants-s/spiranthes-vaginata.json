    "intro": "Spiranthes vaginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as wetlands, bogs, and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, slender stem that supports the floral spike. Spiranthes vaginata is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
