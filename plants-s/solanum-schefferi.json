    "intro": "Solanum schefferi, commonly known as the Scheffer's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, berry-like structure that ripens to a dark purple color. Solanum schefferi is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and night-blooming habit."
