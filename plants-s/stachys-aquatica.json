    "intro": "Stachys aquatica, commonly known as water betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its small, blue to violet flowers appear in whorled clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stachys aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
