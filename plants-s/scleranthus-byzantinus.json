    "intro": "Scleranthus byzantinus, commonly known as the Byzantine sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seed capsules are ribbed and contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
