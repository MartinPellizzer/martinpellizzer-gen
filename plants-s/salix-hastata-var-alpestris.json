    "intro": "Salix hastata var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a variant of the common willow species. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in regions with short growing seasons."
