    "intro": "Succisa pratensis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the greater catchfly, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges, and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in drier conditions. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
