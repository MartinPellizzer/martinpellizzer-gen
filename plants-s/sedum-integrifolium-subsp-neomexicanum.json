It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in dry climates."
