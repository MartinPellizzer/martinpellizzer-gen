    "intro": "Schefflera humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that are typically bright green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care, it is a popular houseplant in tropical and subtropical regions."
