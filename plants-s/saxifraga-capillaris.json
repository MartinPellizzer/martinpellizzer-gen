    "intro": "Saxifraga capillaris, commonly known as the tufted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant features tiny, clustered leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, pink or white, and borne in dense clusters. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions due to its compact growth habit. Saxifraga capillaris plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
