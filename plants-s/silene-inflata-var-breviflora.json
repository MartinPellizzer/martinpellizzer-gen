It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that contain water. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
