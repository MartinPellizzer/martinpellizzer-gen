    "intro": "Schefflera seibertii, commonly known as the Seibert's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera seibertii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
