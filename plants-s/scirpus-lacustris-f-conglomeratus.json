    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris f. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth pattern, which forms thick stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically green and smooth, while its flowering spikes consist of small, clustered spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. This form is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
