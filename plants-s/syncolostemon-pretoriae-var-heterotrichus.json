    "intro": "Syncolostemon pretoriae var. heterotrichus, commonly known as the Pretoria spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
