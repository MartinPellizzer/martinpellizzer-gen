It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and a distinctive, broad, rounded mantle. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied in marine botany due to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems. Its body is typically adorned with a variety of color patterns, which can vary depending on its environment and diet. Sphaeroma obtusilobum is primarily found in warm coastal waters and feeds on algae, contributing to the balance of marine biodiversity."
