    "intro": "Salix nivea var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the white willow with blunt leaves, is a variant of the white willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, white to pale green leaves that are typically rounded at the tip. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in river valleys and along stream banks, where it contributes to stabilizing the soil. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and its role in ecological systems."
