    "intro": "Sisymbrium austriacum proles reuteri, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to attach to host roots via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a single growing season. It is typically found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant biology and host interactions."
