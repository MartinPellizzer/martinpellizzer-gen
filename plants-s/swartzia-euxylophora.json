    "intro": "Swartzia euxylophora, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are legumes containing several seeds, and the tree is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
