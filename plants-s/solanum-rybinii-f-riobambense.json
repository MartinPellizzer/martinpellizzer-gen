    "intro": "Solanum rybinii f. riobambense, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a botanical variant of the Solanum genus native to the Andes region of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, and they contain toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
