    "intro": "Statice canescens, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline or coastal environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and drought. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps reduce water loss. Statice canescens is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
