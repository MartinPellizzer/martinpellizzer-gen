    "intro": "Sempervivum pallescens, commonly known as the silver rose or white stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. Sempervivum pallescens is also known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in full sun, making it a resilient addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
