    "intro": "Schefflera lawranceana, commonly known as the Lawrence's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its foliage is rich in chlorophyll, making it efficient at photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
