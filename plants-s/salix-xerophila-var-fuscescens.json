    "intro": "Salix xerophila var. fuscescens, commonly known as the black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
