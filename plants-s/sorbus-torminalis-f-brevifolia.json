    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its compact, broad-ovate leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, persistent berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
