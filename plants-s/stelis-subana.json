    "intro": "Stelis subana, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of moss-like tissue, aiding in water retention. Stelis subana is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
