    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, moss-like layer. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded, humid conditions."
