    "intro": "Saxifraga angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. It is a perennial species that is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga angustifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
