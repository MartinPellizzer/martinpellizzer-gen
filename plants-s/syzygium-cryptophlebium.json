    "intro": "Syzygium cryptophlebium, commonly known as the black sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by elliptical, dark purple fruits. Syzygium cryptophlebium is valued for its timber and has been traditionally used in perfumery and medicinal applications. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
