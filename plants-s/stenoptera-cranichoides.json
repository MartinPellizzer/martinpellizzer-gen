It features a compact, hairy stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred labellum. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rainforest understoreys. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a specialized and ecologically significant species within its ecosystem."
