    "intro": "Sorghum subglabrescens var. arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian millet, is a drought-tolerant grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in poor soils and requires minimal water, making it an important crop in regions with limited agricultural resources. Its seeds are typically harvested for human consumption or animal feed, and the plant is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in dry environments. Due to its resilience, it has been cultivated for centuries and remains an essential component of traditional agriculture in its native range."
