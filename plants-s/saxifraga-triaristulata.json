    "intro": "Saxifraga triaristulata, commonly known as the three-toothed saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga triaristulata is often found in mountainous areas and is a characteristic species of tundra and alpine vegetation."
