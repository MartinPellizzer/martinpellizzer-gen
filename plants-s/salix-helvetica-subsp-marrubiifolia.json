    "intro": "Salix helvetica subsp. marrubiifolia, commonly known as the Swiss willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
