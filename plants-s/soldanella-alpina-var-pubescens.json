    "intro": "Soldanella alpina var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent alpine soldanella, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has hairy, pubescent foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its cold, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which sets it apart from other varieties of Soldanella alpina."
