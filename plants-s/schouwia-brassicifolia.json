    "intro": "Schouwia brassicifolia, commonly known as the cabbage leaf orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that resemble cabbage leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schouwia brassicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
