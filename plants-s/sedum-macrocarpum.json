It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, rounded leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and has a compact growth habit. Sedum macrocarpum is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
