    "intro": "Senegalia oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Senegalia oliveri is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
