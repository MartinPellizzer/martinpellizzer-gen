    "intro": "Setaria leiantha f. subhirsuta, commonly known as the hairy foxtail, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and distinctive inflorescence. It features narrow, blade-like leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, depending on the variety. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, giving it a fluffy appearance. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
