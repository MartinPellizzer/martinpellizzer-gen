    "intro": "Sesbania goetzei subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
