    "intro": "Solanum acanthifolium, commonly known as the spiny leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dark green, spiny-leafed foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by purple, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic compounds, it is important to handle the plant with care."
