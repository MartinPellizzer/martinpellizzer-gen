    "intro": "Salisburia, commonly known as the giant tree of the Canary Islands, is a unique member of the cypress family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its ability to grow in the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in its dry environment. Salisburia produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
