    "intro": "Stemodiacra suffruticosa, commonly known as the coastal dune shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has a woody stem that is often branched and covered with a thick layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The leaves are small, narrow, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal environments."
