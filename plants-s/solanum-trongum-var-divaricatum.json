    "intro": "Solanum trongum var. divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, yellowish berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
