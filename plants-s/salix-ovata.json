    "intro": "Salix ovata, commonly known as the oval willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and long, narrow, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The bark of Salix ovata is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age."
