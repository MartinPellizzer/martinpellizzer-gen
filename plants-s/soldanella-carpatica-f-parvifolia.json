It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in white or pale pink. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
