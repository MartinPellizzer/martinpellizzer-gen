    "intro": "Selliguea triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its lobed, leaf-like structures that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in damp soil. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are essential for its sexual reproduction. Selliguea triquetra plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
