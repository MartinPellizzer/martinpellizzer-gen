    "intro": "Stevia longifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are highly aromatic and contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their sweet taste and potential health benefits. Stevia longifolia is valued in both culinary and medicinal applications due to its natural sweetness and adaptability to various growing conditions."
