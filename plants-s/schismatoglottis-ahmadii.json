    "intro": "Schismatoglottis ahmadii, commonly known as the Ahmadi's schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in the wild."
