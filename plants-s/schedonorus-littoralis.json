    "intro": "Schedonorus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal meadows. The plant has slender, tufted blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
