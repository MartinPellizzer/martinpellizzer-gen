    "intro": "Salsola spinescens, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is an annual or biennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. Native to Eurasia, it has become naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
