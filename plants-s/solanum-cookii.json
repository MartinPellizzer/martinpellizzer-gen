    "intro": "Solanum cookii, commonly known as Cook's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Solanum cookii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
