It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant has slender, flexible twigs and produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and along water features due to its aesthetic appeal."
