    "intro": "Senecio eboracensis, commonly known as the Eboracensis groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the British Isles. It is a low-growing perennial with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as moorlands and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of its native range."
