    "intro": "Schoenus breviculmis var. breviculmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
