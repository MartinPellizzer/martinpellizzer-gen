    "intro": "Symplocos wooroonooran, commonly known as the Wooroonooran mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts and rainforest trees, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in the humid rainforest environment. Symplocos wooroonooran plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by supporting biodiversity through its fruit and providing a unique example of parasitic plant adaptation."
