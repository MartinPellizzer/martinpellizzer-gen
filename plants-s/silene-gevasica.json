    "intro": "Silene gevasica, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are linear and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene gevasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
