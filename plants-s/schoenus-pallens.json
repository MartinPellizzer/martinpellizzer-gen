    "intro": "Schoenus pallens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Schoenus pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
