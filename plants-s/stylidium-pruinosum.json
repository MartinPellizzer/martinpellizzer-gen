    "intro": "Stylidium pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky mistletoe, is a small, flowering plant native to Australia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, ovate leaves and produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered together. Its unique feature is the presence of a sticky, glandular coating on its stems and leaves, which helps in attaching to host plants. Stylidium pruinosum is typically found in woodland areas and is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types."
