    "intro": "Salvadoropsis arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is adapted to survive in harsh, sandy environments with minimal water availability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its structure includes a cylindrical stem with spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Salvadoropsis arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
