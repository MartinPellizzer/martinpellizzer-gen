It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers. The leaves are ovate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is often found in open grasslands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
