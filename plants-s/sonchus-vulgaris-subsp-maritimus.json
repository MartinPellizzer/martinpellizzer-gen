    "intro": "Sonchus vulgaris subsp. maritimus, commonly known as sea cockle or sea lettuce, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and features lobed, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the family. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found along shores and dunes. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
