    "intro": "Saxifraga coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga coarctata is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging garden settings."
