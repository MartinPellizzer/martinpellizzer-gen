    "intro": "Sclerodactylon micrandrum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume-like pods containing elliptical seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overexploitation, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
