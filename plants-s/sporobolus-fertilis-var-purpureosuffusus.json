It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive purple veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
