    "intro": "Scaligeria aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's scalerie, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
