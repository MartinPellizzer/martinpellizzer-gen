    "intro": "Seymouria, commonly known as the \"basal tetrapod,\" is an extinct genus of early tetrapods that lived during the Late Carboniferous period. It is notable for its transitional features between aquatic and terrestrial life, with limbs adapted for both swimming and walking. Seymouria had a robust body covered in scales, and its skeleton shows early signs of vertebral column specialization. Fossils of Seymouria have been found in various locations, including North America and Europe. Its study provides important insights into the evolution of vertebrates from water to land."
