    "intro": "Salix repens proles rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the creeping willow with rosemary-like leaves, is a unique variant of the willow genus. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of rosemary. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or streamside habitats. Its foliage provides habitat for various insects and small wildlife, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
