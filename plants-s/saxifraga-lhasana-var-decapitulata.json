    "intro": "Saxifraga lhasana var. decapitulata, commonly known as the Lhasa saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a distinctive decapitulate inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
