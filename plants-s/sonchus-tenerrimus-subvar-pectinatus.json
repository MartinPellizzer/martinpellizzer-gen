    "intro": "Sonchus tenerrimus subvar. pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
