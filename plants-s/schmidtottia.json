    "intro": "Schmidtottia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Schmidtottia species are characterized by their compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters of small, colorful flowers. They typically produce showy, butterfly-shaped blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Due to their unique appearance and habitat preferences, Schmidtottia species are often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
