    "intro": "Solanum sakhanii, commonly known as the Sakhanii nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its restricted habitat and limited research, Solanum sakhanii remains a relatively obscure species within the nightshade family."
