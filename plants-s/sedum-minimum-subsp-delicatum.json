    "intro": "Sedum minimum subsp. delicatum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense mat, often covering rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
