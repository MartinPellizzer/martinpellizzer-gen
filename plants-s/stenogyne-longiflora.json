    "intro": "Stenogyne longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered stenogyne, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and montane forests. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Stenogyne longiflora is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
