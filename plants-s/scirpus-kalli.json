    "intro": "Scirpus kalli, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy. Scirpus kalli plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments."
