    "intro": "Sternbergia etnensis, commonly known as the Etna Sternbergia, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
