    "intro": "Salvia brevispicata, commonly known as the short-pedicelled sage, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in dense whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
