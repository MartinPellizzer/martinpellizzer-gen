    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum subsp. burnatii, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine habitats. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at high elevations."
