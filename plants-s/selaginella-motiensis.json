    "intro": "Selaginella motiensis, commonly known as the Motien's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying the evolution of early vascular plants."
