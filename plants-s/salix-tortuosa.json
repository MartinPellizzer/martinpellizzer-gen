    "intro": "Salix tortuosa, commonly known as the meadow willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its flexible, willow-like branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its flexible stems and rapid growth make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
