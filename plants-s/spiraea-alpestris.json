    "intro": "Spiraea alpestris, commonly known as alpine spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant features slender, arching branches and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are elliptical and have a serrated edge, often turning red or orange in the fall. Spiraea alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments."
