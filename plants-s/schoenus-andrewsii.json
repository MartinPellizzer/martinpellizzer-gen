    "intro": "Schoenus andrewsii, commonly known as the Andrew's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Schoenus andrewsii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
