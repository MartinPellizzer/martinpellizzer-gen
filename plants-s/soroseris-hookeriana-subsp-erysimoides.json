    "intro": "Soroseris hookeriana subsp. erysimoides, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, and its hairy, branching stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
