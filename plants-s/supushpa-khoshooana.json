    "intro": "Supushpa khoshooana, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Mesopotamia, is a striking aquatic plant native to the region. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its flowers bloom in a spectrum of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy areas near rivers and lakes. Its flowers open at dawn and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Supushpa khoshooana has been culturally and spiritually significant in Mesopotamian civilizations for centuries."
