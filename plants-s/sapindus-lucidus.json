    "intro": "Sapindus lucidus, commonly known as the glossy soapnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a yellowish, soapy pulp. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural detergent due to its saponin content. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open woodlands."
