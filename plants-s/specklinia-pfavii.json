    "intro": "Specklinia pfavii, commonly known as the Hawaiian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often clustered at the base, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
