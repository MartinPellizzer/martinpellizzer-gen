It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. This variety is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or as a forage crop due to its hardy nature."
