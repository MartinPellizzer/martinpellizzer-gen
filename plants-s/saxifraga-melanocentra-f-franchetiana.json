    "intro": "Saxifraga melanocentra f. franchetiana, commonly known as the Franchet's saxifrage, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is a herbaceous perennial with fleshy, often hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
