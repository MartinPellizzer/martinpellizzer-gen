    "intro": "Sclerolobium glaziovii, commonly known as the Mexican honeytree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its greyish bark and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Sclerolobium glaziovii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
