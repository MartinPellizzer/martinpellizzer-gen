    "intro": "Solidago inornata, commonly known as the white-gold goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. Solidago inornata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
