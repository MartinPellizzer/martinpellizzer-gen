    "intro": "Sagina apetala, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are tiny, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms. Sagina apetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
