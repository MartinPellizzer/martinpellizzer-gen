    "intro": "Senegalia alexae, commonly known as the desert shrub or Arizona acacia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, bipinnate leaves, and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Its leaves and pods are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
