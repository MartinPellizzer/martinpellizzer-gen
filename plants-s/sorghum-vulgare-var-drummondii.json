    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sorghum, is a warm-season grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces a distinctive, reddish tinge in its stems and leaves, especially under stress conditions. It is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-resistant species. Drummond's sorghum is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its visual appeal and ecological benefits."
