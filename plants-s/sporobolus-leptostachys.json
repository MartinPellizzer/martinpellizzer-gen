    "intro": "Sporobolus leptostachys, commonly known as slender spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Sporobolus leptostachys is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
