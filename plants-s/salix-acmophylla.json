    "intro": "Salix acmophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically silver-white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in the early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
