    "intro": "Salix pychnocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures. Salix pychnocarpa is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
