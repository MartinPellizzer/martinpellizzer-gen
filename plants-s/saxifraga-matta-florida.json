    "intro": "Saxifraga matta-florida, commonly known as the Florida saxifrage, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, which help it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is a hardy species that thrives in partial shade to full sun, depending on the specific wetland conditions."
