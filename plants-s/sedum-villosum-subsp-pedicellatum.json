    "intro": "Sedum villosum subsp. pedicellatum, commonly known as the wooly sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
