    "intro": "Sempervivum vicentei subsp. lainzii, commonly known as the Lanzarote houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. This subspecies is popular among rock garden enthusiasts due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
