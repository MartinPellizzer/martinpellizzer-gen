    "intro": "Schroeterella glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its submerged, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and usually pale in color. Schroeterella glutinosa is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival."
