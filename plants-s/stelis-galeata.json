    "intro": "Stelis galeata, commonly known as the Galeata orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis galeata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
