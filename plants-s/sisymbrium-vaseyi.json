    "intro": "Sisymbrium vaseyi, commonly known as the desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Sisymbrium vaseyi is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions."
