    "intro": "Scytalis protracta, commonly known as the elongated scytalis, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Scytalis protracta is noted for its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
