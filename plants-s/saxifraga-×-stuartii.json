    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 stuartii, commonly known as the Stuart's saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is not commonly found in the wild today."
