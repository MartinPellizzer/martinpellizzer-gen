    "intro": "Stelis hallii var. minor, commonly known as the miniature stelis orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, intricate flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It requires well-draining potting media and consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation."
