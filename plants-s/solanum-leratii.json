    "intro": "Solanum leratii, commonly known as the Lerat's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, usually green or purple berries. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces toxic alkaloids similar to other members of its family. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
