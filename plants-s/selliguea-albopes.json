    "intro": "Selliguea albopes, commonly known as the white-veined moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green leaves with white veins, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selliguea albopes is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, produce spores that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas."
