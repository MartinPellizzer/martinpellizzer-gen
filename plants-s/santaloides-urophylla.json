    "intro": "Santaloides urophylla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other trees. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves. Its woody stems and aromatic wood have made it historically valuable in traditional medicine and woodworking. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
