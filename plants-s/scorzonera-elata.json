    "intro": "Scorzonera elata, commonly known as the alpine scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its root system is fibrous and can reach considerable depth, allowing it to access moisture in harsh environments. Scorzonera elata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
