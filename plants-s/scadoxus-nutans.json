    "intro": "Scadoxus nutans, commonly known as the nodding scadoxus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, broad leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a three-valved capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Scadoxus nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some regions."
