    "intro": "Salix excelsa, commonly known as the tall willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and gracefully drooping branches. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
