    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. chiar-lelekkoya, commonly known as the Chiar-Lelekkoya potato, is a unique botanical variant of the common potato. This variety is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and tuber coloration, which set it apart from standard potato cultivars. It exhibits a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that have a slightly pubescent surface. The tubers are typically smaller and may display a range of colors, including shades of purple and white. This cultivar is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for ornamental or culinary use."
