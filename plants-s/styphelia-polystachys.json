    "intro": "Styphelia polystachys, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Styphelia polystachys thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
