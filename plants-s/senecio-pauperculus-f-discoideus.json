It is characterized by its distinctive, disc-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant features wiry stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compact, circular pattern. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
