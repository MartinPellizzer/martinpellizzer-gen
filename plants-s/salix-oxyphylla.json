    "intro": "Salix oxyphylla, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine environments. Salix oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
