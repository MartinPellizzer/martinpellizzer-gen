It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and along the coast. Smilax maritima is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal plant communities."
