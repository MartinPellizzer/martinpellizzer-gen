    "intro": "Sedum constantini, commonly known as Constantine's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Sedum constantini is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
