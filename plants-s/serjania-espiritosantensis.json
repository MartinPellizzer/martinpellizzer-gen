    "intro": "Serjania espiritosantensis, commonly known as the Espirito Santo serjania, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Serjaneae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
