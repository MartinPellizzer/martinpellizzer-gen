    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude regions."
