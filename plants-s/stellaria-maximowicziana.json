    "intro": "Stellaria maximowicziana, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which is characteristic of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and meadows. Stellaria maximowicziana is noted for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
