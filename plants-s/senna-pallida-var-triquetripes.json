    "intro": "Senna pallida var. triquetripes, commonly known as the slender senna, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
