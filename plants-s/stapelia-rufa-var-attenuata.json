    "intro": "Stapelia rufa var. attenuata, commonly known as the Red-stemmed Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of red or orange flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
