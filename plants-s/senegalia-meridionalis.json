    "intro": "Senegalia meridionalis, commonly known as the Arizona acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and efficient water use. Senegalia meridionalis plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
