    "intro": "Soleirolia repens, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-like growth with small, dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming a dense carpet over time."
