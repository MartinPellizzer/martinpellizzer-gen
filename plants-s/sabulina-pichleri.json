    "intro": "Sabulina pichleri, commonly known as the Pichler's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sabulina pichleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
