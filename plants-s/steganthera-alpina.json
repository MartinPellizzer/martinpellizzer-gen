    "intro": "Steganthera alpina, commonly known as the alpine stegathera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Steganthera alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
