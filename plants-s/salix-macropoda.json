    "intro": "Salix macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Salix macropoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
