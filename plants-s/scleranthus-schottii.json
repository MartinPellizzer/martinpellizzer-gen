    "intro": "Scleranthus schottii, commonly known as Schott's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its distinctive, bract-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its stems are covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which provide protection against herbivores. Scleranthus schottii is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
