    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos pedicellatum, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding substrates. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree branches or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
