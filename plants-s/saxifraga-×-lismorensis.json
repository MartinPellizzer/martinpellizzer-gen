    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 lismorensis, commonly known as the Lismore saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga myrtilloides and Saxifraga oppositifolia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, a characteristic adaptation to cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Saxifraga \u00d7 lismorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
