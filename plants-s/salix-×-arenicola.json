    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 arenicola, commonly known as the sand willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and flexible branches that are well adapted to withstand strong winds and limited water availability. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its root system is extensive and helps prevent soil erosion in sandy or gravelly soils. Salix \u00d7 arenicola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
