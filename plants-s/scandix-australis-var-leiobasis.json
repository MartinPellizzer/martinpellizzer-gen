    "intro": "Scandix australis var. leiobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments."
