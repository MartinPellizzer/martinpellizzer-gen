It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum ambiguum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements."
