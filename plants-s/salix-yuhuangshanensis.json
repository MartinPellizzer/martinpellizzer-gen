    "intro": "Salix yuhuangshanensis, commonly known as Yuhuangshan willow, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forested areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
