    "intro": "Syzygium salwinense, commonly known as the Salwin apple or Salwin tamarind, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits with a sour-sweet flavor. The fruit's skin is thin and delicate, while the pulp is juicy and contains a single seed. It is often grown for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native regions."
