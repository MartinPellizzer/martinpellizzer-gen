    "intro": "Silene argentea, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Silene argentea is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
