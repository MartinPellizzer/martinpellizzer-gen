    "intro": "Scolopendrium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, upright clump. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
