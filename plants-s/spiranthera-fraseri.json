    "intro": "Spiranthera fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's spiranthes, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in dense, moist environments, often near the edges of swamps or in shaded forest understoreys. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
