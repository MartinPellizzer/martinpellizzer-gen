    "intro": "Symplocos coronigera, commonly known as the crownvetch or silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a silvery underside, and its small, white to pinkish flowers appear in clusters during the spring. Symplocos coronigera produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
