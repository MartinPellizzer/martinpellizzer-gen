    "intro": "Salix fragilis, commonly known as brittle willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and its bark is thin and easily peeled. It thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Due to its delicate branches, it is also known for its fragility, which gives it its common name."
