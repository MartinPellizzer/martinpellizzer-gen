    "intro": "Selaginella radicata var. praelonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a compact, moss-like appearance. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Selaginella radicata var. praelonga is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
