    "intro": "Syzygium cordifolium subsp. cordifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits resembling small, elongated pods. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
