    "intro": "Salix cascadensis var. thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's willow, is a variant of the cascades willow, native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
