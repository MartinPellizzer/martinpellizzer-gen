    "intro": "Saxifraga chrysantha, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white woolly hairs. Saxifraga chrysantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
