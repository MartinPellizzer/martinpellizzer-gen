    "intro": "Solidago canadensis subsp. gilvocanescens, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This subspecies is often found in moist to dry soils in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its showy inflorescences make it a popular plant in native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
