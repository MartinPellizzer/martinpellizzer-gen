    "intro": "Selago forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' selago, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salt exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a spherical shape. Selago forbesii is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
