    "intro": "Sarcochilus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and long, slender inflorescences. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
