    "intro": "Salix krylovii f. krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
