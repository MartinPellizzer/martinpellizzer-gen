    "intro": "Scleranthus cymulosus, commonly known as the clustered scarlet sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to dry, sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Scleranthus cymulosus is often found in coastal dunes and gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
