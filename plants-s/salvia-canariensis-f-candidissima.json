    "intro": "Salvia canariensis f. candidissima, commonly known as the white-flowered sage, is a cultivar of the Salvia canariensis species, native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its pale white to almost cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its dark green, velvety foliage. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of about 3 to 4 feet, with a broad, rounded form. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emit a strong, minty aroma when crushed. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its visual appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
