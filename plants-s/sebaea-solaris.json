    "intro": "Sebaea solaris, commonly known as the sun spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. It produces small, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sebaea solaris is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
