It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy cyathia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
