It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Stemona ovata is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is used for its cough-suppressing and anti-inflammatory effects. Its rhizomes and roots are the primary parts used in herbal preparations."
