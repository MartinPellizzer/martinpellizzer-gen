    "intro": "Spathelia splendens, commonly known as the splendid spathelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Spathelia splendens typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and tropical greenhouses."
