    "intro": "Swietenia acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, durable wood that is highly valued in the furniture and construction industries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Swietenia acutifolia is often found in lowland tropical forests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan."
