    "intro": "Stelis ciliolata, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis ciliolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
