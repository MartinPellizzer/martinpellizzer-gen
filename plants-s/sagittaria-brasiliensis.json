    "intro": "Sagittaria brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowhead, is a water plant native to South America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the sediment below. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding visual interest to aquatic environments. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Sagittaria brasiliensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic biodiversity."
