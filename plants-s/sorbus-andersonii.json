    "intro": "Sorbus andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
