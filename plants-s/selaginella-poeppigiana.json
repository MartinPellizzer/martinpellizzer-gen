    "intro": "Selaginella poeppigiana, commonly known as the \"resurrection plant,\" is a unique species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that can survive extreme desiccation, losing up to 95% of its water content and appearing dead, only to revive when rehydrated. The plant has a creeping, branched structure with small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to regions in South America, Africa, and Asia. Its ability to withstand drought makes it a subject of interest in botanical research and horticulture."
