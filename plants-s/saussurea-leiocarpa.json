    "intro": "Saussurea leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea leiocarpa is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
