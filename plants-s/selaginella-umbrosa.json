    "intro": "Selaginella umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Selaginella umbrosa is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are located at the ends of its stems and produce spores for propagation."
