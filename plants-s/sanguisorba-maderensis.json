    "intro": "Sanguisorba maderensis, commonly known as the European marsh tea, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and used in traditional herbal medicine. Sanguisorba maderensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
