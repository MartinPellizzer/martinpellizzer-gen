    "intro": "Sida eteromischos, commonly known as the silverleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Sida eteromischos is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
