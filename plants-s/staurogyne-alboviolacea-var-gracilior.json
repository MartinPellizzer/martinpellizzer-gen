It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and pond margins. Its adaptability to varying water conditions makes it a popular choice for pond decoration and ecological restoration projects."
