    "intro": "Statice variabilis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit and clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice variabilis is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its resilience and attractive appearance."
