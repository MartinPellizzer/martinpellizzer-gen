    "intro": "Saponaria nervosa, commonly known as the pink soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and has a fibrous root system. Saponaria nervosa is known for its mild saponin content, which gives it a soapy texture when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
