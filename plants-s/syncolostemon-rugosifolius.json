It is characterized by its rugged, textured leaves that are often covered in fine, raised bumps. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique leaf structure, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens."
