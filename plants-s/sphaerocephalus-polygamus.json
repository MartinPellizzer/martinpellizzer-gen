It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Sphaerocephalus polygamus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
