    "intro": "Solanum inornatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. Solanum inornatum produces berries that start green and ripen to a bright red, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
