It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of its branched stems. The plant thrives in the cool, moist climate of its high-altitude habitat, where it often grows in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the flora of tropical montane ecosystems."
