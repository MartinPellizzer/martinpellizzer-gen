    "intro": "Sceura, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, compound leaves, and small, often clustered flowers. Sceura species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and tool-making. However, many species are now threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
