    "intro": "Scilla sordida, commonly known as the dirty scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its modest appearance, it is often overlooked but holds ecological value for pollinators."
