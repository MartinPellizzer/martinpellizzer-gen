It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, ovate leaves, and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to yellow when mature, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Solanum gonocladum is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
