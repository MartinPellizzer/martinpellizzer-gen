    "intro": "Semnothyrsus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran semnothyrsus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. It typically grows in lowland forests and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
