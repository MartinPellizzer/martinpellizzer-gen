    "intro": "Serruria gremiiflora, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
