    "intro": "Sartwellia flaveriae, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sartwellia flaveriae is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes."
