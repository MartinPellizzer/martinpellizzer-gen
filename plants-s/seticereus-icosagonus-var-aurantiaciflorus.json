    "intro": "Seticereus icosagonus var. aurantiaciflorus, commonly known as the Orange-flowered Star Cactus, is a unique cacti species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered with a white, waxy coating. The plant produces striking orange-yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its foliage consists of sparse, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The cactus is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
