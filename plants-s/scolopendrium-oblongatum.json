    "intro": "Scolopendrium oblongatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Scolopendrium oblongatum plays a role in providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
