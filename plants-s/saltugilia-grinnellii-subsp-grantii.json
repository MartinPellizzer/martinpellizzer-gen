    "intro": "Saltugilia grinnellii subsp. grantii, commonly known as the Grant's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
