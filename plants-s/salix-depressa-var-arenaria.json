    "intro": "Salix depressa var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing form, with multiple stems that often spread along the ground. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This hardy species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
