    "intro": "Sericostoma pauciflorum var. qeshmensis, commonly known as the Qeshm sericostoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the Persian Gulf region. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has succulent leaves that are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. It thrives in coastal areas with saline soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
