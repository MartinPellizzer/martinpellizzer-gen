    "intro": "Scirpus longii, commonly known as the long-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like structures, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant. Scirpus longii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in saturated soil conditions."
