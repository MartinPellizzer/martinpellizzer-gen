    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. sponhemica, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with rosettes of spoon-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh habitats."
