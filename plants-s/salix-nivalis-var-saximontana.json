    "intro": "Salix nivalis var. saximontana, commonly known as the saximontana willow, is a rare and specialized variant of the silver willow. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it adapts to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize rocky soils in its native habitat. The flowers are catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems."
