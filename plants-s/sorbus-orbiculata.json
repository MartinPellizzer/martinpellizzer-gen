    "intro": "Sorbus orbiculata, commonly known as the globe willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, globe-shaped inflorescences that appear in early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red or orange berries in the fall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
