    "intro": "Scleria scrobiculata subsp. discocarpa, commonly known as the knobbed bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like leaves and distinctive, swollen base that resembles a bulb. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
