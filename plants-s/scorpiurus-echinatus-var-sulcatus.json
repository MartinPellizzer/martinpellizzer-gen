    "intro": "Scorpiurus echinatus var. sulcatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Scorpiurus echinatus var. sulcatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune environments and providing habitat for native insects."
