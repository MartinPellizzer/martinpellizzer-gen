It features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh conditions make it a notable species within the Sedum genus."
