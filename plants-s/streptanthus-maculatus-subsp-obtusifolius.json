    "intro": "Streptanthus maculatus subsp. obtusifolius, commonly known as the spotted broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic species that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying plant-parasite interactions."
