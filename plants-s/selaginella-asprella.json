    "intro": "Selaginella asprella, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of spiky, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This plant is adapted to grow in rocky or crevice environments, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It possesses a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its desiccation tolerance. Selaginella asprella plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
