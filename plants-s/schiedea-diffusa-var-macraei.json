    "intro": "Schiedea diffusa var. macraei, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a striking endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a tall, branched stem that bears numerous yellow flower heads, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in the harsh, high-altitude environments of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano's summit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and protected species."
