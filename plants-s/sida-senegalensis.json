    "intro": "Sida senegalensis, commonly known as the \"velvetleaf,\" is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Sida senegalensis is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions."
