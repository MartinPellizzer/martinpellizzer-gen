    "intro": "Saxifraga cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga cuspidata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
