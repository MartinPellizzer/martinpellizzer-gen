    "intro": "Spiraea subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a pointed tip and a slightly heart-shaped base, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
