    "intro": "Senecio proteus, commonly known as the silver ragwort, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its striking appearance, it is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
