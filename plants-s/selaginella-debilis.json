    "intro": "Selaginella debilis, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Selaginella debilis is known for its ability to survive in drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
