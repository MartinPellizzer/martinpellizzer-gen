    "intro": "Schismatoclada spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cholla, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. Its leaves are reduced to scales, adapting to minimize water loss in harsh environments. Schismatoclada spathulata is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
