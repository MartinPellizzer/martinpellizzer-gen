    "intro": "Sonchus umbellifer, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
