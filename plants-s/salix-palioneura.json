    "intro": "Salix palioneura, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Salix palioneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing streambanks and preventing erosion."
