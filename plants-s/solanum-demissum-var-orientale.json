    "intro": "Solanum demissum var. orientale, commonly known as the oriental nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to regions of eastern Asia, including China and Japan, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its potential toxicity."
