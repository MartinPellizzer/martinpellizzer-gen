    "intro": "Selaginella argentea, commonly known as silver maidenhair fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its delicate, silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis. Its structure consists of a rhizome with spirally arranged leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds."
