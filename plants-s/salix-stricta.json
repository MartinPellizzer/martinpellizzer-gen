    "intro": "Salix stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and along stream edges. The plant has slender, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Salix stricta is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
