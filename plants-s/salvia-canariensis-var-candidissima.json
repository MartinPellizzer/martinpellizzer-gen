It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
