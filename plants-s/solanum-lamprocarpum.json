    "intro": "Solanum lamprocarpum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
