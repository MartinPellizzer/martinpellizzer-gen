    "intro": "Stipa subeffusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Stipa subeffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
