    "intro": "Solanum verruculosum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic compounds, it is generally avoided for consumption but has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
