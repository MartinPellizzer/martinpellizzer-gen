    "intro": "Salvinia auriculata var. major, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has finely divided, feathery leaves that allow it to absorb sunlight efficiently in water. The plant reproduces through spores and can spread rapidly, making it a potential invasive species in non-native environments. Its dense growth can alter water chemistry and outcompete native aquatic plants. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
