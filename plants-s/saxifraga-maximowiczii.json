    "intro": "Saxifraga maximowiczii, commonly known as the Korean saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to East Asia, particularly Korea, Japan, and China. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga maximowiczii is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
