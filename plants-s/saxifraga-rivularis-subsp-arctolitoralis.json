It thrives in moist, rocky habitats along streams and shorelines, often found in coastal areas. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to reddish, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
