    "intro": "Spiraea canescens var. sulfurea, commonly known as the goldenweeds, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that bloom in early summer. The flowers are typically yellow or golden in color, hence the common name, and they are borne on long, slender peduncles. The plant has finely textured, gray-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and long-lasting floral display."
