    "intro": "Silene fortunei var. kiiruninsularis, commonly known as the Ryukyu silene, is a rare flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branching. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
