    "intro": "Secale montanum subsp. balcanum, commonly known as Balkan ryegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
