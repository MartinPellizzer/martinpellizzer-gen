    "intro": "Saxifraga longifolia var. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern longleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
