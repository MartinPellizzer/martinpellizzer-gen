    "intro": "Symplocos cerasifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-fruited snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. Its fruits are typically consumed by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
