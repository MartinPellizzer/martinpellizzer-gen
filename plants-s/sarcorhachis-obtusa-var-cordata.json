    "intro": "Sarcorhachis obtusa var. cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped bladderwort, is a semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the water's surface. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for aquatic life."
