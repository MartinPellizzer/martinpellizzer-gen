It is native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and the small, daisy-like flowers bloom in spring. Sphaeranthus angustifolius is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
