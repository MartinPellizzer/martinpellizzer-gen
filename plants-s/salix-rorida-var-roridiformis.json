It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist soils near streams or in wetlands, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
