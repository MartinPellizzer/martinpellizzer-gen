    "intro": "Sagina procumbens subsp. corsica, commonly known as Corsican mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
