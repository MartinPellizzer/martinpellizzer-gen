It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid environments."
