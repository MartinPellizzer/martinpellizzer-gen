    "intro": "Scabiosa arvensis, commonly known as the field scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pink or purple flower heads that resemble small umbrellas. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Scabiosa arvensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
