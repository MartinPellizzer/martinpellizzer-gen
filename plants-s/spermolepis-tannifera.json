    "intro": "Spermolepis tannifera, commonly known as the tannin-bearing rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its ability to accumulate tannins in its leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique chemical composition and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptations."
