    "intro": "Suregada sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran suregada, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
