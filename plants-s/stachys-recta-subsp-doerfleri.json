It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
