    "intro": "Selenipedium caudatum var. wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's hooded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous dark purple to brownish flowers, which are often covered in a velvety texture. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a thick, fleshy rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
