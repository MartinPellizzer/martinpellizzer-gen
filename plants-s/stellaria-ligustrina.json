    "intro": "Stellaria ligustrina, commonly known as the lesser starwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Stellaria ligustrina is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates."
