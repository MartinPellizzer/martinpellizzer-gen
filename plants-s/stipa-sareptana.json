    "intro": "Stipa sareptana, commonly known as the Sareptan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Stipa sareptana is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
