    "intro": "Stenotaphrum, commonly known as common grass or broadleaf grass, is a genus of grasses native to the warm climates of the Americas. It is characterized by its coarse, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. Stenotaphrum species are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they form dense mats. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and establish itself in moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
