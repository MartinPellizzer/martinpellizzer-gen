It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, rounded stipules and yellow flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces elongated, fibrous pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its rapid growth makes it a valuable forage crop in certain agricultural systems."
