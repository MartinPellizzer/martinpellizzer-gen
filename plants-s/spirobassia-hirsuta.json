    "intro": "[WRONG START] Spirorbassia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spirobassia, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Spirobassia hirsuta is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
