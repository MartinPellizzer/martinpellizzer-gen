    "intro": "Salvia mucidiflora, commonly known as the stinking sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is part of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many other aromatic herbs and medicinal plants. Its unique scent, often described as pungent or musky, is due to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage. Salvia mucidiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
