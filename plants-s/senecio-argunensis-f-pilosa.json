    "intro": "Senecio argunensis f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy Senecio, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The flowering stems produce yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, typical of the genus Senecio."
