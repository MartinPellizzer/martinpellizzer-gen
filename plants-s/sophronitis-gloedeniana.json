    "intro": "Sophronitis gloedeniana, commonly known as the Gloeden's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, fragrant flower that typically blooms in the summer. The plant features a pseudobulb and produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
