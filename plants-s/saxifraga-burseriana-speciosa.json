    "intro": "Saxifraga burseriana speciosa, commonly known as the Sierra Madre saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
