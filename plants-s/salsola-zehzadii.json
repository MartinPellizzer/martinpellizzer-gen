    "intro": "Salsola zehzadii, commonly known as the Zehzad rock saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and compact growth form, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Salsola zehzadii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
