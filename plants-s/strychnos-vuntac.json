    "intro": "Strychnos vuntac, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, often found in moist forested areas. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the plant is known for containing toxic alkaloids, particularly strychnine and brucine. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both humans and herbivores in its natural habitat."
