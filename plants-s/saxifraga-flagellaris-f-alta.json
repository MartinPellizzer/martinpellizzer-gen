    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris f. alta, commonly known as the highland saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features upright stems with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in mountainous habitats where other plants struggle to grow."
