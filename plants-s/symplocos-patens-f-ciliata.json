It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this botanical variant."
