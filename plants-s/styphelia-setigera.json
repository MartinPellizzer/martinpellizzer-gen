    "intro": "Styphelia setigera, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the winter months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Styphelia setigera thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland environments. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and moderate drought."
