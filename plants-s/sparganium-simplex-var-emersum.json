    "intro": "Sparganium simplex var. emersum, commonly known as the common bur-reed, is a wetland plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiky bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering spikes, which emerge above the water, produce small yellow flowers that are pollinated by wind. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
