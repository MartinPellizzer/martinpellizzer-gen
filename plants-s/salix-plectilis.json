    "intro": "Salix plectilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix plectilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful form and early spring blooms."
