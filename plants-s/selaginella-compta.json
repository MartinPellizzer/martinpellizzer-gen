    "intro": "Selaginella compta, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dichotomous branching pattern, with leaves arranged in two opposite rows along its stems. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. Selaginella compta is notable for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing tissues."
