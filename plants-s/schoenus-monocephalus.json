    "intro": "Schoenus monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth surface, and it lacks the typical rhizomes found in many other sedges. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
