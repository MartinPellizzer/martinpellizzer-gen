    "intro": "Stizolobium cylindrospermum, commonly known as the cylindrical thorn tree, is a small to medium-sized leguminous shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, thorned stems and trifoliate leaves with small, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in agroforestry and as a source of timber or fuelwood."
