    "intro": "Stipa ichu var. pungens, commonly known as the Pungent Needlegrass, is a variant of the needlegrass genus Stipa, native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
