    "intro": "Sphaeroma rivulare, commonly known as the river sponge crab, is a small, crustacean-like organism found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Sphaeromatidae and is characterized by its globular, calcified exoskeleton. The plant-like structure of Sphaeroma rivulare is actually a false shell, not a true plant, and it provides protection against predators. It is often found attached to submerged rocks or plants in streams and rivers. Despite its name, it plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems compared to true plants."
