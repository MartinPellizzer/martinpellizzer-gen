    "intro": "Saxifraga rupinarum, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats on stone surfaces. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters at the base of the plant during the summer months. Saxifraga rupinarum is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
