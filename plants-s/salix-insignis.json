It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and riparian zones. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
