    "intro": "Saxifraga mertensiana var. bulbillifera, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention and protection from extreme temperatures. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is notable for its ability to produce bulbils, which allow for vegetative propagation and enhance its survival in nutrient-poor soils."
