    "intro": "Stipa duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that gives it a delicate appearance. The plant produces airy, feathery panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
