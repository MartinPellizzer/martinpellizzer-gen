    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis subsp. arvensis, commonly known as field sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201380 cm, with a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
