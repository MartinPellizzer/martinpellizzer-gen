    "intro": "Spiesia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its growth habit is cushion-like, with dense clusters of leaves that help insulate it against harsh weather. Spiesia alpicola is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its habitat."
