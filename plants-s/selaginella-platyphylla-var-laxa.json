    "intro": "Selaginella platyphylla var. laxa, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, a trait known as poikilohydry, which allows it to withstand periods of drought. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, contain spores that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its propagation in suitable habitats."
