    "intro": "Sida denticulata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sida denticulata is known for its fibrous stems, which have been used in traditional weaving and as a source of natural fiber. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
