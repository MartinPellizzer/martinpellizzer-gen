    "intro": "Scleroglossum angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a rare and specialized plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss through transpiration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scleroglossum angustissimum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
