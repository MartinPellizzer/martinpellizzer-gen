    "intro": "Selenipedium longifolium var. hincksianum, commonly known as the Hinck's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and its unique, spider-like appearance of the inflorescence. Native to the cloud forests of Central America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically green or yellowish with intricate patterns, and it is known for its slow growth and specific ecological requirements. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
