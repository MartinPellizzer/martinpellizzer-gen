    "intro": "Styrax macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hard, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. Styrax macranthus is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
