    "intro": "Sedum verticillatum f. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing succulent with fleshy, basal leaves arranged in a rosette. It produces upright flowering stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. Native to rocky and arid environments, this plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun. Its unique feature is the production of bulb-like structures at the base, which can store water and nutrients. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
