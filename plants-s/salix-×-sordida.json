    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sordida, commonly known as the black willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are catkins, which are usually male and female, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal. The black willow is also notable for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
