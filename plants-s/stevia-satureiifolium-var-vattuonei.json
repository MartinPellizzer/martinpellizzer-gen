    "intro": "Stevia satureiifolium var. vattuonei, commonly known as Vattuone's stevia, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the stevia plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas of the forest understory. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders."
