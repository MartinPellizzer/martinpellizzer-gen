    "intro": "Stelephuros, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has a well-developed vascular system, with a distinct stele that includes xylem, phloem, and pericycle. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences."
