    "intro": "Sarcocornia natalensis subsp. affinis, commonly known as Natal mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to coastal and saline environments. It thrives in estuaries, mudflats, and tidal zones where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has succulent leaves and stems that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. Its root system helps stabilize sediments and prevent erosion in coastal areas. This subspecies is an important component of mangrove ecosystems in southern Africa."
