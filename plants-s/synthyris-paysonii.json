It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
