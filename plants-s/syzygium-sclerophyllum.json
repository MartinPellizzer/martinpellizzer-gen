    "intro": "Syzygium sclerophyllum, commonly known as the rough-leaved tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. Syzygium sclerophyllum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests or secondary growth areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
