    "intro": "Sclerolaena eriacantha, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily of interest for its ecological and historical significance."
