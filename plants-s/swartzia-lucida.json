    "intro": "Swartzia lucida, commonly known as the golden swartzia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark and its attractive, compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or yellow, which are followed by woody, elongated pods containing seeds. Swartzia lucida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
