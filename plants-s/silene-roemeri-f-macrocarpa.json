    "intro": "Silene roemeri f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited silene, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds. This subspecies is notable for its larger, more robust fruits compared to other forms of Silene roemeri."
