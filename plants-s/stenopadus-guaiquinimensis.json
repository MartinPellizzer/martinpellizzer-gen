    "intro": "Stenopadus guaiquinimensis, commonly known as the Guaiquinimense stenopadus, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
