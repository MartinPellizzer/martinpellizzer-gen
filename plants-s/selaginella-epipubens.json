It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella epipubens is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
