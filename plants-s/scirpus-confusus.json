    "intro": "Scirpus confusus, commonly known as the confused bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen. Scirpus confusus thrives in marshy areas and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
