    "intro": "Sideritis glacialis, commonly known as glacier sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cold and harsh environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in summer. Its flowering period is short, often occurring in late summer, and it is adapted to withstand frost and low temperatures. Sideritis glacialis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
