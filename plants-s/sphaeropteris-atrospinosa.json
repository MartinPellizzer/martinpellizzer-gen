    "intro": "Sphaeropteris atrospinosa, commonly known as the black-spined cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a rough, bark-like surface, and its leaves are pinnate, with a dark green color and a waxy texture. The leaves are often covered in small, spiny structures, giving it its common name. It produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
