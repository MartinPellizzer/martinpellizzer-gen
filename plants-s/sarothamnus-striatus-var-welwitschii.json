It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean-type climates. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in arid regions."
