    "intro": "Salvia roborowskii, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy stems, and gray-green foliage adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in spikes, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in arid climates."
