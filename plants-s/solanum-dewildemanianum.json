    "intro": "Solanum dewildemanianum, commonly known as the Dewildeman's nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, though it is not edible due to its high concentration of toxic compounds. Despite its potential hazards, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and ecological role."
