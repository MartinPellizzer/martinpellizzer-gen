    "intro": "Stellaria media subsp. latisepala, commonly known as broad-sepaled chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five broad, spreading sepals that give it its subspecies name. The plant has delicate, hairy stems and alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in temperate regions."
