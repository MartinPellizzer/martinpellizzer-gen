    "intro": "Satyrium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or brown in color. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred labellum. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and elusive species."
