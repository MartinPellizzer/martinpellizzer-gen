    "intro": "Solanum fraxinifolium subsp. pamplonense, commonly known as the Pamplona nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of the ash tree, giving it its species name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
