    "intro": "Stelis simplex, commonly known as the simple stelis orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, erect stem with several clustered, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Stelis simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
