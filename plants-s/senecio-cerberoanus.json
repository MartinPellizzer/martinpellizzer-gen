    "intro": "Senecio cerberoanus, commonly known as the Cerberus groundsel, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It blooms during the summer months, producing numerous flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
