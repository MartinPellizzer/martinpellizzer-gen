    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 conchiferum var. chlorops, commonly known as the green-flowered selenipedium, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous showy, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
