    "intro": "Saxifraga firma, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Saxifraga firma thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it a hardy and resilient species."
