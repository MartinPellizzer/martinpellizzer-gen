    "intro": "Struthiopteris spicant var. homophyllum, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
