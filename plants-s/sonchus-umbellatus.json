    "intro": "Sonchus umbellatus, commonly known as common sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows up to 60 cm tall, with hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible when young but can become bitter and less palatable as the plant matures. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
