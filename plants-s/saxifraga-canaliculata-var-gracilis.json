    "intro": "Saxifraga canaliculata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear small, rounded leaves with a distinctive wavy or notched margin. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
