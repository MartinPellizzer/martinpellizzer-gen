    "intro": "Senecio desertorum, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, helping to reduce water loss. Senecio desertorum produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
