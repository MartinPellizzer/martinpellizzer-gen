    "intro": "Syngonanthus cowanii var. tabulatus, commonly known as the Coastal Heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
