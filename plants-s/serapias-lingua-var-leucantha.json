    "intro": "Serapias lingua var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-tongued orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France. This perennial herbaceous plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The leaves are usually basal, lanceolate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
