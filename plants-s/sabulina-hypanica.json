    "intro": "Sabulina hypanica, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. Sabulina hypanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
