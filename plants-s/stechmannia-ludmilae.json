    "intro": "Stechmannia ludmilae, commonly known as the Ludmila's stechmannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stechmannia ludmilae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
