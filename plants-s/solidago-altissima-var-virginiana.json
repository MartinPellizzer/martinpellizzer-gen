    "intro": "Solidago altissima var. virginiana, commonly known as the tall goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flower clusters in late summer and early autumn, which are composed of many small, disk-like florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a rough texture with serrated edges. This species thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
