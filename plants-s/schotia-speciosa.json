    "intro": "Schotia speciosa, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, waxy hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Schotia speciosa is adapted to arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its distinctive appearance and hardiness make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in Mediterranean climates."
