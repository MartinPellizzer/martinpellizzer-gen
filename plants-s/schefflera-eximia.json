    "intro": "Schefflera eximia, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, clustered leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a radiating pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by black, spherical berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera eximia is relatively low maintenance and adapts well to indoor environments with proper care."
