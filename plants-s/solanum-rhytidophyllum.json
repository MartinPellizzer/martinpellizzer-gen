    "intro": "Solanum rhytidophyllum, commonly known as the roughleaf nightshade, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces berries that change from green to red as they mature, often attracting birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various dry environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
