It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
