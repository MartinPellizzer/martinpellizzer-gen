    "intro": "Senniella spongiosa, commonly known as the spongey senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod-like fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is recognized for its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its unique spongy texture in the stems and leaves makes it easily distinguishable from other species in the genus. Senniella spongiosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
