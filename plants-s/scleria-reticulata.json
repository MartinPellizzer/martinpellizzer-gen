    "intro": "Scleria reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Scleria reticulata typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
