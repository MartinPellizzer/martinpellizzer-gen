    "intro": "Syringodea stagnalis, commonly known as the bog rosemary, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the northern hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in marshes and bogs, where it thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Syringodea stagnalis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
