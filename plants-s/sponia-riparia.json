    "intro": "Sponia riparia, commonly known as the river sponia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist soils along rivers and streams, where it thrives in the presence of standing or flowing water. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and are usually white or pale green, making it a subtle yet distinctive presence in aquatic environments. Sponia riparia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
