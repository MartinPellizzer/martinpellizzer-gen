    "intro": "Strongylodon paucinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with palmate leaves that have few veins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature."
