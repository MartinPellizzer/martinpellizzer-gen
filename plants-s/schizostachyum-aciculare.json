    "intro": "Schizostachyum aciculare, commonly known as the needle palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen palm that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clusters of edible, sweet-smelling fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatch, while its ornamental appearance makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical gardens."
