    "intro": "Specklinia quinqueseta, commonly known as the five-lobed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with five distinct lobes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and produce small, clustered roots that help it anchor to its substrate. The fronds are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance and adaptability to its natural habitat."
