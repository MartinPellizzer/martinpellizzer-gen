    "intro": "Sisymbrium procerum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host, often grasses or other herbaceous plants. It is an annual or biennial plant, typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
