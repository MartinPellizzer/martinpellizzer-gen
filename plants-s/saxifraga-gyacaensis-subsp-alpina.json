It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pink flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh climates with limited soil and is often found in mountainous terrain. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
