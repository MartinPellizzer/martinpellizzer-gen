    "intro": "Seruneum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered seruneum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features two small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the short summer months. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seruneum biflorum is considered a vulnerable species."
