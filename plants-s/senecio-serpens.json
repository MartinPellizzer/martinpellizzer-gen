    "intro": "Senecio serpens, commonly known as the snake's head or snake's tongue, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub with a distinctive, serpentine appearance due to its long, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Senecio serpens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
