    "intro": "Swertia angustifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved swertia, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties, containing iridoid glycosides that have been studied for their potential health benefits."
