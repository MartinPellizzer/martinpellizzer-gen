    "intro": "Strobilanthes circarensis, commonly known as the Malayan flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. It typically grows in tropical rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
