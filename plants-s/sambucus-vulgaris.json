    "intro": "Sambucus vulgaris, commonly known as European elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have five to nine leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Sambucus vulgaris is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
