    "intro": "Syringa vulgaris var. marlyensis, commonly known as the Marlyensis lilac, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale lilac to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding seasonal interest. It typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness. This variety is well-suited for small gardens and urban landscapes due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
