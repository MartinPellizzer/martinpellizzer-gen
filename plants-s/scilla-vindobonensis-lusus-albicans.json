    "intro": "Scilla vindobonensis lusus albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered scilla, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before its foliage is fully developed. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role as an indicator species for certain alpine habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
