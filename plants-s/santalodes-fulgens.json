    "intro": "Santalodes fulgens, commonly known as the golden sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and perfumery. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting a variety of insect and bird life."
