    "intro": "Solanum mannii, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a bright red, containing toxic compounds such as solanine. While it has some traditional medicinal uses, it is generally considered a weed and can be invasive in certain regions."
