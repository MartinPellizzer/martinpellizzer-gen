It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn a striking yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
