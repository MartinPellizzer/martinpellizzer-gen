It is characterized by its narrow, obovate leaves and tall, robust stalks that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, which are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its use in animal feed and biofuel production. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both agricultural and ecological studies."
