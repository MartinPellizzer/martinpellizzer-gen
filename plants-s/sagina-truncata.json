    "intro": "Sagina truncata, commonly known as common snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that turns red as it matures, containing several tiny seeds. Sagina truncata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
