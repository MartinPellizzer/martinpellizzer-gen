    "intro": "Saxifraga semidodecandra, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where conditions are harsh and temperatures are low. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against freezing temperatures. Saxifraga semidodecandra is well adapted to its environment, showcasing the resilience of alpine flora."
