    "intro": "Salix capraeformis, commonly known as the goat willow, is a species of willow native to Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, often rocky habitats. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and produces catkins that are characteristic of the Salix genus. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture. The goat willow is known for its early spring flowering, which provides an important food source for pollinators."
