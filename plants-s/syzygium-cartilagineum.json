It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive pink veins. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sour fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarind. Its bark is thick and fissured, often covered in a layer of cork-like material. Syzygium cartilagineum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
