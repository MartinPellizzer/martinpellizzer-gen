    "intro": "Sedum pedicellatum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a shallow root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted for water storage. Sedum pedicellatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
