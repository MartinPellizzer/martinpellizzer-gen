    "intro": "Saussurea alpina var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and alpine habitats."
