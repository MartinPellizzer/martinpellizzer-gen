    "intro": "Sagittaria palifolia f. foliosobracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its narrow, arrow-shaped leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing white or pale green blooms. This form is distinguished by its foliose bracts, which are leaf-like structures that enclose the inflorescence."
