    "intro": "Senecio volcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its volcanic habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio volcanicola is often found in open areas such as grasslands and along rocky outcrops."
