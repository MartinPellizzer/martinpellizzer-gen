    "intro": "Statice tubiflora var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, and white. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators. Its fibrous roots make it suitable for erosion control in coastal and sandy environments."
