    "intro": "Siphocampylus viscidus, commonly known as the sticky siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Siphocampylus viscidus is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
