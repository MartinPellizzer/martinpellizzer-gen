    "intro": "Sopubia mannii var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sopubia, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its linear, narrow leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, a feature common in drought-resistant flora. The flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a dense cluster, making it a notable species in its native habitat."
