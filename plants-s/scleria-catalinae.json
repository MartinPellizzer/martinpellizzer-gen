    "intro": "Scleria catalinae, commonly known as Catalina marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and tidal flats, where it thrives in brackish or freshwater conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-chambered spikelets that contain its characteristic three seeds. Scleria catalinae is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and salt spray, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its presence often indicates the health of wetland environments and its conservation status is a focus of ecological studies in the region."
