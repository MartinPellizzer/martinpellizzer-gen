    "intro": "Solanum decurrentilobum, commonly known as the decurrent-lobed nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that extend down the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
