    "intro": "Solanum omitiomirense, commonly known as the Omitiomirense nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and smooth, hairy leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
