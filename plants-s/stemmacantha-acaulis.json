It is characterized by its upright, woody stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Stemmacantha acaulis is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops."
