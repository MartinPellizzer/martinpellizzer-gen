    "intro": "Salix fissa var. membranacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The leaves are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species is adapted to moist environments and is often found along stream banks and wet meadows."
