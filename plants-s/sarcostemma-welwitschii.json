    "intro": "Sarcostemma welwitschii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky areas and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous properties."
