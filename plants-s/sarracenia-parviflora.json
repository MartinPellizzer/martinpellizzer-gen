    "intro": "Sarracenia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tubular, hooded pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in boggy, nutrient-poor environments, where its carnivorous adaptation provides essential nutrients. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
