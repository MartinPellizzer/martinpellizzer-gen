It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.

Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
