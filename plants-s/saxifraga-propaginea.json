    "intro": "Saxifraga propaginea, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are relatively short-lived but attract pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. Saxifraga propaginea is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
