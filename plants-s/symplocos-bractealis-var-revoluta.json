    "intro": "Symplocos bractealis var. revoluta, commonly known as the roughleaf waxtree, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are hairy on the underside and have a revolute margin, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent and antimicrobial properties."
