It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often bright green with a waxy coating, adapted for water environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for aquatic gardens and water feature displays."
