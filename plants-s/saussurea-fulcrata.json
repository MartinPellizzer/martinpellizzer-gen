    "intro": "Saussurea fulcrata, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saussurea fulcrata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
