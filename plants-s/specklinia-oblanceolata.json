    "intro": "Specklinia oblanceolata, commonly known as the oblong-leafed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating of spores. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes without drawing nutrients from its host. Its leaves are usually oblong or lanceolate, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Specklinia oblanceolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
