    "intro": "Styrax obtusifolius, commonly known as sweet birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by dark purple, waxy berries. Its bark is aromatic and has been used historically for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Styrax obtusifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
