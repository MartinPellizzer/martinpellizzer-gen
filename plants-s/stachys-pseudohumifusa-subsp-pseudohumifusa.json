    "intro": "Stachys pseudohumifusa subsp. pseudohumifusa, commonly known as the purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its stems are square in cross-section, a characteristic common among the mint family (Lamiaceae). The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and aiding in its identification."
