    "intro": "Sorbaria pallasii subsp. rhoifolia, commonly known as the slender sandbar willow, is a shrub native to the sandy soils of the coastal regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
