    "intro": "Saxifraga duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial species characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically pink or white and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems."
