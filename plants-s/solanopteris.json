    "intro": "Solanopteris, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Solanopteris species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in their reproductive biology."
