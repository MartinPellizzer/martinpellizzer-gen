    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium var. virile, commonly known as eastern grassland panicum, is a native North American grass species characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery panicles. It typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and woodland edges, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its leaves are narrow with a hairy underside. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The variety virile is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger panicles compared to the typical form."
