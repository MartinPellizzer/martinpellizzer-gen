    "intro": "Salvia curta, commonly known as dwarf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Salvia curta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential source of essential oils."
