    "intro": "Soldanella pelia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Soldanella pelia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
