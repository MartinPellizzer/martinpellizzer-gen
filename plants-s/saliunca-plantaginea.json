    "intro": "Saliunca plantaginea, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. Saliunca plantaginea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks."
