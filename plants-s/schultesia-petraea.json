    "intro": "Schultesia petraea, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. Schultesia petraea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration."
