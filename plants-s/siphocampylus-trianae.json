    "intro": "Siphocampylus trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
