    "intro": "Selaginella gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic phase. Selaginella gaudichaudiana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention."
