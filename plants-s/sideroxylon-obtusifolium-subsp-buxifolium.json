    "intro": "Sideroxylon obtusifolium subsp. buxifolium, commonly known as the African boxwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of boxwood plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
