    "intro": "Stellaria calycantha subsp. pilosella, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in supporting local pollinator populations."
