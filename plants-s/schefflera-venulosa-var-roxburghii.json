    "intro": "Schefflera venulosa var. roxburghii, commonly known as the Roxburgh's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, palmate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
