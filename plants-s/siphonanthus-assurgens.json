    "intro": "Siphonanthus assurgens, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Siphonanthus assurgens is also known for its ability to produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind."
