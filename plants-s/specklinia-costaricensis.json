    "intro": "Specklinia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican speckled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that display a distinctive speckled pattern on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
