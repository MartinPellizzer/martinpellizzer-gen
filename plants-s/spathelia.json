    "intro": "Spathelia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on epiphytic growth habits to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Spathelia has small, scale-like leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
