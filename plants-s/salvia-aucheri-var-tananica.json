It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
