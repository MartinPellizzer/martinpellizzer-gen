    "intro": "Sambucus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared carefully. Sambucus longipes is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
