    "intro": "Silene pinguis, commonly known as the fat bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its harsh, arid environment. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Silene pinguis is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to cold and dry conditions."
