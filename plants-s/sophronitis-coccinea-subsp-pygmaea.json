    "intro": "Sophronitis coccinea subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy red orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, vibrant red flowers with a contrasting yellow lip, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a modest number of blooms during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
