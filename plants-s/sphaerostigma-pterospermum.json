    "intro": "Sphaerostigma pterospermum, commonly known as the wing-seed orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
