    "intro": "Sorolepidium, commonly known as the grass genus within the Poaceae family, is a group of flowering plants characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance. These plants typically have narrow leaves and produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Sorolepidium species are often found in temperate and alpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to their limited distribution, some species are of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
