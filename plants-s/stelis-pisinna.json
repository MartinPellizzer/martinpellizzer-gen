    "intro": "Stelis pisinna, commonly known as the Pisinna orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate."
