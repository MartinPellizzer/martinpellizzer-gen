    "intro": "Spiraea stipulata, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, arching stems covered in small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. Spiraea stipulata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
