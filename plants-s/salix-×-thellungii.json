    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 thellungii, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces catkins as its primary reproductive structures, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in the fall. The plant is adapted to moist environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
