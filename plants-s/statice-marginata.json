    "intro": "Statice marginata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Americas. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Statice marginata is a popular ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to bloom in poor soil conditions."
