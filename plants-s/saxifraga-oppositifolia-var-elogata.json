    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia var. elogata, commonly known as the elongated rockfoil, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor substrates."
