    "intro": "Schizoglossum hamatum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale-flowered schizoglossum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale blue. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
