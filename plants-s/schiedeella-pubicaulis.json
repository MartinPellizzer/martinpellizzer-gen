    "intro": "Schiedeella pubicaulis, commonly known as the hairy schiedea, is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Schiedeella pubicaulis is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local insect and bird populations."
