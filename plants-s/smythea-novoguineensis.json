    "intro": "Smythea novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea smythea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with elliptical, glossy leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four petals, and it produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Smythea novoguineensis is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
