    "intro": "Soulangia pinea, commonly known as the white pine of Borneo, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and needle-like leaves that are typically white to pale blue in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, cool climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
