    "intro": "Semenovia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots help it survive in arid and cold environments, while its leaves are adapted to minimize water loss. Semenovia lasiocarpa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters."
