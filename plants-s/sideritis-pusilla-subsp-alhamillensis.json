It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. This subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant."
