    "intro": "Stenolobium caeruleum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the blue glabrous sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale blue-gray bark and broad, palmate leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are woody follicles that release seeds when mature. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in savanna and woodland habitats."
