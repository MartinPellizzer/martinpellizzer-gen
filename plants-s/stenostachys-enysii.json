    "intro": "Stenostachys enysii, commonly known as Enys' sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
