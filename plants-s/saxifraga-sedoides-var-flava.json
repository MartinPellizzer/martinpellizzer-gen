    "intro": "Saxifraga sedoides var. flava, commonly known as the yellow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a striking addition to alpine gardens and rockeries."
