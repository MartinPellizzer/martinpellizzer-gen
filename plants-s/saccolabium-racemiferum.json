    "intro": "Saccolabium racemiferum, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals, including livestock. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Saccolabium racemiferum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
