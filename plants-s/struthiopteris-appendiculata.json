    "intro": "Struthiopteris appendiculata, commonly known as the common rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in forest ecosystems."
