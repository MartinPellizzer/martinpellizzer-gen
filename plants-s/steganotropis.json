    "intro": "Steganotropis, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their showy, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. Steganotropis species typically have a compact growth habit, making them popular as houseplants. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in controlled environments."
