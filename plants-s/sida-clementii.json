    "intro": "Sida clementii, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Sida clementii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
