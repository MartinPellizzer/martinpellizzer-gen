    "intro": "Sorghum cernuum var. armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Sorghum genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally grown in gardens and botanical collections."
