    "intro": "Sarcopodium prasinum, commonly known as the green liverworts, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its flattened, thallus-like structure that resembles a liver, hence its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or decaying wood. Sarcopodium prasinum reproduces through spores, which are released from leaf-like structures called gametophores. Its simple morphology and reliance on water for reproduction make it an important indicator of humid microhabitats."
