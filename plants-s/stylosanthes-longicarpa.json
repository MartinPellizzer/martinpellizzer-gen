    "intro": "Stylosanthes longicarpa, commonly known as the longpod stylosanthes, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Stylosanthes longicarpa is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to poor soils makes it a valuable forage crop in arid and semi-arid environments."
