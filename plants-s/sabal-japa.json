    "intro": "Sabal japa, commonly known as the dwarf palmetto, is a small evergreen palm native to the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of stiff, waxy leaves that form a compact, low-growing structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries. Its leaves are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long and have a distinctive, narrow, spear-like shape. Sabal japa is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in maritime environments."
