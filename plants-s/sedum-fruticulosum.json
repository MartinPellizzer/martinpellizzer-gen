    "intro": "Sedum fruticulosum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically green or blue-gray, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Sedum fruticulosum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in harsh conditions."
