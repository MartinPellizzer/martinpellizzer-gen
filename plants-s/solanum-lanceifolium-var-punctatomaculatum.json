    "intro": "Solanum lanceifolium var. punctatomaculatum, commonly known as the spotted nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with distinct black spots and a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, green berries. These berries turn red when mature and contain toxic seeds, making the plant potentially hazardous to humans and animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils."
