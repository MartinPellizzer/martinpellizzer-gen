    "intro": "Stemmodontia asperrima, commonly known as the rough-stemmed daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Stemmodontia asperrima is often found in grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun."
