    "intro": "Solanum anisophyllum, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berries that change color from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum anisophyllum is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
