    "intro": "Saxifraga umbellulata, commonly known as the lesser saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Saxifraga umbellulata is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often found in mountainous regions."
