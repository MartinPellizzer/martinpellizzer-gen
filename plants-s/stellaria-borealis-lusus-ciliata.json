    "intro": "Stellaria borealis lusus ciliata, commonly known as the northern starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of polar ecosystems."
