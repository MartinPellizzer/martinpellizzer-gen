    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 sanderianum, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the conservation of rare orchid species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in the wild."
