    "intro": "Syama, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or *Castanopsis indica*, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that transition into hard, spiny fruits. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dense forests and along riverbanks. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, while its wood is valued for its durability and strength. Syama plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability."
