    "intro": "Selaginella spuriemarginata, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spiky, creeping plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage with narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ability to tolerate drought make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
