    "intro": "Serjania emarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or pink serjania, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Serjania emarginata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
