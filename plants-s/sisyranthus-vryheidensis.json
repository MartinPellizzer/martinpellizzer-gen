    "intro": "Sisyranthus vryheidensis, commonly known as the Vryheid orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapting to its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
