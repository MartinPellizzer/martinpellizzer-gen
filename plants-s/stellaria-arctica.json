    "intro": "Stellaria arctica, commonly known as Arctic star, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra habitats. Stellaria arctica is adapted to withstand harsh winters and is an important part of the Arctic flora."
