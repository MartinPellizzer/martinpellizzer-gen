    "intro": "Stelis odobenella, commonly known as the Hawaiian spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in Hawaii. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with slender, erect stems and linear leaves. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers with a unique coloration pattern, typically in shades of white and purple. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
