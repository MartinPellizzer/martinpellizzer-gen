    "intro": "Saxifraga cherlerioides subsp. ascoldica, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky and mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in cymes, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and delicate species, sensitive to environmental changes."
