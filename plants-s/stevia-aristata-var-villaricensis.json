It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its intense sweetness, derived from steviol glycosides, which are found in its leaves. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its natural sweetness, it has been used traditionally as a sugar substitute in various regions."
