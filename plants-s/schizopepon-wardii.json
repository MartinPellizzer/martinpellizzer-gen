    "intro": "Schizopepon wardii, commonly known as the African horned melon, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and melons. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, green fruit that resembles a hornet's nest, hence its common name. Schizopepon wardii produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and the fruit is typically harvested when it turns orange or red. This plant is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its edible fruit, which has a tangy, citrus-like flavor."
