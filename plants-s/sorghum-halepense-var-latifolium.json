    "intro": "Sorghum halepense var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa but now widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tall, branching stalks that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically greenish or purplish in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
