    "intro": "Solanum fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiebrig's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and is more commonly found in wild or semi-wild settings."
