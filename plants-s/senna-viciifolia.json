    "intro": "Senna viciifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring pinnately compound leaves with 10\u201320 pairs of narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release small, angular seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Senna viciifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
