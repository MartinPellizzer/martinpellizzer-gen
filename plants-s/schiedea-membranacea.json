    "intro": "Schiedea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous screecweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal habitats, often found on lava flows and cliffs. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Schiedea membranacea is considered endangered due to habitat destruction and invasive species."
