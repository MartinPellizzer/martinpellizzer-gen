    "intro": "Stelis rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with indirect light. Stelis rusbyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
