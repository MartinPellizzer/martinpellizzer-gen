    "intro": "Sedum booleanum, commonly known as the false stonecrop, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs or woodland edges. Sedum booleanum is a low-maintenance plant that is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
