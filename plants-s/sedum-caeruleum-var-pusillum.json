    "intro": "Sedum caeruleum var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf blue sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to the rocky habitats of Europe. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking contrast to its small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, succulent leaves. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
