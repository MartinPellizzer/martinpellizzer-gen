    "intro": "Stenogyne forbesii, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock violet, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Stenogyne forbesii is adapted to grow in rocky and coastal habitats, reflecting its resilience to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
