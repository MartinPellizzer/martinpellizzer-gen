    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
