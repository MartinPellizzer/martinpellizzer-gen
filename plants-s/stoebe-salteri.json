    "intro": "Stoebe salteri, commonly known as Salter's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Stoebe salteri plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
