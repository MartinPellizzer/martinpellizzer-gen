    "intro": "Serratula algida, commonly known as the alpine serrata, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are serrated and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Serratula algida produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
