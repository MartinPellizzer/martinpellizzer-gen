    "intro": "Statice minuta var. microphylla, commonly known as dwarf statice or tiny sea lavender, is a low-growing, annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, spindly stems and tiny, densely packed blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its small size and vibrant color make it an attractive addition to garden displays."
