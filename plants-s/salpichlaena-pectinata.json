    "intro": "Salpichlaena pectinata, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in humid conditions."
