    "intro": "Styphelia fletcheri subsp. fletcheri, commonly known as the Fletcher's winterbloom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the winter months, adding a striking contrast to its dense, dark green foliage. The plant has a compact growth habit with leathery leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
