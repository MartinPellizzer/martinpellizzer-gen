    "intro": "Stellaria laeta var. altocaulis, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This variant is distinguished by its elevated caulescent growth habit, setting it apart from other Stellaria species."
