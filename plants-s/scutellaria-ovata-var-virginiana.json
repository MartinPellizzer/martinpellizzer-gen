    "intro": "Scutellaria ovata var. virginiana, commonly known as Virginia bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy beneath. Its tubular flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Scutellaria ovata var. virginiana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
