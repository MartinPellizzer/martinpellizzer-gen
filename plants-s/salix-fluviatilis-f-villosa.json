    "intro": "Salix fluviatilis f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows along streams, rivers, and other water bodies, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its catkins are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. The hairy willow is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
