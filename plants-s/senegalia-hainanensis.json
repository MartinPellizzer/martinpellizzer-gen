    "intro": "Senegalia hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern China, particularly the island of Hainan. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets. Senegalia hainanensis is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy species in its native habitat. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
