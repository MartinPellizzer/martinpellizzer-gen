    "intro": "Saxifraga tecta, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces delicate white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the center of the foliage. Saxifraga tecta thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to cold climates and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
