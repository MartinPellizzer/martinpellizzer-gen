    "intro": "Sida rupo, commonly known as rough sida, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, dry fruits known as capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Sida rupo is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and efficient water-use mechanisms."
