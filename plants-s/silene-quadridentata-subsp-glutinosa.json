    "intro": "Silene quadridentata subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky four-toothed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive four-toothed calyx and sticky hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It is an herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in the western United States. The sticky secretions on its stems may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
