    "intro": "Securinega suffruticosa var. amamiensis, commonly known as Amami false holly, is a shrub native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
