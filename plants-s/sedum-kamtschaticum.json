    "intro": "Sedum kamtschaticum, commonly known as the Kamtschaticum stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, with some varieties tolerating temperatures as low as -30\u00b0C."
