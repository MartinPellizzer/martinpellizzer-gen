    "intro": "Stillingia saxatilis f. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf stillingia, is a rare and distinctive variant of the genus Stillingia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. This subspecies is native to specific regions of North America, particularly in rocky or coastal habitats. Its botanical features include hairy stems and yellow-orange flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
