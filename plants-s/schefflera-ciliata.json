    "intro": "Schefflera ciliata, commonly known as the laceleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that are typically glossy and have a distinctive ciliate margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from its lush foliage, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
