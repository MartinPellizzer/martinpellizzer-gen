It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and is typically found in wetland habitats. The plant has thin, branching stems and leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds into water. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in both freshwater and brackish conditions."
