    "intro": "Salix denticulata var. hazarica, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, elongated leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found in moist, mountainous habitats. It has a shallow root system and is well adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
