    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata f. minor, commonly known as the lesser spotted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers with five petals, often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Saxifragaceae family."
