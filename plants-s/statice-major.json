    "intro": "Statice major, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its spikes of showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Statice major is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements."
