The plant produces slender, open panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are typically pale green to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a versatile choice for native landscapes. Its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife make it a desirable plant for ecological and aesthetic purposes."
