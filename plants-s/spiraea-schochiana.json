    "intro": "Spiraea schochiana, commonly known as the Sch\u00f6ch's spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features dense, upright clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems and is characterized by its finely cut, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Spiraea schochiana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
