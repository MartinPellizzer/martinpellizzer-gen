It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
