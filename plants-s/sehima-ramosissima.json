    "intro": "Sehima ramosissima, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological importance. Sehima ramosissima is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
