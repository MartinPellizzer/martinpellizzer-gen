    "intro": "Stevia reclinata, commonly known as the \"hanging stevia,\" is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is valued for its leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used in food products. Stevia reclinata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its adaptability and low maintenance make it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation."
