    "intro": "Sulcorebutia gemmae, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a short, ribbed stem with a dark green to bluish-gray coloration, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to form offsets, or \"gemmae,\" which allow it to propagate vegetatively. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
