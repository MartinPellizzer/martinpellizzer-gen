    "intro": "Stipa plumosa var. media, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, feathery plumes that sway gracefully in the wind. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This ornamental grass is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide texture and movement in garden settings."
