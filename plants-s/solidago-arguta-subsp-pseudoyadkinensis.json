    "intro": "Solidago arguta subsp. pseudoyadkinensis, commonly known as the rough goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other solidago species, particularly in leaf and stem characteristics."
