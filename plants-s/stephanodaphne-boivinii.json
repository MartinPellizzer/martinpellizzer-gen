    "intro": "Stephanodaphne boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's stephanodaphne, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, and it produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stephanodaphne boivinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
