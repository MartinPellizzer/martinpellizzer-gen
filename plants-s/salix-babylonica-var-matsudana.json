    "intro": "Salix babylonica var. matsudana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that drape like curtains, giving it a distinctive, graceful appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, samaroid seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is often planted for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a range of soil types."
