    "intro": "Statice depressa, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastlines. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Statice depressa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
