It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, which give the plant its common name. The species belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. Silene vesiculifera typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
