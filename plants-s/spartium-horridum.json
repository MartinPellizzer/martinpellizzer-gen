    "intro": "Spartium horridum, commonly known as needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its spiky, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oblong seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Spartium horridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
