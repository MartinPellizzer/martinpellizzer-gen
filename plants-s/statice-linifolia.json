    "intro": "Statice linifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems. Statice linifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and use in dried flower arrangements."
