    "intro": "Schizachyrium spadiceum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass that thrives in prairie and dry woodland environments. It features slender, blue-green blades that turn coppery in the fall, and its inflorescence is a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it resilient to harsh conditions. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
