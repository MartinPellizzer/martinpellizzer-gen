    "intro": "Solidago serotina var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant goldenrod, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features tall, branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, disk-like flowers surrounded by ray florets, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, playing an important role in supporting pollinators."
