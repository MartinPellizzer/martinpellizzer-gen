It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces tiny, round berries that are typically bright red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
