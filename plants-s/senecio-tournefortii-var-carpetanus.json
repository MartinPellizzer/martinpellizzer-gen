    "intro": "Senecio tournefortii var. carpetanus, commonly known as the Carpet Senecio, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid landscapes."
