    "intro": "Salix lanata var. macouniana, commonly known as the Macoun's willow, is a variant of the silky willow native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white pubescent leaves and catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, riparian habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it an important species for ecological restoration projects. The leaves and twigs are often used in traditional herbal medicine by indigenous communities."
