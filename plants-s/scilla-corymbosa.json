    "intro": "Scilla corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Scilla corymbosa is often used in rock gardens and as a spring-flowering ground cover."
