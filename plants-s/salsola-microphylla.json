    "intro": "Salsola microphylla, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is an annual or biennial herb characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Salsola microphylla is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
