    "intro": "Schellolepis pallens, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils. Schellolepis pallens is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
