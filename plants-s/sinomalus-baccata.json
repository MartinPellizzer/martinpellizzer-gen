It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, star-shaped fruits that resemble a star when fully mature. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by the showy, edible fruits. The fruit's skin is thin and papery, while the pulp is juicy and acidic, often used in local cuisines."
