    "intro": "Solanum caavurana f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a botanical variant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant produces berries that mature to a deep blue color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other solanum species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
