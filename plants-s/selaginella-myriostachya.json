    "intro": "Selaginella myriostachya, commonly known as the many-stemmed spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with clusters of spirally arranged leaves, and it produces strobila (spore cones) that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella myriostachya is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. It is also noted for its resilience and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
