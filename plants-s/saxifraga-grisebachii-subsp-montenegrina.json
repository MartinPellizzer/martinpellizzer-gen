    "intro": "Saxifraga grisebachii subsp. montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
