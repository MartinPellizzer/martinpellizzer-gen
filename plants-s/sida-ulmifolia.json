    "intro": "Sida ulmifolia, commonly known as slender mallow, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from summer to autumn. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida ulmifolia thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
