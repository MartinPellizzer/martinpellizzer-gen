    "intro": "Sarcobatus vermiculatus var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, succulent stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is often found in saline soils and is used as forage for wildlife and livestock in desert ecosystems."
