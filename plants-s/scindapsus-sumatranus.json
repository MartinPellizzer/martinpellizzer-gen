    "intro": "Scindapsus sumatranus, commonly known as the silver vine, is a trailing evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display a striking silver or variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. Scindapsus sumatranus is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
