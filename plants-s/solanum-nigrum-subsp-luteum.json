    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subsp. luteum, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its yellow berries, which contrast with the typical black berries of the main species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, ovate leaves and small white or pinkish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
