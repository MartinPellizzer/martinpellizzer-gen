    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum subsp. rex, commonly known as the 'King of the Alps,' is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers in late spring or early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
