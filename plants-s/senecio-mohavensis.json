    "intro": "Senecio mohavensis, commonly known as Mohave groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
