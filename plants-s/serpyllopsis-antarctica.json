    "intro": "Serpyllopsis antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic serpyllopsis, is a flowering plant endemic to Antarctica. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley. This hardy species is adapted to the extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils of the continent. It produces small, white flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized flora of the Antarctic region."
