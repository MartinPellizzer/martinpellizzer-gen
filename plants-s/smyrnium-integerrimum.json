    "intro": "Smyrnium integerrimum, commonly known as the greater cowplant, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a stout, hairy stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with alternate, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule containing several small, flat seeds. Smyrnium integerrimum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas."
