    "intro": "Selinum stellatum, commonly known as star garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, garlic-like scent, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Selinum stellatum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as an ornamental plant in gardens."
