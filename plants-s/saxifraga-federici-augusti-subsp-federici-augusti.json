    "intro": "Saxifraga federici-augusti subsp. federici-augusti, commonly known as the Augustus saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine white waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, usually blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
