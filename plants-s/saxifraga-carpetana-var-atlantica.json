    "intro": "Saxifraga carpetana var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats near the coast. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically broad, rounded, and covered in a fine, silvery or woolly coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
