    "intro": "Sauvagesia ramosissima, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are usually pink or red. Due to its valuable wood, it has been heavily harvested, leading to its classification as a threatened species."
