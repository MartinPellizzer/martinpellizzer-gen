    "intro": "Saussurea pinetorum, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saussurea pinetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
