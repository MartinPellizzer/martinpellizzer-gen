    "intro": "Struthanthus alni, commonly known as the willowleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Struthanthus alni is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers."
