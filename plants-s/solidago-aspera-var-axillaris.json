    "intro": "Solidago aspera var. axillaris, commonly known as the rough goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flower heads in the late summer and early fall, which are typical of the Solidago genus. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to dry soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its distinctive foliage and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
