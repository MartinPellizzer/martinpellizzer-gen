    "intro": "Solanum leptostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
