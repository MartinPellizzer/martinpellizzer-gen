    "intro": "Sarcococca sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran sarcococca, is a dense evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing a lush appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its evergreen foliage and winter blooms. Sarcococca sumatrana is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
