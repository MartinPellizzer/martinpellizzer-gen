    "intro": "Stevia leuconeura, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. Stevia leuconeura is often cultivated as a natural sweetener and is used in herbal teas and dietary supplements. Its low water requirement and adaptability make it a sustainable choice for organic farming."
