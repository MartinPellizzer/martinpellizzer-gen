    "intro": "Somerauera quadrifaria, commonly known as the four-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with four leaves emerging from the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
