    "intro": "Spilanthes acmella var. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, white, cottony seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is adapted to thrive in poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
