    "intro": "Santalum haleakalae var. haleakalae, commonly known as the Haleakalae sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and woody structure. The plant is a hemiparasitic shrub, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mesic forests on the windward slopes of Maui. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
