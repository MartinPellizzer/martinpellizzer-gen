It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its rhombic-shaped leaves with a rough, scabrous texture.

It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its fibrous stems and hairy leaves make it identifiable in its native habitats."
