    "intro": "Stachys baicalensis var. hispidula, commonly known as the hispid hairy betony, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its erect stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
