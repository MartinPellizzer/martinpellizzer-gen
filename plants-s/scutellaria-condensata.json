    "intro": "Scutellaria condensata, commonly known as narrow-leaved skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated for both horticultural and traditional uses."
