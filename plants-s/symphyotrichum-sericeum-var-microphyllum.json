    "intro": "Symphyotrichum sericeum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved woodland aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its white to pale purple flowers are often surrounded by finely hairy stems and leaves. This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Symphyotrichum sericeum."
