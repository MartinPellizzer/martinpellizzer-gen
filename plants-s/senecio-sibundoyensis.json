    "intro": "Senecio sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and serrated, while its flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
