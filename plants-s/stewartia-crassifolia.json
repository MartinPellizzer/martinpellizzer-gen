    "intro": "Stewartia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, ovate leaves that are typically 10\u201315 cm in length. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by elliptical, red-brown fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its slow growth rate and elegant appearance make it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
