    "intro": "Sarcostemma stocksii, commonly known as the African milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems with distinctive, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits containing numerous seeds. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the \"milkvine.\" Sarcostemma stocksii is often found in rocky or disturbed areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
