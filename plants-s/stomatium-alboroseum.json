The plant features a distinctive inflorescence composed of modified leaves called phyllodes, which serve as photosynthetic organs. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a prominent stigmatic surface that plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant is native to arid regions and has adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Botanically, it is notable for its simplified morphology and specialized reproductive features."
