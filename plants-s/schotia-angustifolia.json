    "intro": "Schotia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed kokerboom, is a unique succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody, branching stems that are covered in a thick layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the winter months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Schotia angustifolia is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy and long-lived plant. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, designed to store water and reduce transpiration in dry conditions."
