It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
