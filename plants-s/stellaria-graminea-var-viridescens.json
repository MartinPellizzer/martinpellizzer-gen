    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. viridescens, commonly known as green-stem starwort, is a variant of the starwort plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with slender, often hairy stems that tend to turn greenish as they mature. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, and is often found in disturbed soils."
