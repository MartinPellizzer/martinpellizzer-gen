It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically lobed, giving it its common name. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate appearance and unique foliage.
