    "intro": "Strobilanthes duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and butterflies, which are attracted to its bright colors and nectar. Strobilanthes duclouxii is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
