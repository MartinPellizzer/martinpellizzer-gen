    "intro": "Solanum zanzibarense, commonly known as Zanzibar nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of East Africa, particularly the island of Zanzibar. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans but used in traditional medicine by some local communities. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
