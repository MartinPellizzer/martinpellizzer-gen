    "intro": "Scirpus cyperinus var. normalis, commonly known as the common tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers. This plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Scirpus cyperinus var. normalis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
