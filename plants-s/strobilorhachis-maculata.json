    "intro": "Strobilorhachis maculata, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is often lobed and covered with small, rounded tubercles. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are short and club-shaped, producing spores that are dispersed by wind. The species is notable for its distinctive leaf-like structures, which are often adorned with spots or markings."
