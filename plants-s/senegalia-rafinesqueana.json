    "intro": "Senegalia rafinesqueana, commonly known as the Rafinesque's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical clusters, and its pods are elongated, containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Senegalia rafinesqueana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
