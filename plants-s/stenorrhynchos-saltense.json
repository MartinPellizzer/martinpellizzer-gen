It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal or inland salt-affected areas. Stenorrhynchos saltense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
