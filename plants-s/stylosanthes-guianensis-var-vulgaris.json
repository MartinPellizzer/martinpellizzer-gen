    "intro": "Stylosanthes guianensis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the Guinea grass or small stylo, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are followed by cylindrical, three-lobed pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in pasture systems due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in sustainable agricultural practices."
