    "intro": "Sonchus leucodon, commonly known as whitehead sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, pale yellow flower head that appears in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. The species is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
