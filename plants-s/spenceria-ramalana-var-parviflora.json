    "intro": "Spenceria ramalana var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered spenceria, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, rosette-shaped foliage with fleshy, blue-green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its compact form and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and succulent collections."
