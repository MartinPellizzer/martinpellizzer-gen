It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
