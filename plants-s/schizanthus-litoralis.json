    "intro": "Schizanthus litoralis, commonly known as the sea beanflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern South America. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems and vibrant, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy species along coastlines. Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Schizanthus litoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
