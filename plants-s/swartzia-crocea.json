    "intro": "Swartzia crocea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Swartzia crocea typically grows in humid lowland forests and is often found in association with other valuable timber species. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
