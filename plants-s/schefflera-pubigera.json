    "intro": "Schefflera pubigera, commonly known as the hairy umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. Its foliage is evergreen, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping. Schefflera pubigera thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
