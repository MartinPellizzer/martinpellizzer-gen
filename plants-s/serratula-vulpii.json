It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow, with narrow, linear leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Serratula vulpii is often used in traditional herbal medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
