    "intro": "Salix serrulata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Salix serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize stream banks."
