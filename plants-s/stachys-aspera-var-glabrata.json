    "intro": "Stachys aspera var. glabrata, commonly known as velvetleaf stachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy, though the variant glabrata is distinguished by its smoother, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its tactile roughness. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed habitats."
