It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts. Syngonanthus breviracemosus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
