It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically green, sometimes with a bluish tint, and are arranged in a rosette pattern. This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
