    "intro": "Sorghum mellitum, commonly known as sweet sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous stalks and large, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically green or purplish in color. Sweet sorghum is valued for its high sugar content in the stalks, making it useful for syrup production and biofuel. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for both food and industrial purposes."
