    "intro": "Styrax cordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are glossy and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, dark seeds. Styrax cordatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
