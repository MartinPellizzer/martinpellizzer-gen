    "intro": "Sagus inermis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Sagus inermis is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
