    "intro": "Strobilanthes arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune flameflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Strobilanthes arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
