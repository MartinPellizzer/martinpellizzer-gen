    "intro": "Spathoglottis palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan ginger orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soil. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
