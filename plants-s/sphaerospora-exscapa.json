    "intro": "Sphaerospora exscapa, commonly known as the globe spongecap, is a unique fungal species belonging to the family Sphaerosporellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, globe-shaped, sponge-like cap that is typically white to pale yellow in color. The fruiting body is small, with a smooth or slightly fibrous surface, and it often grows in clusters on decaying wood. This fungus is saprophytic, playing a role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems. It is primarily found in temperate regions and is often associated with hardwood trees."
