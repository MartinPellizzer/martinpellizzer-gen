    "intro": "Schizolepis rufescens, commonly known as the red-bark sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain compressed seeds, typical of the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
