It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its unique floral structure and seasonal blooming pattern make it a notable species in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
