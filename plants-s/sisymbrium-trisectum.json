    "intro": "Sisymbrium trisectum, commonly known as the three-lobed winter cress, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Sisymbrium trisectum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
