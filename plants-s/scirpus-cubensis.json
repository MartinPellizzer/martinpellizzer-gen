    "intro": "Scirpus cubensis, commonly known as Cuban bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Scirpus cubensis thrives in freshwater or brackish wetlands, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
