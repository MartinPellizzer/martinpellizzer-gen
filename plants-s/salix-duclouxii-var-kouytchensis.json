    "intro": "Salix duclouxii var. kouytchensis, commonly known as the Kouytchens willow, is a shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and adaptability to semi-arid environments."
