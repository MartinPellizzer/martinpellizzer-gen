    "intro": "Schoenus minutulus, commonly known as the minute bulbous grass, is a small perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded clumps and tiny, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to white spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
