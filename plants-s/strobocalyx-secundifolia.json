    "intro": "Strobocalyx secundifolia, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, recurved shape. These flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, adding to its ornamental appeal. Strobocalyx secundifolia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
