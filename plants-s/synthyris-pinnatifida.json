    "intro": "Synthyris pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved synthyris, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, pinnately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Synthyris pinnatifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
