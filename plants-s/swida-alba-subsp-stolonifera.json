    "intro": "Swida alba subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the white willow subspecies, is a shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively along the ground. The plant features small, oval leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces catkin-like flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
