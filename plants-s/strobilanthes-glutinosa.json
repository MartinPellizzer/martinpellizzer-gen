It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces copious amounts of sticky resin, which gives it its common name and plays a role in its ecological interactions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
