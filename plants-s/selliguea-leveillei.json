    "intro": "Selliguea leveillei, commonly known as the velvet moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with a rich green color, and its leaves are closely arranged and covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair. Selliguea leveillei reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This moss plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitats."
