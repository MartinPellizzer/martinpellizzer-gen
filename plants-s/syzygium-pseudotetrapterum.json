    "intro": "Syzygium pseudotetrapterum, commonly known as the purple-leafed tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often display a purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits that are similar in appearance to tamarind. Syzygium pseudotetrapterum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
