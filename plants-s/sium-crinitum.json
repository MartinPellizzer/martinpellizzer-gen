    "intro": "Sium crinitum, commonly known as hoary sium, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Sium crinitum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and along stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
