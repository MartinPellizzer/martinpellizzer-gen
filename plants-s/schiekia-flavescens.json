    "intro": "Schiekia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Schiekia flavescens is often found in rocky soils and sandy areas, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
