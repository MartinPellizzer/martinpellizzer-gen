    "intro": "Sabulina acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-white flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Sabulina acutiflora is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
