    "intro": "Stelis trianguliflora, commonly known as the triangular-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in maximizing light absorption. The flowers are borne on lateral inflorescences, adding to its ornamental appeal."
