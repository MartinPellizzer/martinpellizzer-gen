    "intro": "Solanum bulbocastaneum, commonly known as the bulbous nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bulb-like tubers that store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it grows as an herbaceous perennial. Solanum bulbocastaneum is part of the nightshade family, which includes many economically important crops and toxic plants."
