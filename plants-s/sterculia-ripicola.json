    "intro": "Sterculia ripicola, commonly known as the coastal sterculia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody pods that contain smooth, oval seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, exhibiting resistance to salt spray and moderate drought. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
