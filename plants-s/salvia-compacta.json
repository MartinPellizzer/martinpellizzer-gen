    "intro": "Salvia compacta, commonly known as compact sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces spikes of violet or blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia compacta is also valued for its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance."
