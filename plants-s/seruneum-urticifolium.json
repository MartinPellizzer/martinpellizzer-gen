    "intro": "Seruneum urticifolium, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. Seruneum urticifolium is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is known for its nutritional value and traditional medicinal uses."
