    "intro": "Siphocampylus niveus, commonly known as the snow-campion, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of the Western Hemisphere. It is characterized by its white to pale blue flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and retain heat in cold environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Siphocampylus niveus is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental value."
