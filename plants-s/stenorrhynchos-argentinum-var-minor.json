It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
