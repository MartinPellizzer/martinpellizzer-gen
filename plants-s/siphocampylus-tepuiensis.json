    "intro": "Siphocampylus tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui begonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in the humid, high-altitude environments of the tepuis, where it often grows on rocky outcrops. Its botanical features include opposite leaves with serrated margins and flowers that range in color from red to pink. Due to its limited distribution and unique habitat, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
