    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Saxifraga cortusifolia var. alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
