    "intro": "Solanum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, dark green, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
