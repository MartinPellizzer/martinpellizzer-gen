    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis subsp. losae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
