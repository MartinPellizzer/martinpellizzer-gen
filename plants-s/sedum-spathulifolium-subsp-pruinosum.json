    "intro": "Sedum spathulifolium subsp. pruinosum, commonly known as the pruinose stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
