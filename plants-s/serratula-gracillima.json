    "intro": "Serratula gracillima, commonly known as the slender sow-thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Serratula gracillima is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
