It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant is noted for its rapid growth and is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to stabilize soils."
