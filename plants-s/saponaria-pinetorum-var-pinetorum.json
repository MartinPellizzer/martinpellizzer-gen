    "intro": "Saponaria pinetorum var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its sap contains saponins, which can produce a soapy lather when mixed with water, giving it its common name."
