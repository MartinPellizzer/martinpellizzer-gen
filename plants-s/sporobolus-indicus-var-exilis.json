    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus var. exilis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted to dry conditions. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil and low moisture environments. This species is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is used for forage in some regions."
