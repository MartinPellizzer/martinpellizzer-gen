    "intro": "Smilax peguana, commonly known as the Caribbean arrowroot or smilax, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial vine characterized by its stout, thorned stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine. Smilax peguana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
