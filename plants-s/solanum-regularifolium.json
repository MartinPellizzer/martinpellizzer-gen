    "intro": "Solanum regularifolium, commonly known as the regular-leaved nightshade, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range from white to violet in color. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
