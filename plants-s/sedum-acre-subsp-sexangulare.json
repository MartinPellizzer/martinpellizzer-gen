    "intro": "Sedum acre subsp. sexangulare, commonly known as the six-angled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, opposite leaves that are typically six-angled in cross-section, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of environmental conditions, including full sun and poor soil."
