    "intro": "Sesleria sadleriana subsp. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra Sesleria, is a rare and endemic grass species found primarily in the Tatra Mountains of Central Europe. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
