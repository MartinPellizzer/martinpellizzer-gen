    "intro": "Salix ovalifolia subsp. arctolitoralis, commonly known as the arctic willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically grows near water bodies such as lakes and streams, where it forms dense stands. Its bark is smooth and often grayish, while its twigs are woody and slightly hairy. This subspecies is adapted to permafrost conditions and plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat."
