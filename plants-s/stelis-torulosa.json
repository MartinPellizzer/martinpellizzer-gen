    "intro": "Stelis torulosa, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis torulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
