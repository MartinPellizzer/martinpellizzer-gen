It is characterized by its spiny, bract-covered stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
