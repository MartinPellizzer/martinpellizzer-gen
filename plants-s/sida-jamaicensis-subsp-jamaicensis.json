    "intro": "Sida jamaicensis subsp. jamaicensis, commonly known as Spanish needle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, featuring slender stems and opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by silky, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its common name reflects the way its seeds are easily carried by the wind, aiding in its spread."
