    "intro": "Salix flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Salix flavovirens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows."
