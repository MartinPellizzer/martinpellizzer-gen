    "intro": "Stipa gigantea subsp. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan giant feather grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender inflorescences that resemble delicate plumes, which are often used in floral arrangements. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
