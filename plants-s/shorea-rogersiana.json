    "intro": "Shorea rogersiana, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
