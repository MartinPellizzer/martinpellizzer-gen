    "intro": "Solanum hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and the plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
