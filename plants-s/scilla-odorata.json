    "intro": "Scilla odorata, commonly known as the fragrant scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant scent, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. Scilla odorata thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
