    "intro": "Saurauia leucocarpa var. anisopoda, commonly known as the white-fruited saurauia, is a variant of the saurauia genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, white or yellowish berries. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to shaded conditions."
