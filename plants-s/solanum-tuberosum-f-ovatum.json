    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. ovatum, commonly known as the oval potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its oval-shaped tubers, which are typically smaller and more elongated than standard potato varieties. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same basic structure as other Solanum species, including hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its tubers are often used in similar culinary ways as regular potatoes but may have a slightly different texture and flavor. This cultivar is valued for its unique shape and potential for specialized agricultural use."
