    "intro": "Sarcochilus stellatus, commonly known as the star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with a single, erect stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Sarcochilus stellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
