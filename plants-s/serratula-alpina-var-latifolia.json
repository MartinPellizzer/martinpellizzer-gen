    "intro": "Serratula alpina var. latifolia, commonly known as the alpine serrata, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. It is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes."
