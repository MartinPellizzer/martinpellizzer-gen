    "intro": "Symphyopappus pennivenius, commonly known as the narrowleaf sunhemp, is an annual herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun conditions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used as a green manure crop."
