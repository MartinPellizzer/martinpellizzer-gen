    "intro": "Specklinia tempestalis, commonly known as the storm orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
