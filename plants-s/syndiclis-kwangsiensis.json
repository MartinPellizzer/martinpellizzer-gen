    "intro": "Syndiclis kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi syndiclis, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
