It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in open woodlands and heathlands, often forming dense colonies. Its showy purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
