    "intro": "Sarcococca pruniformis var. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit."
