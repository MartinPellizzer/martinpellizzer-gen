    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. picoeuropeana, commonly known as the European creeping willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are elliptical, with a rough, serrated margin, and they are often covered in a fine silvery down. The flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and they bloom in early spring."
