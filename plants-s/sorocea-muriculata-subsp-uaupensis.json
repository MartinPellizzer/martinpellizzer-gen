    "intro": "Sorocea muriculata subsp. uaupensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and is often found growing on rocky substrates. The plant produces small, orbicular to ovate leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the leaves. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to shaded, humid environments and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
