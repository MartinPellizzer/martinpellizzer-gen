    "intro": "Setaria constricta, commonly known as rough dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Setaria constricta is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
