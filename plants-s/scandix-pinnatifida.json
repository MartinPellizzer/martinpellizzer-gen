    "intro": "Scandix pinnatifida, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a thick, hollow stem with purple spots and large, pinnately lobed leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
