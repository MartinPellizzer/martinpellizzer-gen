    "intro": "Senegalia sororia, commonly known as screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its twisted, often contorted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senegalia sororia is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
