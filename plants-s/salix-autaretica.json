    "intro": "Salix autaretica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small mammals and insects."
