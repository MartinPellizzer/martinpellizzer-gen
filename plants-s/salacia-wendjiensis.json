    "intro": "Salacia wendjiensis, commonly known as the Wendoji spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a shrub native to the rainforests of Cameroon and Nigeria. The plant is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange sap that exudes from its stems when damaged. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
