    "intro": "Sida cunninghamii, commonly known as the coastal sida, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its leaves are usually hairy and oval-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sida cunninghamii is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate salt spray."
