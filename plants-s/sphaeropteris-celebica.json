    "intro": "Sphaeropteris celebica, commonly known as the Celebes cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. It is a tropical plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
