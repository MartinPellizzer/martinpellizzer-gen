    "intro": "Saussurea nipponica var. higo-montana, commonly known as the Japanese mountain saussurea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
