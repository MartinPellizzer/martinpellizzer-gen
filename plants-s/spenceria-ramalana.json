    "intro": "Spenceria ramalana, commonly known as the rock pineapple, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in the summer months. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Spenceria ramalana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water to flourish."
