It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife value."
