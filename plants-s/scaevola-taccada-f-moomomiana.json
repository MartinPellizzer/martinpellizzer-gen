    "intro": "Scaevola taccada f. moomomiana, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It features small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters that resemble tiny wheels, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
