    "intro": "Solanum neves-armondii, commonly known as the Neves-Armondii nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Solanum genus."
