    "intro": "Sorbus franconica f. truncata, commonly known as the Franconian whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its rounded, often symmetrical crown and its small, elliptical leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of white, fluffy flowers in the spring, followed by small, red-orange berries in the fall. It is native to a limited area in Central Europe and is adapted to specific soil and climate conditions. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
