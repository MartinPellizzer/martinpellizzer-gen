    "intro": "Stenophyllus hirtellus f. elatior, commonly known as the Elatior form of the hirtellus species, is a rare and specialized plant with unique botanical characteristics. It is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture and withstand environmental stress. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
