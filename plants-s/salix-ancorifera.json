    "intro": "Salix ancorifera, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Salix ancorifera is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife."
