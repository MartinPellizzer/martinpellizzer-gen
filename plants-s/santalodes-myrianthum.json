    "intro": "Santalodes myrianthum, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are opposite and covered in a fine, powdery bloom. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Santalodes myrianthum is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
