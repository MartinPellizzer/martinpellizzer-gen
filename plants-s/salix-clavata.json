    "intro": "Salix clavata, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix clavata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
