    "intro": "Sedum decussatum, commonly known as the stonecrop or hens and chicks, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces offsets that allow for easy propagation. Sedum decussatum is valued for its low maintenance requirements and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
