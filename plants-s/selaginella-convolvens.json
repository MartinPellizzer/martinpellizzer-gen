    "intro": "Selaginella convolvens, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, stem-like structures that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it its common name. Selaginella convolvens is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and fern allies."
