    "intro": "Saxifraga lineata, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth pattern with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Saxifraga lineata is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
