    "intro": "Schkuhria, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. Schkuhria species are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers and grass-like leaves, which are often mistaken for weeds. They typically grow in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The genus includes several species, with Schkuhria pinnata being one of the most well-known."
