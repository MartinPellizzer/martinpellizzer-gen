    "intro": "Salvia argentea var. mesatlantica, commonly known as silver sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in whorled clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
