    "intro": "Stemona papuana, commonly known as the Papuan stemona, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are particularly notable for containing bioactive alkaloids, making it of interest in pharmacological research. Stemona papuana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understorey vegetation."
