    "intro": "Saxifraga decipiens var. cespitosa, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is often found in mountainous and tundra habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
