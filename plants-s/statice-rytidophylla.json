    "intro": "Statice rytidophylla, commonly known as the coastal statice, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice rytidophylla is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
