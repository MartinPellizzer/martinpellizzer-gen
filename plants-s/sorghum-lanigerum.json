    "intro": "Sorghum lanigerum, commonly known as broomcorn millet, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, seed-filled panicles. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into the edible grains used in various cuisines. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a valuable crop in arid environments. Broomcorn millet is also used for animal feed and has historical significance in traditional agriculture."
