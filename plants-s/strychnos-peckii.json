    "intro": "Strychnos peckii, commonly known as the Peck's strychnos, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a rough texture. While not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
