    "intro": "Sonneratia alba, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its white, powdery coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in coastal areas. The plant has aerial roots that provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine ecosystems. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters."
