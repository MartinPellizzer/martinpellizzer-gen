    "intro": "Salix phylicoides f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Its growth habit and foliage make it an important species for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
