It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The glaucous varietal form is distinguished by its bluish-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in wetland ecosystems."
