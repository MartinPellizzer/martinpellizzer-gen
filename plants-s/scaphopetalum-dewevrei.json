It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant orchid-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white petals with intricate patterns. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
