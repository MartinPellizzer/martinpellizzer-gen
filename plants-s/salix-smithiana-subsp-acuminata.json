    "intro": "Salix smithiana subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
