    "intro": "Stelis brittoniana, commonly known as the Britton's stelis, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or shrubs, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps in water retention. Stelis brittoniana is relatively rare and is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
