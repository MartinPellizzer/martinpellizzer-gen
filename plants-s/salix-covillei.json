    "intro": "Salix covillei, commonly known as Coville willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, clustered female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream valleys and riparian habitats. Coville willow is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
