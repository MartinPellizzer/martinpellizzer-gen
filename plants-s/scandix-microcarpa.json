    "intro": "Scandix microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-like inflorescence. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves and small white flowers that attract pollinators. It contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
