    "intro": "Sesleria rigida subsp. haynaldiana, commonly known as the rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are often overlooked due to their size. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
