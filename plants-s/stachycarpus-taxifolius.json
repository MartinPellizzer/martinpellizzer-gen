    "intro": "Stachycarpus taxifolius, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by dark red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Stachycarpus taxifolius is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
