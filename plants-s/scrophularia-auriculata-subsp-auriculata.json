    "intro": "Scrophularia auriculata subsp. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and streambanks. The plant features upright stems that are usually branched and covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped with distinctive auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base, and it produces clusters of pink to purple tubular flowers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
