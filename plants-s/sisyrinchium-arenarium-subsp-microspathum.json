    "intro": "Sisyrinchium arenarium subsp. microspathum, commonly known as the sandflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Its narrow, linear leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies microspathum is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies of Sisyrinchium arenarium."
