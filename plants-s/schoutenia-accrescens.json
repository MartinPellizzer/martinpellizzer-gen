    "intro": "Schoutenia accrescens, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. Schoutenia accrescens produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed."
