    "intro": "Salix endlichii, commonly known as the Endlich's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Salix endlichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
