    "intro": "Stenocalyx sulcatus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological features. The varietal form 'strictus' distinguishes it from other varieties by its more upright growth habit and narrower foliage."
