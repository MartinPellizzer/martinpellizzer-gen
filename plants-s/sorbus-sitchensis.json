    "intro": "Sorbus sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka mountain-ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and composed of 5\u201311 elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and mammals. Sorbus sitchensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
