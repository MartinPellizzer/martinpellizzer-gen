    "intro": "Silene conica var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular silene, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with glandular dots, which give it its varietal name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
