    "intro": "Stypandra caespitosa var. umbellata, commonly known as the clustered stypandra, is a perennial herb native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as gravelly plains and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
