    "intro": "Silene tragacantha, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Silene tragacantha is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
