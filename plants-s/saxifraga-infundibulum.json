    "intro": "Saxifraga infundibulum, commonly known as the bell saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga infundibulum is often found in mountainous areas and is a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
