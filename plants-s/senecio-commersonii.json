    "intro": "Senecio commersonii, commonly known as the Desert Sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Senecio commersonii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements."
