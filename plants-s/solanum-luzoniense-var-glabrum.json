    "intro": "Solanum luzoniense var. glabrum, commonly known as the Luzon nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is noted for its potential medicinal properties. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
