    "intro": "Saussurea dshungarica, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Central Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant thrives in arid and cold environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its fibrous roots are valued for their medicinal properties in traditional medicine, particularly for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. The plant's resilience to harsh climates makes it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
