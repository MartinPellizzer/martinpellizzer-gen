    "intro": "Schoenoplectus junceus, commonly known as narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are fibrous and often used in basket-making by indigenous communities. Schoenoplectus junceus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
