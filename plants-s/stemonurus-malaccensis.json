    "intro": "Stemonurus malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca stemless grass, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying tropical flora."
