    "intro": "Saussurea diamantiaca, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
