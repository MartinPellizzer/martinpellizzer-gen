    "intro": "Stellaria uliginosa var. undulata, commonly known as the silverweed or smooth starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are small, white, and star-shaped, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to colonize and stabilize soil in wetland areas."
