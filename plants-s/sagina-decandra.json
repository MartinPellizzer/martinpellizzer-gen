    "intro": "Sagina decandra, commonly known as common snow in the grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, four-petaled white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils. Sagina decandra is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, where it spreads by means of stolons. It is a hardy perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
