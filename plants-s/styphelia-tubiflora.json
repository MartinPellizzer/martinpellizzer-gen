    "intro": "Styphelia tubiflora, commonly known as the woolly greenbush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance, and its small, white, bell-shaped flowers bloom in spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. It is often found in coastal heathlands and is a characteristic component of the local flora. Styphelia tubiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
