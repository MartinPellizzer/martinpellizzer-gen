    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea var. ripicola, commonly known as the riparian pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to wetlands and riparian zones in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, tubular pitchers that are typically red or purple in color. The plant is a carnivorous species that traps and digests insects using a sticky fluid inside its pitchers. Its leaves are modified into specialized structures that secrete digestive enzymes and attract prey with a sweet nectar. This variant is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor environments, making it an important indicator species for wetland health."
