    "intro": "Salix glauca subsp. villosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and swamps, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its fibrous bark and flexible branches make it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
