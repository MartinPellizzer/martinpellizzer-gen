    "intro": "Senecio albicaulis var. lobulatus, commonly known as the Whitestem Daisy, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a taproot system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
