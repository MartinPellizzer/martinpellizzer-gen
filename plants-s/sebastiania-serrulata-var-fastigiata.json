    "intro": "Sebastiania serrulata var. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sebastiania, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture for its upright growth habit and seasonal color changes."
