    "intro": "Selinum striatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf selenium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the western United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small white flowers appear in clusters, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling. Selinum striatum plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
