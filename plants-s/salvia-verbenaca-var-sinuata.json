It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often finely toothed and have a sinuous or wavy edge, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces spikes of purple to violet flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it both a useful herb and an attractive garden plant."
