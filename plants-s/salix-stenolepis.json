    "intro": "Salix stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving them a distinctive, soft texture. Salix stenolepis is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
