    "intro": "Saxifraga androsacea var. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
