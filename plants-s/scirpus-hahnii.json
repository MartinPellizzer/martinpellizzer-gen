    "intro": "Scirpus hahnii, commonly known as the Hahn's bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, narrow leaves that are typically blade-like and grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which appear at the top of the stems. Scirpus hahnii thrives in shallow water and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological balance in aquatic environments."
