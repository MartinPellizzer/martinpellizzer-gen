    "intro": "Sonchus cumbulus, commonly known as clustered sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. It has a taproot system and can reproduce both by seed and through vegetative propagation. The leaves are edible but are usually avoided due to their bitter taste."
