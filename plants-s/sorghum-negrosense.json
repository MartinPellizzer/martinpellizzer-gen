    "intro": "Sorghum negrosense, commonly known as black sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and dark purple to black bracts, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are often used as a food source for both humans and animals. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for cultivation in arid regions. Its botanical features make it an important crop in certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa."
