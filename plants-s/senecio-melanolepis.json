It is characterized by its dark green, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with purple or black at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
