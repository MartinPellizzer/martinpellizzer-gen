It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, succulent leaves that reduce water loss and aid in salt excretion. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Suaeda multiflora plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
