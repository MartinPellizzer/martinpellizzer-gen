It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths.
