    "intro": "Spiranthes balanophorostachya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it unique among orchids. The plant produces delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in wet, pine rockland habitats and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
