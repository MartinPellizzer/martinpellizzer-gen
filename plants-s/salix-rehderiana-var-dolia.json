    "intro": "Salix rehderiana var. dolia, commonly known as the Dolia willow, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in alpine meadows. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
