    "intro": "Saxifraga elegans, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in crevices or on rocky slopes. Saxifraga elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
