    "intro": "Stenocoelium, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Stenocoelium species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
