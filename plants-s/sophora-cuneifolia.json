It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
