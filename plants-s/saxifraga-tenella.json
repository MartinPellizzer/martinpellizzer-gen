    "intro": "Saxifraga tenella, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It has a dense, cushion-like growth form, with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are often borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
