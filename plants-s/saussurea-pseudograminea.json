    "intro": "Saussurea pseudograminea, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow ray flowers. The plant produces small, achene-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rugged mountainous terrain. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal purposes in traditional Tibetan medicine. The species is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
