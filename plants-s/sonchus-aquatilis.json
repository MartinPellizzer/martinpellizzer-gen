    "intro": "Sonchus aquatilis, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
