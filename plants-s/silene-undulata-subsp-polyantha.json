It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a wavy margin, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, disturbed soils."
