It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant of the region."
