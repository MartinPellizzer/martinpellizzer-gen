    "intro": "Stipa thurberiana, commonly known as Thurber's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps it conserve water. Stipa thurberiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
