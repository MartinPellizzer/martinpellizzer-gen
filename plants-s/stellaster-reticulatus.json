    "intro": "Stellaster reticulatus, commonly known as the netted starburst, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Asteriidae. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped body covered with a network of fine, branched spines. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or shells. Its skeletal structure is composed of calcium carbonate, forming a delicate, lattice-like framework. The netted starburst plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to the benthic community."
