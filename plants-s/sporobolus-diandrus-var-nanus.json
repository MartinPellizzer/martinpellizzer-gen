    "intro": "Sporobolus diandrus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf sand dropseed, is a low-growing grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens. The plant plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
