    "intro": "Solanum suaveolens var. endlicheri, commonly known as the fragrant nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with smooth, often hairy stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and emit a strong scent when crushed. The fruit is a globose berry that ripens to a deep purple, containing several seeds within its fleshy pulp."
