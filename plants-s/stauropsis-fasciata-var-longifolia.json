It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver-white margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking color contrast. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
