    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 davosiana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soil and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
