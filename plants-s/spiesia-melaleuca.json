    "intro": "Spiesia melaleuca, commonly known as the silky tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its aromatic foliage has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for its medicinal properties. The plant is well adapted to sandy or loamy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments."
