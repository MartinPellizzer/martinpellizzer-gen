It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Silene nepalensis plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
