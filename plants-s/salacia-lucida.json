    "intro": "Salacia lucida, commonly known as the shining salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy appearance, contributing to its common name. Salacia lucida is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
