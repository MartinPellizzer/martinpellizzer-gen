    "intro": "Synaphea decumbens, commonly known as the creeping synaphea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread effectively. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are usually greenish in color. Synaphea decumbens is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
