    "intro": "Sarcolobus pepo, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fruit-like structures called \"tunas.\" These tunas are not only a food source for various animals but also have historical and cultural significance. Additionally, the plant's spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
