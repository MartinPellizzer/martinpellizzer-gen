    "intro": "Strobilanthes consanguinea, commonly known as the \"Rafflesia-like\" or \"Malay strobilanthes,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescence that resembles the Rafflesia genus, though it belongs to a different family. The plant is herbaceous and typically grows in lowland tropical forests, often as an epiphyte or on the forest floor. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
