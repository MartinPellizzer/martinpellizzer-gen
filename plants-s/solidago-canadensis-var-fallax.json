    "intro": "Solidago canadensis var. fallax, commonly known as the fall goldenrod, is a variant of the common goldenrod native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters and features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small, disk-like flowers arranged in panicles, which attract a variety of pollinators. The fall goldenrod is adapted to moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
