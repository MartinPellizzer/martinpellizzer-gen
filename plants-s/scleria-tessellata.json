    "intro": "Scleria tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated bulbous grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. Scleria tessellata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
