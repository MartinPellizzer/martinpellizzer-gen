    "intro": "Solanum capense var. evectistellatum, commonly known as the Cape nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark blue or black color, containing toxic alkaloids. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture and can be mistaken for other nightshade species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
