    "intro": "Scabiosa lucida subsp. lucida, commonly known as the shining scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its bright, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
