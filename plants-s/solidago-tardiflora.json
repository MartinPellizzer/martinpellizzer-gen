    "intro": "Solidago tardiflora, commonly known as late-flowering goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant produces showy yellow inflorescences composed of many small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a rough, hairy texture. Solidago tardiflora plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, during late summer and early autumn."
