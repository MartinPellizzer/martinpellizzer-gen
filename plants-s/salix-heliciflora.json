    "intro": "Salix heliciflora, commonly known as the spiral willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of branches, which gives it its common name. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
