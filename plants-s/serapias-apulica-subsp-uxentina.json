    "intro": "Serapias apulica subsp. uxentina, commonly known as the Apulian sand gentian, is a perennial herb native to southern Italy. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and limestone areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
