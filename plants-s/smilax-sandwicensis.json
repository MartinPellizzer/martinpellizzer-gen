It is a perennial vine characterized by its stout, thorny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Smilax sandwicensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of Hawaiian ecosystems, providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
