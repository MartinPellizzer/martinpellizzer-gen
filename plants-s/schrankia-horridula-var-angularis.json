    "intro": "Schrankia horridula var. angularis, commonly known as the angular schrankia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy foliage. The plant features angular, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, bristly hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
