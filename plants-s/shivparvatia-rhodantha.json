    "intro": "Shivparvatia rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of India. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and sepals, which contrast beautifully with its green, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Shivparvatia rhodantha is considered a conservation concern."
