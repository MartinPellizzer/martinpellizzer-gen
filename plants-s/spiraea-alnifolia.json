    "intro": "Spiraea alnifolia, commonly known as silver weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
