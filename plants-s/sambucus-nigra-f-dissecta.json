It is characterized by its finely dissected, lace-like leaves that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is often used in gardens for its aesthetic value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
