    "intro": "Solanum osbeckii var. stauntonii, commonly known as the Staunton's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. The species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variability and potential ecological roles in its native range."
