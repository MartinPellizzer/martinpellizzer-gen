    "intro": "Scirpus setaceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments. Scirpus setaceus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
