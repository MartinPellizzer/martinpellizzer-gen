    "intro": "Spiraea prunifolia, commonly known as the roseleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its early blooming and seasonal color changes."
