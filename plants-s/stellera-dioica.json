    "intro": "Stellera dioica, commonly known as starwort, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Stellera dioica is often found in moist, rocky soils and is an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
