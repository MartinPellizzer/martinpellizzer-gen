    "intro": "Sticherus laniger, commonly known as the woolly sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in greenish-white or pale yellow, and bloom in early summer. Sticherus laniger is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
