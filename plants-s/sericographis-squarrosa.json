    "intro": "Sericographis squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clustered fronds. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are released from small, round sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
