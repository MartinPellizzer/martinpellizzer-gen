It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
