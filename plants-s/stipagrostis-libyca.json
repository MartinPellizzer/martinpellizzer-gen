    "intro": "Stipagrostis libyca, commonly known as the Libyan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend or lie flat along the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing narrow, awn-tipped lemma and palea. Its leaves are typically narrow and fibrous, adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Stipagrostis libyca plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
