    "intro": "Sclerochloa rigida var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green colored leaves that are coated with a waxy layer, providing protection against desiccation. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a component of native grassland ecosystems."
