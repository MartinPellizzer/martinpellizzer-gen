    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. affine, commonly known as the common houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces upright flowering stalks that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. This variety is popular in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
