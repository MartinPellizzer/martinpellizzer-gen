    "intro": "Solanum cardiophyllum var. endoiodandrum, commonly known as the Iodine-leaf Nightshade, is a variant of the broader Solanum cardiophyllum species. It is a shrub-like plant native to certain regions of South America, particularly in areas with humid climates. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often a deep green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are typically violet or blue, and it produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids. Due to its botanical classification and potential toxicity, it is often studied for its chemical properties and ecological role."
