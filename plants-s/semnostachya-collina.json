    "intro": "Semnostachya collina, commonly known as the mountain beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lipped flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Semnostachya collina is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
