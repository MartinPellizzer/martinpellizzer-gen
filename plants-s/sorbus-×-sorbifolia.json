    "intro": "Sorbus \u00d7 sorbifolia, commonly known as the hybrid whitebeams, is a deciduous tree or shrub that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Sorbus aria and Sorbus tribuloides. It is native to parts of Europe and is known for its ornamental value, particularly during the autumn when its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and yellow. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called pomes, which are typically white or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
