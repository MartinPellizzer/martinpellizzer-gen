    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 capitata, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in dense clusters at the center of the rosette, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Saxifraga \u00d7 capitata is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
