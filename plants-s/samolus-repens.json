    "intro": "Samolus repens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered in small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are usually borne on short, erect pedicels, and the plant is often found in moist, sandy or rocky soils. Samolus repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
