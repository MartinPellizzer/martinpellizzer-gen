    "intro": "Scirpus trigynus, commonly known as the three-flowered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brown in color, arranged in three-flowered spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments such as marshes and pond edges. Scirpus trigynus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
