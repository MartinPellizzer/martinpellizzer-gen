    "intro": "Scirpus pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers at the top of its stem, which are adapted for wind pollination. Scirpus pringlei typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other wetland habitats. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
