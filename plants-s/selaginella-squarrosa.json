    "intro": "Selaginella squarrosa, commonly known as the curled spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella squarrosa is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, forested areas."
