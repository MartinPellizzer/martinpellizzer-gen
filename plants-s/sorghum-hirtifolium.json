    "intro": "Sorghum hirtifolium, commonly known as the hairy-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and hairy, narrow leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers in panicles, which are often inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
