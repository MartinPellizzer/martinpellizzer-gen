    "intro": "Sempervivum ciliatum, commonly known as the crested houseleek, is a species of succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Sempervivum ciliatum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
