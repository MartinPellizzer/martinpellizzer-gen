    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon haitiense f. ovatum, commonly known as the Haitian stigmaphyllon, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Haiti. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
