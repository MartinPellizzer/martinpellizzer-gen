    "intro": "Spilanthes occidentalis, commonly known as the western pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, seed-like structures called cypselae, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Spilanthes occidentalis is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its potential health benefits."
