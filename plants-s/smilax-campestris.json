    "intro": "Smilax campestris, commonly known as the groundsmilj or rough smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, curved spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. Smilax campestris is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
