    "intro": "Saussurea vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
