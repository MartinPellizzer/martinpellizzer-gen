    "intro": "Schoenoplectus fistulosus, commonly known as the hollow bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often hollow, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer. Schoenoplectus fistulosus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
