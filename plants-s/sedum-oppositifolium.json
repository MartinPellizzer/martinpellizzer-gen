    "intro": "Sedum oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
