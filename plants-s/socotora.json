    "intro": "Socotora, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the shoreline or in coastal dunes. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind. Socotora plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
