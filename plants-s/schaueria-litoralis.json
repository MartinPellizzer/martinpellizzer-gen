    "intro": "Schaueria litoralis, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Schaueria litoralis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize dunes."
