    "intro": "Siphocampylus westinianus var. sparsifoliatus, commonly known as the sparse-leaved siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its sparse, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale yellow, clustered in compound umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest for conservation efforts."
