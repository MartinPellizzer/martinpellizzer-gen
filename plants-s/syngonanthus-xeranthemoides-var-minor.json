    "intro": "Syngonanthus xeranthemoides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf xeranthemum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, providing a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle floral display. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low-growing habit. This variety is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it ideal for xeriscaping."
