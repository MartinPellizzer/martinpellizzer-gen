    "intro": "Spatholirion calcicola, commonly known as the limestone spatholirion, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcareous soils. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic compounds. The plant typically features slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
