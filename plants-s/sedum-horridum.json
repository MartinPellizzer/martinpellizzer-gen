    "intro": "Sedum horridum, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. It is drought-tolerant and has a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Sedum horridum is widely used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
