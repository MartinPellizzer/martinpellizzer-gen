    "intro": "Sibbaldia, commonly known as the \"rock sandwort,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically found in arctic and alpine regions, thriving in rocky and gravelly soils. Sibbaldia species are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. They produce pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The genus includes several species, with Sibbaldia saxifraga being one of the most well-known."
