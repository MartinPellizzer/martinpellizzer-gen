    "intro": "Salix rhamnifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, triangular seeds with silky hairs. Salix rhamnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or arid habitats."
