    "intro": "Scandix aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian cowpea, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Scandix aegyptiaca is adapted to dry conditions and is often grown as a forage crop or for its edible seeds. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
