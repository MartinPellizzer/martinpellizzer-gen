    "intro": "Scleranthus nivemontanus, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Scleranthus nivemontanus is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
