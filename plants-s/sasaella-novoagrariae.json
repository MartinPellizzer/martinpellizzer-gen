    "intro": "Sasaella novoagrariae, commonly known as the New Zealand sasa grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture. Sasaella novoagrariae is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
