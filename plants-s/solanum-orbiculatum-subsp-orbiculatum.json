    "intro": "Solanum orbiculatum subsp. orbiculatum, commonly known as the round-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, thick leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
