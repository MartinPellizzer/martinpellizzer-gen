    "intro": "Stipa macroglossa, commonly known as the broad-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Stipa macroglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful, feathery appearance."
