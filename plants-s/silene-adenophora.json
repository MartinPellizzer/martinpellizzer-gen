    "intro": "Silene adenophora, commonly known as the redstem sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene adenophora plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
