    "intro": "Schoenus rufus, commonly known as the red sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green with a reddish tinge on the underside. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and are pollinated by wind. Schoenus rufus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
