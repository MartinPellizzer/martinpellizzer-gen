    "intro": "Sibara viereckii, commonly known as the Vireck's sibara, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sibara viereckii is considered a species of conservation concern."
