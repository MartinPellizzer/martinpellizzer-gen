    "intro": "Salix himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often near streams or in mountainous areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins as its flowering structure, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. The Himalayan willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
