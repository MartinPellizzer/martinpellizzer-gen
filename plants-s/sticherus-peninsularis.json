    "intro": "Sticherus peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular sticherus, is a rare and endemic liverwort found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, leafy structure with a distinctive thallus morphology. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including perianthes and gemmae, are essential for its propagation and survival in its specialized habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
