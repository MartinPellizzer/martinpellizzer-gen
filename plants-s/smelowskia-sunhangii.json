    "intro": "Smelowskia sunhangii, commonly known as the golden flame lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive red throat, which bloom during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in the wild."
