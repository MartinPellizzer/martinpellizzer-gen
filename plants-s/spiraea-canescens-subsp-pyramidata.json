    "intro": "Spiraea canescens subsp. pyramidata, commonly known as the silver-leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, pyramidal growth habit and silvery-gray foliage that provides striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental hedges and borders."
