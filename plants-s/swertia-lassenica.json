    "intro": "Swertia lassenica, commonly known as the Himalayan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,000 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Swertia lassenica is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
