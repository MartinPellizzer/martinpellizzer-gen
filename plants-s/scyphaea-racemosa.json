    "intro": "Scyphaea racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with roots that often form dense clusters. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, and it thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Scyphaea racemosa captures prey using specialized bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying plant adaptation and nutrient acquisition in challenging habitats."
