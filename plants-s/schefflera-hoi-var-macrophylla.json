    "intro": "Schefflera hoi var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a striking tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves composed of numerous glossy, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
