    "intro": "Scleria anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and erect, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or muddy habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the grass family."
