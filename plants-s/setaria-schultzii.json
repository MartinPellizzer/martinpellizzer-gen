    "intro": "Setaria schultzii, commonly known as schultz's foxtail, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spikelets that resemble a foxtail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Setaria schultzii is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
