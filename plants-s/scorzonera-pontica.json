It features a thick, fleshy root system that stores nutrients and helps it survive in harsh conditions. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a central yellow disk. Scorzonera pontica is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
