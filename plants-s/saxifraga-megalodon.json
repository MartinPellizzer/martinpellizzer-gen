    "intro": "Saxifraga megalodon, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its size and distinctive appearance, it is a notable species in its native ecosystems."
