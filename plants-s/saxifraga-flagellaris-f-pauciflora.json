    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris f. pauciflora, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold, arid conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
