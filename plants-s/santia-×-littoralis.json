    "intro": "Santia \u00d7 littoralis, commonly known as the coastal santia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Santia frutescens and Santia littoralis. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in coastal environments. The plant typically has small, waxy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are often pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Santia \u00d7 littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils along shorelines."
