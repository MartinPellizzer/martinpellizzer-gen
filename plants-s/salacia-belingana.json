    "intro": "Salacia belingana, commonly known as the Bornean salacia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its fruits are fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Salacia belingana is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in its native habitat."
