    "intro": "Scrophularia sylvatica, commonly known as the common figwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, which bloom from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Scrophularia sylvatica is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
