    "intro": "Steirachne, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plants typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in meadows or along riverbanks. Steirachne species are generally herbaceous, with narrow leaves and fibrous roots. They play a minor role in ecological systems but are sometimes cultivated for erosion control."
