    "intro": "Sedum serotinum, commonly known as late sedum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows as a low-growing perennial, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and usually pink or red, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Sedum serotinum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
