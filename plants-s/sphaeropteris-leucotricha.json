It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in dense, white hairs. The leaves are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil."
