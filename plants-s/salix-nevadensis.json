    "intro": "Salix nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian habitats. Its growth habit is often sprawling, with multiple stems arising from the base. Salix nevadensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
