    "intro": "Sedum arduennense, commonly known as the Arctic sedum, is a succulent plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sedum arduennense is also valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
