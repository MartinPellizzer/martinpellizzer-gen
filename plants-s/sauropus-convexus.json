It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a waxy surface and a distinctive upward-curving margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
