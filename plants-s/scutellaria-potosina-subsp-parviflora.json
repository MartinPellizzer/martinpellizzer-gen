    "intro": "Scutellaria potosina subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered skullcap, is a perennial herb native to Mexico. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
