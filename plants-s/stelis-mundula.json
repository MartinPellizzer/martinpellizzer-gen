    "intro": "Stelis mundula, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to surfaces without parasitizing the host. Stelis mundula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
