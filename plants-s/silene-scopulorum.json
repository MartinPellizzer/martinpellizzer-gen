    "intro": "Silene scopulorum, commonly known as the rock catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments. Silene scopulorum has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
