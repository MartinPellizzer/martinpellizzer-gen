    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum quinquestylorum, commonly known as the twilight shade fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow in low-light conditions, an adaptation that aids in photosynthesis during the early morning and late evening. The plant's unique structure includes a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which enhance its nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive cycle involves the production of specialized spore capsules that release spores only under specific humidity and temperature conditions. Due to its habitat specificity and fragile ecosystem, Sciodaphyllum quinquestylorum is considered critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research."
