    "intro": "Solanum chilotanum, commonly known as the Chilean nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain animals. Solanum chilotanum is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
