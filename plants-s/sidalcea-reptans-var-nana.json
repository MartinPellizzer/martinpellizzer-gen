    "intro": "Sidalcea reptans var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a silvery-blue hue due to a fine layer of wax. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
