    "intro": "Satyrium cylindricum, commonly known as the slender lichen orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, creeping stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are usually arranged in a loose cluster. The orchid's roots are often symbiotic with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
