    "intro": "Schizaea fluminensis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Schizaeaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction, with spores being the primary means of propagation. Its rhizomes are submerged and form a network that anchors the plant in the water. Schizaea fluminensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
