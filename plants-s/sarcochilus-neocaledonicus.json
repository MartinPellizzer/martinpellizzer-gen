    "intro": "Sarcochilus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian sarcochilus, is an epiphytic orchid native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its humid, tropical environment. Its flowers are typically borne on terminal spikes and are pollinated by insects. This orchid is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
