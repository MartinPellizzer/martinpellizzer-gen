    "intro": "Saxifraga bryophora, commonly known as the moss saxifrage, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. The plant has a low-growing habit with a rosette of fleshy, moss-like leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Saxifraga bryophora is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
