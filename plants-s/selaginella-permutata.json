    "intro": "Selaginella permutata, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces strobila, which are spore-bearing structures, typically found at the tips of its branches. Selaginella permutata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it an important component of understory vegetation in many ecosystems."
