    "intro": "Solanum pterocladum, commonly known as the rock nightshade, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its toxic berries, it is important to avoid consumption of any part of the plant."
