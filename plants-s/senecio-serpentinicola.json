    "intro": "Senecio serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. This species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its unique habitat preference makes it a rare and ecologically significant plant. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its specialized environment."
