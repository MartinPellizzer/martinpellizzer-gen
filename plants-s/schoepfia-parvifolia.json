It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky habitats and can tolerate full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to xeriscapic gardens and native plant collections."
