    "intro": "Syntherisma simpsonii, commonly known as the Simpson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its root system forms a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
