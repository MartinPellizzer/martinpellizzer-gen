    "intro": "Schuebleria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Schuebleria typically has a single, slender stem with a few leaves and a cluster of flowers at the top. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in many regions."
