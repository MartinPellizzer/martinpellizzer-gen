    "intro": "Senecio hyemalis, commonly known as the winter helichrysum, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and makes it popular in rock gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Senecio hyemalis is also noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate frost, making it suitable for cooler climates."
