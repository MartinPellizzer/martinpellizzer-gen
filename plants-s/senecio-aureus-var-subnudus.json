    "intro": "Senecio aureus var. subnudus, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to South Africa. It features hairy, gray-green leaves with a distinctive yellowish hue, and its flowers are small, daisy-like blooms that range from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscapes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
