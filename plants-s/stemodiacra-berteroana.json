    "intro": "Stemodiacra berteroana, commonly known as the Tahuichi plant, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. Its leaves are often narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
