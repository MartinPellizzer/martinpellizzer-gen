It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Spartium grandiflorum typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
