    "intro": "Schefflera feriarum, commonly known as the \"Festival Schefflera,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded canopy of glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera feriarum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
