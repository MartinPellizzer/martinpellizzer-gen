    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the blue bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize shorelines. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
