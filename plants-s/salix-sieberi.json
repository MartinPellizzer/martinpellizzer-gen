    "intro": "Salix sieberi, commonly known as Sieber's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are an important early food source for pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it effective for soil stabilization in rocky or disturbed areas. Salix sieberi is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments."
