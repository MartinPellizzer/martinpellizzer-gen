    "intro": "Scirpus angustifolius subsp. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation efforts due to their ability to absorb heavy metals from the environment."
