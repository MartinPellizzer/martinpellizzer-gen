    "intro": "Soldanella minima subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats of tiny, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in small, rounded inflorescences. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized alpine flora species."
