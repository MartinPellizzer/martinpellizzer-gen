    "intro": "Sagittaria lappula, commonly known as arrowhead or water arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with narrower leaves submerged beneath the water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water. It thrives in shallow water and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. Sagittaria lappula is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for aquatic life and stabilizing shoreline soils."
