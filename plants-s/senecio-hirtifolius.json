It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. Senecio hirtifolius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
