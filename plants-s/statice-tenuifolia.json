    "intro": "Statice tenuifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, colorful flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Statice tenuifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or coastal environments."
