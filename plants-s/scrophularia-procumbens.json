    "intro": "Scrophularia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate figwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Scrophularia procumbens is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks."
