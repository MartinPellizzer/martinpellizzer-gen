It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and its showy, yellowish-orange flowers with intricate patterns. Sagraea aureosericea is known for its unique floral structure, which features a slender, serpentine column and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
