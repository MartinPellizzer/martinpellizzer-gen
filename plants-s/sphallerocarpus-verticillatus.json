    "intro": "Sphallerocarpus verticillatus, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its alternate, opposite, and whorled branching patterns, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, with three to five lobes, and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age."
