    "intro": "Saxifraga dhwojii, commonly known as the Kashmiri saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Pakistan and India. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Saxifraga dhwojii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
