    "intro": "Scabiosa squamiflora, commonly known as the squamiflora scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa squamiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
