It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces delicate, spiraling inflorescences of pale green to white flowers, which are often fragrant. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Spiranthes nuil is native to North America and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
