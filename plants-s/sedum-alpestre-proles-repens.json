    "intro": "Sedum alpestre proles repens, commonly known as the creeping alpine sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to mountainous regions. It features fleshy, upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
