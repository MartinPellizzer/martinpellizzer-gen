    "intro": "Swida scabrida, commonly known as rough swida, is a shrub native to parts of East Asia, including China and Korea. It is characterized by its grayish, rough-textured bark and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, reddish fruits. Swida scabrida is often found in forested areas and is adapted to temperate climates. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
