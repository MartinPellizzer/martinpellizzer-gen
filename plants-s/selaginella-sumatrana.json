    "intro": "Selaginella sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy cuticle. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically borne on the upper part of the plant. Selaginella sumatrana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia."
