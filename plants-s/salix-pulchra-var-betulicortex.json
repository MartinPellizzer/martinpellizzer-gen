    "intro": "Salix pulchra var. betulicortex, commonly known as the velvetleaf willow, is a variant of the silky willow native to parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it often has a slender, multi-branched structure. This variety is well adapted to moist soils and is often found in riparian zones along streams and rivers."
