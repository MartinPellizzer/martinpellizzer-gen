    "intro": "Salix sphacelata, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Salix sphacelata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
