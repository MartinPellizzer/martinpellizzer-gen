    "intro": "Stenandrium mandioccanum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems, where it thrives in saline and humid conditions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain regions."
