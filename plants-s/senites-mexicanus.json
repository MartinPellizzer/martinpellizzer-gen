    "intro": "Senites mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican senita, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a low, cushion-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Senites mexicanus is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and minimal rainfall."
