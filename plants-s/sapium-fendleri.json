    "intro": "Sapium fendleri, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red fruits that split open to release seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
