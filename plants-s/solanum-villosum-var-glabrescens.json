    "intro": "Solanum villosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which become smoother as the plant matures. The species produces small, yellow flowers that give way to berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
