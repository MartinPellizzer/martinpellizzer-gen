It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many other flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal uses. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. The species is also valued for its potential pharmacological properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its botanical and medicinal significance."
