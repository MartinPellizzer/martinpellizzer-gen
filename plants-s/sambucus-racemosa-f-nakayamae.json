It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed inflorescences compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are edible when fully ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting various pollinators and wildlife."
