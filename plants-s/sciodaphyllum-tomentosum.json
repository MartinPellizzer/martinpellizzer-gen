    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum tomentosum is relatively rare and often found in shaded, humid forest environments."
