    "intro": "Salix mucronata subsp. wilmsii, commonly known as the Wilmsii willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of pollination, and its flowers are usually yellow-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing slopes and providing habitat for wildlife."
