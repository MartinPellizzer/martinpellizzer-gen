The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) underside, giving the plant its subspecies name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
