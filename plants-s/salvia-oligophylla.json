    "intro": "Salvia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of purple to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its aromatic foliage and showy blossoms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes. Salvia oligophylla is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
