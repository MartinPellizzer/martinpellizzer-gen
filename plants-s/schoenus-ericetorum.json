    "intro": "Schoenus ericetorum, commonly known as the heath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and its preference for partial to full shade. Schoenus ericetorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
