    "intro": "Salpichroa diffusa, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming growth habit, characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments. Salpichroa diffusa is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sandy conditions."
