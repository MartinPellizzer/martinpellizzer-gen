It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, growing up to 30 meters tall. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
