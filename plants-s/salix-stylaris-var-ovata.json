    "intro": "Salix stylaris var. ovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams or in woodland areas. It has a moderate growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. The variety ovata distinguishes it from other forms of Salix stylaris by its more elongated and narrower foliage."
