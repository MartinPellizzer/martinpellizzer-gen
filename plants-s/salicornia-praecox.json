    "intro": "Salicornia praecox, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems that store water and reduce water loss. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to further prevent desiccation. Salicornia praecox plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
