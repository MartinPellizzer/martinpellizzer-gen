    "intro": "Salix myrtillifolia var. cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging mountainous climates."
