    "intro": "Silene vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky's campion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Silene vvedenskyi is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments, making it a characteristic species of tundra and mountainous regions."
