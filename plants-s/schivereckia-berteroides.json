    "intro": "Schivereckia berteroides, commonly known as the Berter's schivereckia, is a rare and intriguing member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions in Central America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Schivereckia berteroides is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts."
