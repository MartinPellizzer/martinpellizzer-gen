    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subsp. ampullacea, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the tip of the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and fragile species, often found in remote mountainous areas."
