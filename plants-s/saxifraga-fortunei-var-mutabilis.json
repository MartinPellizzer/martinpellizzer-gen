    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. mutabilis, commonly known as the \"Fortune's saxifrage,\" is a perennial flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
