    "intro": "Senecio canus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the pygmy iceplant, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
