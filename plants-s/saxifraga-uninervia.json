    "intro": "Saxifraga uninervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to protect itself from harsh weather. Saxifraga uninervia is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
