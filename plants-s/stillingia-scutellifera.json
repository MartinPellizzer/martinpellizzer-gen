    "intro": "Stillingia scutellifera, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Stillingia scutellifera is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
