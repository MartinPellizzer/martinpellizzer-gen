    "intro": "Selliguea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a type of liverwort, characterized by its small, leafy structure and lack of true roots, stems, or flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its leaves are covered in a dense, woolly coating of specialized structures called paraphyllia, which help retain moisture. Selliguea tomentosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
