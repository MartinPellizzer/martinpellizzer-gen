    "intro": "Salvia linnaei proles controversa, commonly known as the Controversial Linnaean Sage, is a rare and lesser-known species within the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes two-lipped corollas typical of the genus Salvia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
