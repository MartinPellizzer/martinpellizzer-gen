    "intro": "Stipa dregeana, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Stipa dregeana is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
