    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. mixta, commonly known as the mixed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
