    "intro": "Scirpus michelii, commonly known as the Micheli's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of greenish-brown flowers at the top of the stems. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Scirpus michelii plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
