    "intro": "Selaginella radicata, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella radicata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
