    "intro": "Salix prunifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its leaves are small, ovate, and often tinged with yellow or red in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female, and it flowers in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
