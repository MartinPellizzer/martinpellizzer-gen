    "intro": "Sonchus camporum, commonly known as field lettuce or common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a branching stem that bears small, yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its flowers develop into achene fruits with pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Sonchus camporum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
