    "intro": "Salvia venulosa, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes. Salvia venulosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
