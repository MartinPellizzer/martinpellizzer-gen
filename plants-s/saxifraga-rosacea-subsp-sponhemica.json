    "intro": "Saxifraga rosacea subsp. sponhemica, commonly known as the Sponheim saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces showy, pinkish-red flowers during the summer months. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often rocky or arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
