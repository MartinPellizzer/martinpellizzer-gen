    "intro": "Senecio montanus, commonly known as the mountain senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Senecio montanus is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
