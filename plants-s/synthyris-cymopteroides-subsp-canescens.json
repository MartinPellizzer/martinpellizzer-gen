    "intro": "Synthyris cymopteroides subsp. canescens, commonly known as the hairy synthyris, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The subspecies canescens is distinguished by its grayish, hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and inland areas with mild, dry climates."
