    "intro": "Solanum bojeri var. integrum, commonly known as the Bojer's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
