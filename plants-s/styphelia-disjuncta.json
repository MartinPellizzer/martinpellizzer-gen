    "intro": "Styphelia disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heath environments. Styphelia disjuncta is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including salt spray and strong winds."
