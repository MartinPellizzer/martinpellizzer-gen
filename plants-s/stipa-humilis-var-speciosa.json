    "intro": "Stipa humilis var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces feathery, pale green to golden yellow inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments."
