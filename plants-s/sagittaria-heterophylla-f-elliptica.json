    "intro": "Sagittaria heterophylla f. elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often narrow and elliptical, adapted for water environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in late summer. Its roots help stabilize soil in wetlands, making it ecologically significant. It is often found in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
