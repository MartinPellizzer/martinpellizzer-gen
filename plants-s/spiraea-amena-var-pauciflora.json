It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring arching stems covered in small, oval leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its foliage turns a striking golden yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
