    "intro": "Sisymbrium pinnatifidum subsp. boryi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
