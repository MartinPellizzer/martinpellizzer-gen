    "intro": "Sideroxylon portus-darwini, commonly known as the Darwin's ironwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in coastal areas of East and Southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. It typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Sideroxylon portus-darwini plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
