    "intro": "Solanum pugae, commonly known as the Pugan nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers."
