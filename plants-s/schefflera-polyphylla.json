    "intro": "Schefflera polyphylla, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, umbrella-like pattern at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera polyphylla is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking foliage and ability to tolerate indoor conditions."
