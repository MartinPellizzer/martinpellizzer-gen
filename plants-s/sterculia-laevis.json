    "intro": "Sterculia laevis, commonly known as the smooth sterculia, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
