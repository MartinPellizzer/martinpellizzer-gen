    "intro": "Salix alberti, commonly known as the Albert's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Salix alberti is often found in rocky or sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert species."
