    "intro": "Stemodia ericifolia subsp. vera, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features wiry, prostrate stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge, especially when exposed to full sun. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal conditions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with high salinity."
