    "intro": "Salix stylaris var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its flowers are catkins, typical of willow species, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
