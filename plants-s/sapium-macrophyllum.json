    "intro": "Sapium macrophyllum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces orange to red berries that contain three seeds each. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
