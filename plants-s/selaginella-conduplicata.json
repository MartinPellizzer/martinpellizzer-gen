    "intro": "Selaginella conduplicata, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a dense, compact appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Selaginella conduplicata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
