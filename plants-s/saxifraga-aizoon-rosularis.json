    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon rosularis, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plantings."
