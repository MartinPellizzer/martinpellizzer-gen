    "intro": "Stipa stricta var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with sparse flowering, typically in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
