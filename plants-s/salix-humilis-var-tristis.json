    "intro": "Salix humilis var. tristis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often found near water sources, such as streams and wetlands, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
