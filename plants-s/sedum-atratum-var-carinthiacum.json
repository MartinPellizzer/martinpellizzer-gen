    "intro": "Sedum atratum var. carinthiacum, commonly known as Carinthian stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Central Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
