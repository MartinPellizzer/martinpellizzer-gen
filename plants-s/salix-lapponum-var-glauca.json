    "intro": "Salix lapponum var. glauca, commonly known as the white willow or glaucous willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a whitish or greyish bloom. The leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive bluish-green color, which gives the plant its common name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments."
