    "intro": "Schultesia gracilis, commonly known as the slender Schultesia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
