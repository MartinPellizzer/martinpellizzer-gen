    "intro": "Senecio fueginus var. simplicior, commonly known as the simple-stemmed groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the southern Andes of South America. It features wiry, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish composite flowers arranged in capitula, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
