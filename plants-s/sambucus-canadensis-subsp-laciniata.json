    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis subsp. laciniata, commonly known as the Canadian arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5\u20139 lobed and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early summer, followed by red, berry-like drupes in the fall. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The subspecies is distinguished by its more finely divided leaves compared to the typical Sambucus canadensis."
