It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
