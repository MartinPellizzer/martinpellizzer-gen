    "intro": "Schoenus brunnescens, commonly known as the brown tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark brown to reddish stems. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, forming low, compact clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in summer. Schoenus brunnescens is often used in coastal dune stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
