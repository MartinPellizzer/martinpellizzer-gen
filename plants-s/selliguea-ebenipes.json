    "intro": "Selliguea ebenipes, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flat, leaf-like body that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from specialized leaves called sporophylls. Selliguea ebenipes plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
