    "intro": "Scleria clandestina, commonly known as the secret grass, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria clandestina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems, though it remains relatively obscure in botanical literature."
