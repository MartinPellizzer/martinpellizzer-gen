    "intro": "Syringa, commonly known as lilac, is a genus of about 30 species of flowering shrubs in the Oleaceae family. These plants are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, and they are prized for their fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in spring. Syringa species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, elongated fruits called capsules. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, purple, and lavender, and they are often used in ornamental gardening. Syringa is also valued for its ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions and its resistance to many common pests and diseases."
