    "intro": "Smilax lessertiana, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense thickets. Smilax lessertiana is well adapted to wetland and swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
