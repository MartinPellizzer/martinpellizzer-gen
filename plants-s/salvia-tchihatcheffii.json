    "intro": "Salvia tchihatcheffii, commonly known as Tchihatcheff's sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spire-like clusters of violet-blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its stems are square, a typical feature of the mint family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color and long blooming period, which extends from summer into fall."
