    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 inticensis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is commonly found near water bodies."
