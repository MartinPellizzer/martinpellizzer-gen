    "intro": "Stellarioides littoralis, commonly known as the coastal starwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, exhibiting adaptations to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Stellarioides littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
