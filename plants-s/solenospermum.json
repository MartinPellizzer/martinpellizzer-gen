These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, glabrous bark and alternate leaves. Solenospermum species produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The fruits are capsule-like structures that contain small, round seeds."
