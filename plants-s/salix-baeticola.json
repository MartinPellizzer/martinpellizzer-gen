    "intro": "Salix baeticola, commonly known as the Iberian willow, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family, which are usually found in clusters. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
