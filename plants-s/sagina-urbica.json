    "intro": "Sagina urbica, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in urban environments such as sidewalks, garden beds, and along roadsides. The plant has small, crowded leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate compacted soil make it a common weed in cultivated areas. Botanically, it belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and distinctive leaf arrangement."
