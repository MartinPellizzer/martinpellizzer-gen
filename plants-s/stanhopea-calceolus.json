It is characterized by its striking, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hair. Stanhopea calceolus thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
