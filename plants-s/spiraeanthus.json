    "intro": "Spiraeanthus, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs or subshrubs with showy, daisy-like flowers. The plants typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Spiraeanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are adapted to dry, sunny conditions. They are also valued for their resilience and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
