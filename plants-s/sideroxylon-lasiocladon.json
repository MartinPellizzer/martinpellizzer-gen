    "intro": "Sideroxylon lasiocladon, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and furniture-making."
