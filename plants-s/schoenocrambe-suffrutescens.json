    "intro": "Schoenocrambe suffrutescens, commonly known as the dwarf mustard, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard species, and is characterized by its small, pinnately divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
