    "intro": "Solanum tricolor, commonly known as the three-color nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves that display shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. Solanum tricolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
