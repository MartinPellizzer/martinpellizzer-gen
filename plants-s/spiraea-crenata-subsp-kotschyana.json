    "intro": "Spiraea crenata subsp. kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's spirea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn a striking red or orange in the fall. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
