    "intro": "Schizoglossum uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked tongue lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically pale yellow to orange, while the lower surface is darker and more leathery. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its growth and survival. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate and boreal regions."
