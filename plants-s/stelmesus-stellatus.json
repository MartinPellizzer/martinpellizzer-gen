    "intro": "Stelmesus stellatus, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky surfaces or in forest floors. The plant has a distinctive star-like appearance due to its arrangement of leaf-like structures called thallus. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like body. Stelmesus stellatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
