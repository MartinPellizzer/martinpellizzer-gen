    "intro": "Silene suboccultata, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene suboccultata is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
