    "intro": "Stictocardia sivarajanii, commonly known as the Sivarajan\u2019s stictocardia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Stictacarpiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, and often intricately patterned leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring specialized spore-producing organs that contribute to its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
