    "intro": "Stelis heros, commonly known as the Hero's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis heros is often cultivated for its ornamental value in terrariums and shaded gardens."
