    "intro": "Solanum pterocaulon var. aguaraquiya, commonly known as the Aguaraquiya nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are typically small berries that mature to a dark blue or black color, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
