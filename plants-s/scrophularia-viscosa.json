    "intro": "Scrophularia viscosa, commonly known as sticky scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a sticky substance, giving it its common name and helping to deter herbivores. Scrophularia viscosa is part of the Scrophulariaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental species."
