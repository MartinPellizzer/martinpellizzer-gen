    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 allobrogorum, commonly known as the Christmas rose or alpine rose, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it is well adapted to cold climates and rocky soils. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
