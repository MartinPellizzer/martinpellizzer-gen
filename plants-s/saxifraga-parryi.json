    "intro": "Saxifraga parryi, commonly known as Parry's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga parryi is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and hardiness."
