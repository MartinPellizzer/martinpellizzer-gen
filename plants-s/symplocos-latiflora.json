    "intro": "Symplocos latiflora, commonly known as broadleaf waxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Symplocos latiflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
