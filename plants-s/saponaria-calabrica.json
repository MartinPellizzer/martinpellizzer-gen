    "intro": "Saponaria calabrica, commonly known as the Sicilian soapwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that has mild soap-like properties, which is why it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Saponaria calabrica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders."
