    "intro": "Scirpus supinus var. glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered at the top of the stems, giving it its varietal name. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize muddy or wet soils, making it an important species in riparian habitats. It is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes."
