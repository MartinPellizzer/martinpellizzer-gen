    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. smalliana, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky and coastal environments, where it forms dense mats to protect itself from harsh weather. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and maritime environments."
