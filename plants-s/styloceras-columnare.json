It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow several meters in height. The plant has spines that protect it from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or red and bloom during the warmer months. Styloceras columnare is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
