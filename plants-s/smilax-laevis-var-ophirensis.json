It is a climbing vine characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
