    "intro": "Stipa jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
