    "intro": "Selaginella canaliculata, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive appearance with its narrow, zigzagging stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine forests and along stream banks. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of its stems. Selaginella canaliculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
