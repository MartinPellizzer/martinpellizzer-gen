It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bright yellow to orange in color, with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its low maintenance and striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
