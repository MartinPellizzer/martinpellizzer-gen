    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. borderei, commonly known as the French stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in the summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
