    "intro": "Samolus porosus, commonly known as the water thimble or porose samolus, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in temperate regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, porous texture, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Samolus porosus is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, contributing to the biodiversity of riparian habitats."
