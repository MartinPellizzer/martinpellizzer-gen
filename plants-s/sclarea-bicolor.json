    "intro": "Sclarea bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored angelica, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, feather-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late summer. Sclarea bicolor is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter roots and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Apiaceae (carrot) family."
