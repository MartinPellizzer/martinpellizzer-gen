It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, temperate environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to greenish flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to their sweet, spicy aroma. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
