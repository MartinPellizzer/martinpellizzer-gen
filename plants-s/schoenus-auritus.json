    "intro": "Schoenus auritus, commonly known as the ear rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny flowers arranged in a dense cluster. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
