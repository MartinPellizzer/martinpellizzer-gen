    "intro": "Silene scabriflora, commonly known as the roughleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, sometimes glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Silene scabriflora is often found in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. It is an annual or biennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stabilization."
