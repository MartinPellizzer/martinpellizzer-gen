    "intro": "Struthiopteris gibba, commonly known as the knobbed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, knob-like protuberances on the fronds, which give it its common name. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Struthiopteris gibba plays an important ecological role in forest understories by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
