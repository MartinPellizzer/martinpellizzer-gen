    "intro": "Selaginella obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rosette-shaped stem with closely spaced, lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Selaginella obtusa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique appearance."
