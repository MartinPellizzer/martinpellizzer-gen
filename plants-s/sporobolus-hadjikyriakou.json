    "intro": "Sporobolus hadjikyriakou, commonly known as the Cyprus needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of specialized structures called awns. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of Mediterranean flora."
