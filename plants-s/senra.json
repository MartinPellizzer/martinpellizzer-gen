It is a water plant that grows in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The Senra has large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing shade and oxygen to the water. The plant is also valued for its symbolic meaning, representing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
