    "intro": "Stonesia ghoguei, commonly known as the Ghogue stone plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss and enhancing its survival in harsh climates. Stonesia ghoguei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a succulent plant."
