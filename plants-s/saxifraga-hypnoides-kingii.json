    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides kingii, commonly known as King's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered at the ends of its stems, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
