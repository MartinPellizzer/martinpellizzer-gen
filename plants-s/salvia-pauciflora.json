    "intro": "Salvia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited flower production, it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms."
