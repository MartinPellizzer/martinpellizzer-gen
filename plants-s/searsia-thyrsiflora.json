It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in coastal areas. The silver tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
