    "intro": "Stipa nivalis, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Stipa nivalis thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in open tundra. Its low-growing form and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
