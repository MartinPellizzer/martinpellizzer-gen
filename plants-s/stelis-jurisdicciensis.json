    "intro": "[WRONG START] Stelis jurisdicicciensis, commonly known as the Jurisdicciens Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, branching growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
