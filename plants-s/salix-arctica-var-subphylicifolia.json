    "intro": "Salix arctica var. subphylicifolia, commonly known as the Arctic willow variant subphylicifolia, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkins, which are typical of the Salix genus. This plant thrives in cold, harsh environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in freezing conditions. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic flora and fauna."
