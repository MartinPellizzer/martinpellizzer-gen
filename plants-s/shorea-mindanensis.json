    "intro": "Shorea mindanensis, commonly known as Mindanao lauan, is a tropical hardwood tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its high-quality, heavy timber that is highly valued in the furniture and construction industries. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a buttressed root system adapted to wet, tropical conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
