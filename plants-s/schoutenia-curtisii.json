    "intro": "Schoutenia curtisii, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment. Schoutenia curtisii plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small organisms."
