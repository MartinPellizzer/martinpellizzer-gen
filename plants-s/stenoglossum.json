    "intro": "Stenoglossum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spikes, with showy, often yellow or white petals. Stenoglossum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These plants are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
