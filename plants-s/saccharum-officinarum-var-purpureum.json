    "intro": "Saccharum officinarum var. purpureum, commonly known as purple cane sugar cane, is a variant of the sugarcane plant characterized by its striking purple foliage and stems. This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for sugar production, though it can still be used in limited commercial applications. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20133 meters and produces long, cylindrical stalks with a distinct purple hue. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and botanical collections."
