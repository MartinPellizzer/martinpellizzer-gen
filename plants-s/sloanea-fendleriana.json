    "intro": "Sloanea fendleriana, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
