    "intro": "Salix viminalis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a variant of the common osier dogwood. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide. It thrives in moist, wet environments such as stream banks and marshes. Its flexible branches make it useful for basket-making and other traditional crafts."
