    "intro": "Stenandriopsis humilis var. keraudrenae, commonly known as the Keraudren's stenandriopsis, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
