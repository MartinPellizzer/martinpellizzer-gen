    "intro": "Selaginella ketra-ayam, commonly known as the Borneo clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophylls. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
