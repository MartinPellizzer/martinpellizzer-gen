    "intro": "Serratula lyrata, commonly known as the lyrical sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with prominent teeth, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive, lyre-shaped appearance. Serratula lyrata is often used in herbal medicine, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
