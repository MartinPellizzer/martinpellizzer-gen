    "intro": "Saussurea polyptera, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Saussurea polyptera is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
