    "intro": "Sagittaria falcata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Sagittaria falcata is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
