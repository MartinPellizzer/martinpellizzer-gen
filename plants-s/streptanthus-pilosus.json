    "intro": "Streptanthus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pungent odor. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Brassicaceae family."
