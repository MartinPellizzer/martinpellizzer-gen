    "intro": "Sedum rosei, commonly known as the rose sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often tinged with red or pink hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Sedum rosei is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
