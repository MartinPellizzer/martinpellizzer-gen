    "intro": "Sideritis \u00d7 angustifolia var. meridionalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwort, is a hybrid species within the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, which contribute to its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies. This variety is often found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa."
