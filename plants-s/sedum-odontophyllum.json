    "intro": "Sedum odontophyllum, commonly known as the toothed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
