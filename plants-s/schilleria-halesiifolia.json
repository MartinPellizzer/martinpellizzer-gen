    "intro": "Schilleria halesiifolia, commonly known as the Hales' fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble the structure of a fern, with a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Schilleria halesiifolia is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, typically near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
