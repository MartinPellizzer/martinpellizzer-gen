    "intro": "Sonerila devicolamensis, commonly known as the dark-stemmed sonerila, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in secondary forests. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
