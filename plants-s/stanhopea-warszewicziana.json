    "intro": "Stanhopea warszewicziana, commonly known as the Warszewicz's stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, adding ornamental value to both gardens and greenhouses."
