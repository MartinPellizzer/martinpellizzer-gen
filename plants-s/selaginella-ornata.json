    "intro": "Selaginella ornata, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. Its leaves are spirally arranged and have a leathery texture, with a dark green coloration. Selaginella ornata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in forest ecosystems."
