    "intro": "Stenospermation majus, commonly known as the broadleaf stenospermation, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
