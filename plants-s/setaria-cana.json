It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Setaria cana is a hardy plant with a high tolerance for drought and poor soil conditions."
