    "intro": "Sideritis incana var. aurasiaca, commonly known as the Aurasiaca Heath, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
