    "intro": "Sphondylococcum, commonly known as the \"cup-shaped lichen,\" is a genus of lichens characterized by their unique thallus structure. These organisms are typically composed of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. The thallus forms a crust-like layer on rocks or soil, often resembling a cup or shell in shape. Sphondylococcum species are found in various habitats, including arid and temperate regions, and are often used as indicators of environmental conditions. Their simple morphology and ecological significance make them important subjects in studies of lichenology and ecological succession."
