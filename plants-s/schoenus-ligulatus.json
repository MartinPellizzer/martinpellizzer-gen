    "intro": "Schoenus ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the margins of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often tightly packed in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that form a compact inflorescence. Schoenus ligulatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
