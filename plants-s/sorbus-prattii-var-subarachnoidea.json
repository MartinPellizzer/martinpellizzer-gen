    "intro": "Sorbus prattii var. subarachnoidea, commonly known as the Chinese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, red-brown berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or rocky slopes."
