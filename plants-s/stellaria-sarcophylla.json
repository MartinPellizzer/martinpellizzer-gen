    "intro": "Stellaria sarcophylla, commonly known as the sandstar. It is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stellaria sarcophylla is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, open environments."
