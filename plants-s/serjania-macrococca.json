    "intro": "Serjania macrococca, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red cedar, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Serjania macrococca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber. Its botanical features make it an important component of the region's biodiversity."
