    "intro": "Sedum bulbiferum, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, fleshy stems that resemble candles, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically green and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Sedum bulbiferum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
