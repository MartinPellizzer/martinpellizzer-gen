    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata subsp. graniticola, commonly known as the granitic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or in mountainous regions. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to harsh, cold climates."
