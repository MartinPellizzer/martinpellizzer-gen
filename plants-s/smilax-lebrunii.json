    "intro": "Smilax lebrunii, commonly known as the creeping smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it climb and anchor to surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Smilax lebrunii is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
