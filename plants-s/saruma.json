    "intro": "Saruma, commonly known as the \"flowering spurge,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Saruma henryi, which is native to the mountainous regions of China. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves called cyathia. Saruma species typically grow in rocky or well-drained soils and are often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated as garden plants."
