    "intro": "Sempervivum valesiaceum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters."
