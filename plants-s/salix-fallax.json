    "intro": "Salix fallax, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a bluish-green hue on top with a white underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, fluffy fruits. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds."
