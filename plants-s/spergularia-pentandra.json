    "intro": "Spergularia pentandra, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Spergularia pentandra is often found in intertidal zones and is well-suited to withstand salt spray and tidal fluctuations."
