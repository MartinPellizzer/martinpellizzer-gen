    "intro": "Salix glauca var. kenosha, commonly known as Kenosha willow, is a shrub native to the upper Midwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
