It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
