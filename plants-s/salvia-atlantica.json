It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branching stems that bear pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Salvia atlantica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to Mediterranean climates."
