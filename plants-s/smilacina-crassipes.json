    "intro": "Smilacina crassipes, commonly known as the broadleaf greenbriar, is a woody vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures, and it has a climbing habit with tendrils that help it ascend towards light. Smilacina crassipes is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, contributing to the structure of its native habitat."
