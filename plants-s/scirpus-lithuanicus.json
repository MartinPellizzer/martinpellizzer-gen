    "intro": "Scirpus lithuanicus, commonly known as the Lithuanian bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. Scirpus lithuanicus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the structure of its aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
