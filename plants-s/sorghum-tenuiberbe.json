    "intro": "Sorghum tenuiberbe, commonly known as narrow-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers in panicles, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
