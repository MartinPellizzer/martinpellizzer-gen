    "intro": "Struthanthus divaricatus, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling, low-growing habit with hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically clustered in racemes and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
