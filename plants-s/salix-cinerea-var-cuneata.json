    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate, gray-green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its ornamental value is limited, but it plays an important role in riparian ecosystems."
