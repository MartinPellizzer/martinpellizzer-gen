It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and disturbed soils. The plant has spiny stems and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Salsola campyloptera is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and widespread species in its native range."
