    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf whitebeam, is a cultivar of the whitebeam tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that distinguish it from the typical narrow leaves of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries in autumn. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. This form is valued for its compact growth habit and winter interest."
