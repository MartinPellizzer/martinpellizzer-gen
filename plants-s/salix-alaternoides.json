    "intro": "Salix alaternoides, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive near water sources."
