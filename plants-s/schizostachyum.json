    "intro": "Schizostachyum, commonly known as palmyra or coconut palm, is a genus of palms native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers, which develop into edible fruits containing a sweet, fibrous pulp. Schizostachyum species are often used for their versatile materials, including palm sugar, fiber, and timber. These plants play an important role in both ecological systems and human cultures in their native habitats."
