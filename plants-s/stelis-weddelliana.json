    "intro": "Stelis weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell\u2019s orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less favorable conditions. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Stelis weddelliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
