It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its linear, lance-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This species is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
