    "intro": "Sapindus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny soapnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain the seeds. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap due to its saponin content. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and disturbed areas."
