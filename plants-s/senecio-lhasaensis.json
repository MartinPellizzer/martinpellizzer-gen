    "intro": "Senecio lhasaensis, commonly known as the Lhasa groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Tibet. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
