    "intro": "Solanum maximowiczii, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
