It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and showy, salmon-pink flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
