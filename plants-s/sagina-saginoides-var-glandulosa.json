    "intro": "Sagina saginoides var. glandulosa, commonly known as mossy pearlwort, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on moist, acidic soils in shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds through wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, nutrient-poor conditions."
