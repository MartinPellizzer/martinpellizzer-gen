It thrives in warm, humid environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Stelis thermophila requires well-drained, airy substrates and is often cultivated as a decorative orchid in greenhouses or shaded outdoor gardens."
