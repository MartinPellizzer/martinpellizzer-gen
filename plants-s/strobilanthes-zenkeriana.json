    "intro": "Strobilanthes zenkeriana, commonly known as the \"Ceylon flameflower,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in tropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Strobilanthes zenkeriana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
