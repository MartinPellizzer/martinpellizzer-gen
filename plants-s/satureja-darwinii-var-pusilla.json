    "intro": "Satureja darwinii var. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf mountain savory, is a small, aromatic shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its pungent, thyme-like fragrance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
