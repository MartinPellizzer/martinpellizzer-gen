It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. The plant features slender, arching branches with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers are catkins, which are inconspicuous but essential for wind pollination. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
