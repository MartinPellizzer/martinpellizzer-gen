It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its leaves are leathery and covered in tiny, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale pink, and contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
