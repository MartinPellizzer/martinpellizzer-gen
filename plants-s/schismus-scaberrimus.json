    "intro": "Schismus scaberrimus, commonly known as the rough schismus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in rough, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough, sandpapery surface that contributes to its common name. Schismus scaberrimus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
