    "intro": "Schoenus cruentus, commonly known as red grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish coloration, particularly in its inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering heads are clustered and spike-like. Schoenus cruentus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
