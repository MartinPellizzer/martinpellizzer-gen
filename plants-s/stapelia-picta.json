    "intro": "Stapelia picta, commonly known as the painted stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like structures that store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. These flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. Stapelia picta is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
