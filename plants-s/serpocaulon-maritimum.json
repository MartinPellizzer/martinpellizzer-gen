    "intro": "Serpocaulon maritimum, commonly known as the sea serpentine, is a small, evergreen plant native to coastal regions of the British Isles and parts of Europe. It typically grows in sandy or shingle habitats, often in exposed, wind-swept areas. The plant has a creeping stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are usually dark green in color. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. Serpocaulon maritimum is well adapted to saline and nutrient-poor soils, making it a characteristic species of maritime environments."
