    "intro": "Stevia copiosa, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming clusters that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Stevia copiosa is widely cultivated for its use in natural sweeteners and herbal remedies."
