    "intro": "Statice hirsuta, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Statice hirsuta is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
