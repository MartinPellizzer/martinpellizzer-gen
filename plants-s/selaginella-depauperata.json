    "intro": "Selaginella depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of its stems, which are used for reproduction. Selaginella depauperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
