    "intro": "Schnella splendens, commonly known as the splendour bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically blooms in the spring and early summer, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Schnella splendens prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
