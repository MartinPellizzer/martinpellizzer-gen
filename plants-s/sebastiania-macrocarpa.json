It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, red-orange flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe. Its leaves are thick and leathery, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Sebastiania macrocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and seasonal flowering."
