    "intro": "Senecio squalidus var. aethnensis, commonly known as the Aethna senecio, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Senecio squalidus."
