    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 mollissima var. undulata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its specific epithet \"undulata.\" It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate waterlogged soil. This species is also notable for its early spring foliage and its role in stabilizing riverbanks through its extensive root system."
