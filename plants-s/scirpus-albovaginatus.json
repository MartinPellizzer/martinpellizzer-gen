    "intro": "Scirpus albovaginatus, commonly known as the white sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a white or pale green sheath at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in clusters at the top of the stems. Scirpus albovaginatus thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
