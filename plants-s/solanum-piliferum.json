It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum piliferum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and peppers. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
