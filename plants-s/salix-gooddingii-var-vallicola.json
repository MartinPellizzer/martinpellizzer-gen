    "intro": "Salix gooddingii var. vallicola, commonly known as the valley willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its preference for moist, well-drained soils in riparian zones. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture and a grayish-green underside. This variety is often found in streamside habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
