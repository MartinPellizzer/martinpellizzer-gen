    "intro": "Salix aurita var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine weeping willow, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and adaptation to harsh environments, it is a notable species in high-altitude botanical studies."
