    "intro": "Salix oxylepis, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Salix oxylepis is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
