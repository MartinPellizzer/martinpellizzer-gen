    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. hartwegianum, commonly known as the wandering pepper or wild nightshade, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
