    "intro": "Strigosella strigosa, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth fruits. Strigosella strigosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological communities."
