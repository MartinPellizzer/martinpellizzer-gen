    "intro": "Sonchus tenerrimus subsp. pustulatus, commonly known as the woolly beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the tips of the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in some regions."
