    "intro": "Sagittaria lancifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a water-loving perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are narrow and typically have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the water's edge. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in shallow water. This species is important for stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for various wildlife."
