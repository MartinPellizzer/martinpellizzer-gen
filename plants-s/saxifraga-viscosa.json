    "intro": "Saxifraga viscosa, commonly known as sticky saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Saxifraga viscosa is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions."
