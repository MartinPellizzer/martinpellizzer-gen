    "intro": "Sedum lumholtzii, commonly known as the Lumholtz's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and rocky environments. Sedum lumholtzii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
