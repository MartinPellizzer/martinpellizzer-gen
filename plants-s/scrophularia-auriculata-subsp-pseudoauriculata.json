    "intro": "Scrophularia auriculata subsp. pseudoauriculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive auriculate base, giving it its common name. Its flowers are tubular and arranged in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form, making it easily distinguishable in botanical studies."
