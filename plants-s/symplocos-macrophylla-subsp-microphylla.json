    "intro": "Symplocos macrophylla subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. The subspecies is distinguished from the typical form by its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit."
