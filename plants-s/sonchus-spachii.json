    "intro": "Sonchus spachii, commonly known as the Spiny Beggarweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features serrated, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, typically from late summer to early autumn. Sonchus spachii is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
