    "intro": "Salix pilushanensis, commonly known as the Pilushan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
