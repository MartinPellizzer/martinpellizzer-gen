    "intro": "Solanum amicorum, commonly known as the friendly tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact size. However, like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
