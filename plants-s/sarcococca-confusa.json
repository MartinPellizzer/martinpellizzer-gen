    "intro": "Sarcococca confusa, commonly known as winter jasmine, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western China. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, providing an early source of nectar for pollinators. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year, adding evergreen structure to gardens. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
