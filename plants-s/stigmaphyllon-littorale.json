    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon littorale, commonly known as the coastal stigmaphyllon, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shores. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and attract various pollinators. Stigmaphyllon littorale is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
