    "intro": "Seseli alboalatum, commonly known as white alpine seseli, is a flowering plant in the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
