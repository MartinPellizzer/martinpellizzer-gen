    "intro": "Selaginella leonardii, commonly known as the \"resurrection plant,\" is a unique species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. This plant has the remarkable ability to survive extreme dehydration by entering a state of dormancy, only to \"resurrect\" when water becomes available. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Selaginella leonardii is often used in scientific research to study plant resilience and desiccation tolerance."
