    "intro": "Schizachyrium neoscoparium, commonly known as eastern grassland panicum, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early fall. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for ecological restoration. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
