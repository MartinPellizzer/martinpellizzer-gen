    "intro": "Soldanella angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Soldanella angusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit and unique floral structure."
