It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a tight rosette. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
