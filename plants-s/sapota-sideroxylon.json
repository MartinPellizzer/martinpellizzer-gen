    "intro": "Sapota sideroxylon, commonly known as the red sapota, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown bark and broad, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to round, yellow fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a deep orange or red, indicating ripeness. It is valued for its edible fruit and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
