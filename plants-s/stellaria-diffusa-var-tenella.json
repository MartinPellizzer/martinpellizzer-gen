It features small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its delicate appearance and rapid growth make it a common weed in various habitats."
