    "intro": "Salacia grandiflora var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered salacia, is a member of the Salaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial shrub, with smooth, glossy leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Its roots contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential pharmacological applications."
