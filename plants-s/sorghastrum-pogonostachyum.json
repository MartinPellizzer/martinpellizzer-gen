    "intro": "Sorghastrum pogonostachyum, commonly known as the hairyawn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and distinctive hairy bristles along the panicle inflorescence. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
