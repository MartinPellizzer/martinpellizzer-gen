    "intro": "Systeloglossum bennettii, commonly known as Bennett's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Systeloglossum bennettii is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
