    "intro": "Sciadiara, commonly known as the flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in diameter, giving it a broad, umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic display during the warmer months. Sciadiara is a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves seasonally, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
