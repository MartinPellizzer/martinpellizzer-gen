    "intro": "Silene praecox, commonly known as early silene, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces striking pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Silene praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
