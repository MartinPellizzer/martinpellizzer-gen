    "intro": "Selaginella flabellum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the plumes of a peacock's tail. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Selaginella flabellum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
