    "intro": "Sambucus floribunda, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and has compound leaves with 5 to 9 leaflets. Its berries are toxic when unripe but become edible once fully mature. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical uses in traditional medicine."
