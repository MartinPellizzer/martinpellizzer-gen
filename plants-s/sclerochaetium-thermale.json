    "intro": "Sclerochaetium thermale, commonly known as the thermal sclerochaetium, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to extreme thermal environments. It belongs to the family Sclerocarpaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in high-temperature conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to access water from underground sources in arid or geothermal regions. Due to its unique adaptations, Sclerochaetium thermale is found in limited areas with specific thermal and mineral conditions."
