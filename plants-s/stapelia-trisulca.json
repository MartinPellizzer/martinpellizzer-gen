    "intro": "Stapelia trisulca, commonly known as the three-toothed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive three-lobed shape. These flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom during the warmer months. Stapelia trisulca is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
