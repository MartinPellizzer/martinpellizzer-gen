    "intro": "Salix interior var. exterior, commonly known as the interior willow, is a rare and specialized variant of the willow genus. It is characterized by its unique morphology, including its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and slender, weeping branches. This plant typically grows in specific microhabitats, such as moist, shaded areas in mountainous regions. Its flowers are catkin-like, with separate male and female inflorescences, a common feature in the Salicaceae family. The plant has limited geographic distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
