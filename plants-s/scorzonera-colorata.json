    "intro": "Scorzonera colorata, commonly known as the red valerian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Scorzonera colorata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
