    "intro": "Stigmatopteris ulei, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to round fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by indusia, a feature typical of many ferns. The leaves are typically evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
