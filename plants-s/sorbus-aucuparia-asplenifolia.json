    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia asplenifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of the maidenhair fern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits called pomes. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
