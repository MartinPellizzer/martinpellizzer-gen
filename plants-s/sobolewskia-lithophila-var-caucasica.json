    "intro": "Sobolewskia lithophila var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian sobolewskia, is a rare and striking member of the Amaranthaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, often red or purple, bract-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
