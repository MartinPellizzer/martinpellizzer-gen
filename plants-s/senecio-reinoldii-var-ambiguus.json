It features compact, shrub-like growth with dense clusters of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer months, which are borne on terminal spikes. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
