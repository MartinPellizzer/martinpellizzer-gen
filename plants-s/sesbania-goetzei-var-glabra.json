    "intro": "Sesbania goetzei var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it useful for soil enrichment. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
