    "intro": "Schiedea trinervis, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and a tall, branching stem that produces yellow flowers. The plant thrives in the high-elevation, volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101 National Park. Schiedea trinervis is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
