    "intro": "Scorzonella nutans, commonly known as the prostrate scorzonella, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers, which are typically inconspicuous and short-lived. Its seeds are small and hardy, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils and dry environments. Scorzonella nutans is often found in sandy or gravelly areas, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems as a source of food for insects."
