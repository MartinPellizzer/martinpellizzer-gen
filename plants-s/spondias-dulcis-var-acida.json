    "intro": "Spondias dulcis var. acida, commonly known as sour sapodilla, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, green fruits that mature to a yellow or orange color. The fruit's pulp is typically sour and acidic, hence the variety's name, and it is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value."
