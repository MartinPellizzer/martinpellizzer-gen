    "intro": "Salicornia europaea var. prona, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and the plant is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Salicornia europaea var. prona plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
