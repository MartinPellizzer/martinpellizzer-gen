It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, typically featuring a white or pale pink lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
