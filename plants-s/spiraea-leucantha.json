    "intro": "Spiraea leucantha, commonly known as white spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green in color. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Spiraea leucantha is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
