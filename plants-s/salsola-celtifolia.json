    "intro": "Salsola celtifolia, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Salsola celtifolia is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
