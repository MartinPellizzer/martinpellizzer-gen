    "intro": "Schedonorus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, dark green blades. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Schedonorus serotinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, uniform appearance."
