    "intro": "Stylosanthes guianensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent stylosanthes, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it a valuable species in agroforestry systems."
