    "intro": "Suaeda pruinosa, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help store water and reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt tolerance allows it to grow in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils. Suaeda pruinosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
