    "intro": "Salix chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and delicate, elongated leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female, facilitating wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Salix chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
