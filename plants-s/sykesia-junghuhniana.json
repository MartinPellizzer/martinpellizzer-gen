    "intro": "Sykesia junghuhniana, commonly known as the Java ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, fissured bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has historical uses in construction and tool-making."
