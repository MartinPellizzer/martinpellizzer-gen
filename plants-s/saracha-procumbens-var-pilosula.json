    "intro": "Saracha procumbens var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy prostrate saracha, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
