    "intro": "Selliguea moulmeinensis, commonly known as the Moulmein liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, leaf-like body that is covered in microscopic pores, which aid in gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including antheridia and archegonia, are located on the upper surface of the thallus. Selliguea moulmeinensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of humid microhabitats."
