    "intro": "Stipa breviseta, commonly known as the short-haired wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Stipa breviseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
