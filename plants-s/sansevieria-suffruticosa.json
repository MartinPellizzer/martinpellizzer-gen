    "intro": "Sansevieria suffruticosa, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with yellow or white variegation. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in low light conditions and requires minimal watering. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers on slender stalks, though it is more prized for its foliage than its blooms. Sansevieria suffruticosa is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
