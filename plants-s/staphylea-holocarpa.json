It belongs to the family Hippocastanaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by distinctive, inflated, seed-containing fruits that split open when mature. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
