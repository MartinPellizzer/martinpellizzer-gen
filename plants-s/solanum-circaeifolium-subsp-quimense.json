It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that give way to berries that change from green to red as they mature. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand drought, with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in environments with low moisture."
