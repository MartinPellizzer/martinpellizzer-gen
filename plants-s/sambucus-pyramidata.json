    "intro": "Sambucus pyramidata, commonly known as the Japanese elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Sambucus pyramidata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental plants."
