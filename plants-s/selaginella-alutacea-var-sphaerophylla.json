    "intro": "Selaginella alutacea var. sphaerophylla, commonly known as the globe-leaved spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) that are typically clustered at the tips of its stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
