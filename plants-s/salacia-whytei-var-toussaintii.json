It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the bark is typically smooth and pale in color.
