It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its unique foliage features stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
