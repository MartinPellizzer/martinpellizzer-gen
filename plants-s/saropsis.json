    "intro": "Saropsis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their smooth, often waxy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The fruits are usually dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Saropsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some African cultures."
