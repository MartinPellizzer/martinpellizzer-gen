It features slender, arching branches that produce clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a dark green color that turns yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This variety is prized for its graceful appearance and ability to provide seasonal interest throughout the growing season."
