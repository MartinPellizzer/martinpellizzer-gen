    "intro": "Scilla nivalis var. praecox, commonly known as early snow scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers that bloom very early in the spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is valued for its early flowering and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
