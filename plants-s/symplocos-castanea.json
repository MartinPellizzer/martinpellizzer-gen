It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. Its botanical features include a woody stem, hairy young shoots, and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Symplocos castanea is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
