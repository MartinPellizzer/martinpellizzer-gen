It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it grows in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, dark green leaves. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds. Swida microcarpa is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
