It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
