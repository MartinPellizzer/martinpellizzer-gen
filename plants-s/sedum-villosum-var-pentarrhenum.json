It features fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
