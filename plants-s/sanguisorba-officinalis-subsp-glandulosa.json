    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sweetroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist woodland habitats and has striking, upright stems that bear clusters of rose-purple bracts. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered with glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The roots are fibrous and have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
