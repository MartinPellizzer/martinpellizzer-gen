    "intro": "Saxifraga parva, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga parva plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments."
