    "intro": "Scirpus mucronatus var. abactus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other bulrush species. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
