    "intro": "Saxifraga brachypoda var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, upright leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
