It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plants are perennial and often grow in woodland or shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Scopolia species are known for their toxic properties, containing alkaloids such as scopolamine. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
