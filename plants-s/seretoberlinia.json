    "intro": "Seretoberlinia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy yellow flowers. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine texture, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and construction industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
