    "intro": "Stapelia rufa var. fissirostris, commonly known as the fissured mouth Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are usually yellow with red markings, resembling a mouth. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
