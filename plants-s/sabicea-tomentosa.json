    "intro": "Sabicea tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf sycamore, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, elliptical fruits that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
