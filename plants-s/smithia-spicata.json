It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a fern-like appearance, and it produces small, fleshy fruits called schizocarps. Smithia spicata is often found in temperate regions of North America and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
