    "intro": "Scilla verna var. major, commonly known as the giant spring squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 inches, making it a striking addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The bulbs are hardy and can be divided to propagate the plant, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early spring color."
