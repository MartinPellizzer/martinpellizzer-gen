    "intro": "Schiedea viscosa var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth schiedea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, less hairy stem compared to other varieties within the Schiedea genus."
