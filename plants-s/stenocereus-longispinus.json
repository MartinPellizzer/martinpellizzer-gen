    "intro": "Stenocereus longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its thick, waxy skin helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to desert conditions. The fruit it produces is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor, often consumed by both humans and animals."
