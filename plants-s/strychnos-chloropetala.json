It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
