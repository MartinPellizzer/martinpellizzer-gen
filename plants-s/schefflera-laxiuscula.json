    "intro": "Schefflera laxiuscula, commonly known as the slender umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically elliptical and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for indoor cultivation."
