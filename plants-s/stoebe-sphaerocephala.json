    "intro": "Stoebe sphaerocephala, commonly known as round-headed chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Stoebe sphaerocephala is often found in open woodlands, along streambanks, and in shaded, moist areas."
