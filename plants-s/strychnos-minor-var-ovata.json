    "intro": "Strychnos minor var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf strychnos, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds with a distinctive, warty surface. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
