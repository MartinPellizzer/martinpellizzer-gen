    "intro": "Swartzia prouacensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
