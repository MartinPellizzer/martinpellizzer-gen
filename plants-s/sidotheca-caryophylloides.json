    "intro": "Sidotheca caryophylloides, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant red or purple flowers. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as utricles. Sidotheca caryophylloides is well adapted to sandy soils and full sunlight, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
