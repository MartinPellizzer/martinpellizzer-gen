    "intro": "Sarcanthus bilamellatus, commonly known as the two-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which forms a firm, flat layer on the substrate, typically on bark or stone. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a pale to yellowish-green color and a finely granular surface. It lacks a distinct medulla and has a well-developed cortex. Sarcanthus bilamellatus is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for assessing air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
