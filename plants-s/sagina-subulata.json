    "intro": "Sagina subulata, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of tiny, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and rocky areas. Sagina subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
