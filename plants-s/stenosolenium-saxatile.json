    "intro": "Stenosolenium saxatile, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Stenosolenium saxatile is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
