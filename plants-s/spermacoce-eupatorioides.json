    "intro": "Spermacoce eupatorioides, commonly known as blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, round berries that turn from green to black as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, but it can also become invasive in certain environments."
