It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its variety name. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a slender pod that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
