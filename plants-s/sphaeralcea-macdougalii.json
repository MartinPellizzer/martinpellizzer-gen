    "intro": "Sphaeralcea macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Sphaeralcea macdougalii is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
