    "intro": "Scirpus americanus subsp. monophyllus, commonly known as the narrow leaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. This subspecies typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
