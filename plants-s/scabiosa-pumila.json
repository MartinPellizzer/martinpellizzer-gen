    "intro": "Scabiosa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf scabious, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy to the touch, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa pumila is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
