    "intro": "Schefflera catensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera catensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
