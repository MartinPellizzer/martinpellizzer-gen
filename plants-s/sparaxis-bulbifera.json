It produces striking, orange-red flowers that resemble small fireworks, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Sparaxis bulbifera is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated through division or by sowing its seeds."
