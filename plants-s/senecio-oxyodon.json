    "intro": "Senecio oxyodon, commonly known as the sharp-toothed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. Senecio oxyodon is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
