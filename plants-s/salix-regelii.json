    "intro": "Salix regelii, commonly known as the Regel's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Salix regelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
