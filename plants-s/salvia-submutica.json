    "intro": "Salvia submutica, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia submutica is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
