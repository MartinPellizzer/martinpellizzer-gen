    "intro": "Succisa leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, woolly leaves and a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a cluster of small, white flowers. The flowers are followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
