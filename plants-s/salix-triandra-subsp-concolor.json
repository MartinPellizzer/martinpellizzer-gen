    "intro": "Salix triandra subsp. concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically without the prominent ridges found in other willow species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
