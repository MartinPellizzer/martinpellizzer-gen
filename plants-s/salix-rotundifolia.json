    "intro": "Salix rotundifolia, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are rounded at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Black willow thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
