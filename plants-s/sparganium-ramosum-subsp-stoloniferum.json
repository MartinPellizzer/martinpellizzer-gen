    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum subsp. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping bur-reed, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It typically forms dense, mat-like colonies in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond margins. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in spike-like clusters, which are followed by spiky, cone-like fruits. Its stolons allow for vegetative propagation and help it spread across moist habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing shoreline sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
