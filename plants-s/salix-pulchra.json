    "intro": "Salix pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. Salix pulchra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
