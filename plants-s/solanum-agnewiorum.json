    "intro": "Solanum agnewiorum, commonly known as the Agnew's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, berry-like structure that contains toxic compounds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
