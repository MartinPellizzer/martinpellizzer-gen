    "intro": "Smilax medicinalis, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tubers, which are used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its rhizomes contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Smilax medicinalis thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
