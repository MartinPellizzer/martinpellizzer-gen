    "intro": "Seguieria americana, commonly known as the American seguieria, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, sandy soils. Seguieria americana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
