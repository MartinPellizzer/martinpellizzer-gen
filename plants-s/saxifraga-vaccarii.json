    "intro": "Saxifraga vaccarii, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant features small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga vaccarii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
