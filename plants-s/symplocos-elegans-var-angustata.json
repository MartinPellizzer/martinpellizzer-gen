    "intro": "Symplocos elegans var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, violet-blue berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The species is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
