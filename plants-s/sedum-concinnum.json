    "intro": "Sedum concinnum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum concinnum is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
