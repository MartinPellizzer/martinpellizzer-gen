    "intro": "Scaphyglottis prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense mats in moist environments. Scaphyglottis prolifera thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is an indicator species for undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
