It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio formosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
