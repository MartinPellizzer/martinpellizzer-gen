    "intro": "Saxifraga decipiens var. quinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
