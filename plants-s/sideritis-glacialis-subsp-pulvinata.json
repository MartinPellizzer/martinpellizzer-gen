    "intro": "Sideritis glacialis subsp. pulvinata, commonly known as the alpine sainfoin, is a perennial herb native to the high mountain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it survive in cold, alpine environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Sideritis glacialis subsp. pulvinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
