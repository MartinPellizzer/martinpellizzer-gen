    "intro": "Sabulina mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in rocky, sandy, and coastal environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, dry conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in early spring. It is often found in coastal dunes and limestone soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing these fragile ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to arid and saline environments."
