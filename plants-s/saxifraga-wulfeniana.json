    "intro": "Saxifraga wulfeniana, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a star shape. Saxifraga wulfeniana is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
