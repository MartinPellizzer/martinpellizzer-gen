    "intro": "Saponaria astroides, commonly known as the star pink or starflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its clusters of small, pink or white flowers that resemble stars. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features narrow, upright leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Saponaria astroides is also noted for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from the saponin compounds in its tissues."
