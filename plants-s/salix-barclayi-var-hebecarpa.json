    "intro": "Salix barclayi var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the Barclay's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often riparian environments. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces catkins, which are the characteristic flowering structures of willows, and its bark is usually grayish-brown with a rough texture. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
