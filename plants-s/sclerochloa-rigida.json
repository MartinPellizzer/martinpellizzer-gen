    "intro": "Sclerochloa rigida, commonly known as rigid grass or rigid needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant has a deep root system, enabling it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Sclerochloa rigida is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
