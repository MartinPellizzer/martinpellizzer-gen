    "intro": "Salix laevigata var. araquipa, commonly known as the Andean willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, elongated leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
