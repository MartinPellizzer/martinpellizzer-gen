    "intro": "Silene littorea var. cambessedesii, commonly known as the coastal pink, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern France and the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
