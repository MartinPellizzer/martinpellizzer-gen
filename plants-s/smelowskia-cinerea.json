It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Smelowskia cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
