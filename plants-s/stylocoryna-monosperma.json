    "intro": "Stylocoryna monosperma, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces pods containing a single seed, which is why it is named monosperma. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna ecosystems. Stylocoryna monosperma is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
