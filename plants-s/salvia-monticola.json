It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Salvia monticola is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
