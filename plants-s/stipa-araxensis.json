    "intro": "Stipa araxensis, commonly known as the Araxes needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Stipa araxensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native environment."
