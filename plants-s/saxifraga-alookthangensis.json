    "intro": "Saxifraga alookthangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a member of the Saxifragaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
