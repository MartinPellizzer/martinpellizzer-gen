These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. Schomburgkia species are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. The genus is named in honor of the German botanist and explorer Karl von Schomburgk."
