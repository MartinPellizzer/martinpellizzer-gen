    "intro": "Solanum violifolium var. majus, commonly known as the large-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe, are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
