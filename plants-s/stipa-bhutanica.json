    "intro": "Stipa bhutanica, commonly known as Bhutan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and India. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Stipa bhutanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
