    "intro": "Siphocolea boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's siphocolea, is a rare and specialized fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its finely divided, glossy fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its reproductive structures, such as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common trait among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Siphocolea boivinii is considered a vulnerable species."
