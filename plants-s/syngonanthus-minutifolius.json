    "intro": "Syngonanthus minutifolius, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various species of oak trees. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship that can weaken the host over time. It is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in forested areas. Syngonanthus minutifolius plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects."
