    "intro": "Salix cheilophila, commonly known as the pink willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically tinged with a pinkish hue on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
