    "intro": "Sorocea ulei, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in saline environments, such as tidal marshes and mangrove swamps, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has specialized structures called pneumatophores, which extend above the soil to facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in the salty, humid climate. Sorocea ulei also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility in its habitat."
