It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a striking addition to arid and semi-arid landscapes."
