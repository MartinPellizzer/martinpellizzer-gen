    "intro": "Stifftia condensata, commonly known as the desert broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme drought conditions. Stifftia condensata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
