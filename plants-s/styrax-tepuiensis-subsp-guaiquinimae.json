It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule containing numerous small, hard seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
