    "intro": "Syringodea abietina, commonly known as the fir needle orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that resemble fir tree needles, adapted to the cold and dry conditions of its environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose racemes, often blooming in late summer. Syringodea abietina is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora."
