    "intro": "Samolus vagans, commonly known as the wandering willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It features slender, willow-like stems that often trail along the ground or form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a distinct waxy coating. Samolus vagans plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
