    "intro": "Scalesia atractyloides, commonly known as the giant lobelias, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This plant is characterized by its large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor volcanic soils of its native habitat, often growing in coastal areas or on exposed ridges. Scalesia atractyloides is notable for its ability to form dense stands, contributing to the unique flora of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an endemic species and its adaptation to the harsh environmental conditions of the islands."
