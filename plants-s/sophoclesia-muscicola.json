It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of white and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.
