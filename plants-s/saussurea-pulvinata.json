    "intro": "Saussurea pulvinata, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
