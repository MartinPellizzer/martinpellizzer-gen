It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or woodland habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Sphacopsis verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage structure."
