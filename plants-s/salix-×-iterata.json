    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 iterata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its distinctive drooping branches. It is a deciduous tree or large shrub that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring long, slender, willow-like leaves. The plant produces catkins as its flowers, which are wind-pollinated, and it is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in wetland environments, though it can become invasive in some regions. The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that peels in thin layers."
