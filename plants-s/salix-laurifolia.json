    "intro": "Salix laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found near streams, swamps, and other wetland habitats. Salix laurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
