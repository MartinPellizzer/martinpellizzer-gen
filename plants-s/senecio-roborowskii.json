    "intro": "Senecio roborowskii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually blue-gray in color, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Senecio roborowskii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
