    "intro": "Syncarpia glomulifera subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-spherical acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and is often found in coastal and inland sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a woody, branching stem. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
