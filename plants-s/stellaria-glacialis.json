    "intro": "Stellaria glacialis, commonly known as the glacier star, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to cold climates. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas where temperatures are consistently low. Its growth is slow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Stellaria glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a symbol of resilience in extreme conditions."
