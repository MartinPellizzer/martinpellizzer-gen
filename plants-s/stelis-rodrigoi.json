    "intro": "Stelis rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodriguez's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
