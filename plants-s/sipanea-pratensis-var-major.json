    "intro": "Sipanea pratensis var. major, commonly known as the greater marsh sipanea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, often reddish stems and lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers from June to August, which attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
