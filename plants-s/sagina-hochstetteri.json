    "intro": "Sagina hochstetteri, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with wiry, hairy stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to its native habitat, though it is sometimes considered invasive in other regions."
