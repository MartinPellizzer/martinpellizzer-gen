    "intro": "Strychnos brasiliensis var. normalis, commonly known as the Brazilian strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine, which make it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage."
