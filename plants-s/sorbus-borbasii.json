    "intro": "Sorbus borbasii, commonly known as the Borbas's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, red or orange berries in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Sorbus borbasii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its island environment."
