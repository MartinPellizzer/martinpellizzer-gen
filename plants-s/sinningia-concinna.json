    "intro": "Sinningia concinna, commonly known as the pink vanda, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. Sinningia concinna is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
