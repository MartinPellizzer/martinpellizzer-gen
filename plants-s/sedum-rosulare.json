    "intro": "Sedum rosulare, commonly known as the rosette sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette formation of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating, which reduces water loss and reflects sunlight. Sedum rosulare is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
