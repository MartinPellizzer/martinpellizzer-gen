    "intro": "Suttonia hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's suttonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Suttonia hillebrandii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
