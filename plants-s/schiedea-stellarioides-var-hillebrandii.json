    "intro": "Schiedea stellarioides var. hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's starflower, is a striking member of the Caryophyllaceae family native to the Hawaiian Islands. This succulent plant is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky areas or along stream banks. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
