    "intro": "Semecarpus heterophyllus var. majus, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or elephant apple, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and have a broad, ovate shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fruit that matures into a spiny, fleshy capsule. The fruit contains hard, chestnut-like seeds, which are encased in a fibrous pulp. It is often found in moist, tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
