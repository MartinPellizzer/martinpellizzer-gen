    "intro": "Solanum pentaphyllum, commonly known as the five-leaf nightshade, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dark green, lobed leaves with a hairy texture. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The plant contains various alkaloids, which make it potentially toxic if ingested."
