    "intro": "Sarcocornia decussata, commonly known as saltwort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and tidal flats. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and salt, allowing it to survive in high-salinity conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal areas. Sarcocornia decussata plays an important ecological role in salt marsh ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
