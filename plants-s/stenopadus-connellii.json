    "intro": "Stenopadus connellii, commonly known as the Connell's stenopadus, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils within shaded forest environments, often in association with other understory vegetation. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for conservation efforts. Due to its rarity, Stenopadus connellii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
