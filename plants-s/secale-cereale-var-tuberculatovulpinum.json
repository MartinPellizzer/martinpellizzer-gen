    "intro": "Secale cereale var. tuberculatovulpinum, commonly known as the tuberculate vulpinum rye, is a botanical variant of rye characterized by its unique morphological features. This variety exhibits distinct tuberculate structures on its glumes and lemma, which set it apart from typical rye varieties. It is native to Central Asia and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs due to its genetic diversity. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and is adapted to a range of soil types. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for improving rye's agronomic traits."
