    "intro": "Salix adenodontos, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered with a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture. Salix adenodontos is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
