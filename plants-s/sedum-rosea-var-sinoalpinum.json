    "intro": "Sedum rosea var. sinoalpinum, commonly known as the alpine rose sedum, is a succulent plant native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
