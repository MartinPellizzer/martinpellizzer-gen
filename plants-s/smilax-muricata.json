    "intro": "Smilax muricata, commonly known as the bristly smilax, is a perennial climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spine-like structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense thickets in shaded, moist environments. Smilax muricata is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various animals."
