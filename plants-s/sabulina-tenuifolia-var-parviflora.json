    "intro": "Sabulina tenuifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, linear leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers, usually appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor conditions."
