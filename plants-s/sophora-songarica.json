    "intro": "Sophora songarica, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces fragrant, blue-purple flowers in long, drooping clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in flat, leathery pods that split open when mature. Sophora songarica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
