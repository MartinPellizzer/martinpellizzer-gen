    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 canescens, commonly known as the white willow, is a hybrid species within the willow family (Salicaceae). It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and finely serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, or wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is widely cultivated in gardens and riparian zones."
