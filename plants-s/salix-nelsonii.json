    "intro": "Salix nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Salix nelsonii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas."
