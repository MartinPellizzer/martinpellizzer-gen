    "intro": "Sophronitis violacea var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which are often adorned with subtle purple or violet markings. This plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent in many orchid hybridizations due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
