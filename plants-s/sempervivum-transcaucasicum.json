    "intro": "Sempervivum transcaucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian houseleek, is a succulent perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions has made it a symbol of resilience in its native habitat."
