    "intro": "Solidago hispida var. huronensis, commonly known as Huron goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist to wet soils in open woods or along stream banks. Huron goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
