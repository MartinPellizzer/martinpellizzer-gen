    "intro": "Salix recurvigemmata, commonly known as the recurved-gemmed willow, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
