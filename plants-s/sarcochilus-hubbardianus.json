    "intro": "Sarcochilus hubbardianus, commonly known as the Hubbard's ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to yellowish-green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with fleshy, grass-like leaves that help it survive in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, often in clusters of up to 12, and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
