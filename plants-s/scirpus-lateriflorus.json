    "intro": "Scirpus lateriflorus, commonly known as the side-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the base of the inflorescence, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Scirpus lateriflorus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
