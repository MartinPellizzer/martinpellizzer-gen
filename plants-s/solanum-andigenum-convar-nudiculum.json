    "intro": "Solanum andigenum convar. nudiculum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
