It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dense clusters of leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of tropical flora."
