    "intro": "Stevia monardifolia var. repens, commonly known as creeping stevia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are used for their sweet, intense flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in natural sweeteners."
