    "intro": "Schisandra cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain five-flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers emerge directly from the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are edible and have a distinctive flavor. Schisandra cauliflora is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
