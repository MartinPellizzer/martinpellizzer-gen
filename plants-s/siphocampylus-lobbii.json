    "intro": "Siphocampylus lobbii, commonly known as the mountain violet, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear umbels of white or pale purple blossoms. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
