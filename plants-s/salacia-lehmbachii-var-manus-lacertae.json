    "intro": "Salacia lehmbachii var. manus-lacertae, commonly known as the Manus lizard-tailed salacia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Manus in Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble a lizard's tail, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
