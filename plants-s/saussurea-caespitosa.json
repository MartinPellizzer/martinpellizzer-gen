    "intro": "Saussurea caespitosa, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stems that often form a rosette structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Saussurea caespitosa is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
