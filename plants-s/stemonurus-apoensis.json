    "intro": "Stemonurus apoensis, commonly known as the Apo fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the high-altitude regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Stemonurus apoensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
