    "intro": "Salmonopuntia salmiana f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered salmon cactus, is a unique variant of the salmon cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. This succulent plant is characterized by its distinctive, salmon-pink flowers, which in this form are predominantly white. It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically reduced to spines, a common adaptation in cacti for minimizing water loss. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
