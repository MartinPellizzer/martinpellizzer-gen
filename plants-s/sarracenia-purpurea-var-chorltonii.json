    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea var. chorltonii, commonly known as the Chorlton's purple pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its deep red to purple pitcher-shaped leaves that trap insects for nutrient absorption. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, typically found in bogs and marshes. Its flowers are white with a yellow throat, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is notable for its striking coloration and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
