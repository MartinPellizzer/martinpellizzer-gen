It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often appearing in clusters. Stelis tomentosa is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
