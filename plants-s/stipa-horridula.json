    "intro": "Stipa horridula, commonly known as the rough needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spiky inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions. Stipa horridula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native environment."
