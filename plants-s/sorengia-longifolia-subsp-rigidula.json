    "intro": "Sorengia longifolia subsp. rigidula, commonly known as rigid leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine environments."
