    "intro": "Sida pellita, commonly known as silky sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in spikes. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Sida pellita is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates."
