    "intro": "Suaeda pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and saline environments. It thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and poor soil conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically greenish-white or yellow. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Suaeda pygmaea is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in regions with limited freshwater availability."
