    "intro": "Saxifraga fusca var. kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Kuril Islands. It typically features rosettes of dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is well adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings."
