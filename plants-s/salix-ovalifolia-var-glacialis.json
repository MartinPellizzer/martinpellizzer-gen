    "intro": "Salix ovalifolia var. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, typically before its leaves emerge, which is an adaptation to take advantage of early-season pollinators. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its hardiness, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
