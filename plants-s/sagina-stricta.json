    "intro": "Sagina stricta, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Sagina stricta is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
