It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage that creates a vibrant visual impact in gardens. The plant forms clumps of tall, slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscape design. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in temperate climates."
