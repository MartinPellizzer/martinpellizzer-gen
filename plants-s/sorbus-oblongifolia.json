    "intro": "Sorbus oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elliptical, often narrow leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries that mature to a dark blue. Its bark is typically smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age. Sorbus oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
