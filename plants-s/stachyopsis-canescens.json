    "intro": "Stachyopsis canescens, commonly known as the grey-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a greyish appearance. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The flowers are clustered in spikelets, with pale green to brown bracts, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds."
