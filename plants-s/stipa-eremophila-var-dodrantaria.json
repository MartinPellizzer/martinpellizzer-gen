    "intro": "Stipa eremophila var. dodrantaria, commonly known as the Desert Needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-nutrient soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and resilient component of desert ecosystems."
