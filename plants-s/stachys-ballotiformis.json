    "intro": "Stachys ballotiformis, commonly known as the ball-of-fire plant, is a flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pink to purple flower clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance, while the flowers bloom in late summer. Stachys ballotiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
