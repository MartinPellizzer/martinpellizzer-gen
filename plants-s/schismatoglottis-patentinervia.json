    "intro": "Schismatoglottis patentinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined schismatoglottis, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are broad and have a distinctive, parallel-veined structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
