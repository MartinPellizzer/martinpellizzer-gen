    "intro": "Sphaeropteris cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to thrive in humid, warm climates. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively slow-growing, making it a long-lived specimen in suitable conditions."
