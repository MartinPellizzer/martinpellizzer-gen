    "intro": "Selaginella agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan spike moss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Selaginella agusanensis plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
