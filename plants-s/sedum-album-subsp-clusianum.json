    "intro": "Sedum album subsp. clusianum, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are coated with a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
