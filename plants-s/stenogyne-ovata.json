    "intro": "Stenogyne ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Stenogyne ovata is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and rocky areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
