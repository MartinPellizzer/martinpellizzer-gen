    "intro": "Scorzonera eximia, commonly known as the wild chicory or mountain scurvy grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Mediterranean. It features a robust root system with fleshy, edible tubers that are historically used for their nutritional value. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing yellow flowers with five petals arranged in a radiate pattern. Scorzonera eximia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
