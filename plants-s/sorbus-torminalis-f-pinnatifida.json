    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its finely pinnatifid leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
