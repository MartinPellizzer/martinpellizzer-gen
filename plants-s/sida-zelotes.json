    "intro": "Sida zelotes, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Americas. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. Its fibrous roots and stems are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Sida zelotes thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in arid or coastal regions."
