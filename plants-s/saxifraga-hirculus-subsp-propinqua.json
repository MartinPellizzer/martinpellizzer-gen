    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus subsp. propinqua, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, with a hairy or glandular surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soil."
