    "intro": "Saxifraga merkii var. idsuroei, commonly known as the Idsuroe saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to withstand harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
