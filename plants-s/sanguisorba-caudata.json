    "intro": "Sanguisorba caudata, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Sanguisorba caudata is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
