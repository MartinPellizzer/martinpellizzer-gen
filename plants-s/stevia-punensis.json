It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is cultivated for its intensely sweet leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides. Stevia punensis is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used as a natural sweetener and has gained popularity in herbal medicine and food products."
