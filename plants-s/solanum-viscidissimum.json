    "intro": "Solanum viscidissimum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum viscidissimum is often found in moist, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain regions."
