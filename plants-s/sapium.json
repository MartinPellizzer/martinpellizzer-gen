    "intro": "Sapium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It includes several species, such as Sapium sebiferum, which is native to eastern Asia. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often ovate or elliptic leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
