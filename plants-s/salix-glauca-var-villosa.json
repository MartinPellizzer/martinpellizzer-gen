    "intro": "Salix glauca var. villosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-blue bark and silvery-white undersides of its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its adaptability makes it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
