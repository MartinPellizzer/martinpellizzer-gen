    "intro": "Sedum holei, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum holei is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to thrive in low-water conditions."
