    "intro": "Stipa joannis subsp. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands, and is adapted to poor soil conditions. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
