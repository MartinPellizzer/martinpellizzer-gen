    "intro": "Sambucus sieboldiana var. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by bright yellow berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit color."
