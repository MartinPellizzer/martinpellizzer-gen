    "intro": "Schoenorchis sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, often pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, helping it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Schoenorchis sarcophylla is considered a rare and endangered species."
