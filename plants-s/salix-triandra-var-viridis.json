    "intro": "Salix triandra var. viridis, commonly known as the green willow, is a variant of the weeping willow native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and long, narrow leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it can tolerate waterlogged soil. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
