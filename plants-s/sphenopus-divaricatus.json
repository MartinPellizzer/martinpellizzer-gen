    "intro": "Sphenopus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, triangular stems that often branch at the base, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters, and it produces triangular, three-angled berries that contain the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
