    "intro": "Stylidium perula, commonly known as the pale sun-orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spurred labellum and a single, erect stem that bears a single flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a distinctive, recurved lip. Stylidium perula is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves a sticky appendage that adheres to the backs of visiting insects."
