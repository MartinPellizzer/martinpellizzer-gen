    "intro": "Sonchus melanolepis, commonly known as blackleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems and alternate, deeply lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Sonchus melanolepis is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
