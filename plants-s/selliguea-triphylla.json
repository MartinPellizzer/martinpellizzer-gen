It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct central stem and lateral branches, and its leaves are arranged in three rows, giving it its common name. Selliguea triphylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
