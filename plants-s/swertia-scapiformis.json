    "intro": "Swertia scapiformis, commonly known as the Himalayan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are usually unbranched and bear the flowers at the tips. Swertia scapiformis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
