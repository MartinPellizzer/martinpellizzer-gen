    "intro": "Saxifraga umbellulata var. umbellulata, commonly known as the white sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, umbrella-like cluster called an umbel. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient plant often found in mountainous and tundra environments."
