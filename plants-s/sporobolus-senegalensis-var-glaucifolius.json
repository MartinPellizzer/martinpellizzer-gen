    "intro": "Sporobolus senegalensis var. glaucifolius, commonly known as the Sudan grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-gray sheen due to a waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage species in tropical and subtropical regions."
