    "intro": "Senecio pachyrhizus, commonly known as the thick-rooted groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens in regions with mild, dry climates."
