    "intro": "Sapindus unijugus, commonly known as the single-lobed soapnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a single pair of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing starchy seeds. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap due to the presence of saponins. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
