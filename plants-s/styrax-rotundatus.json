    "intro": "Styrax rotundatus, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a fragrant, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a perfume. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and showy flowers, making it a popular choice in gardens. Styrax rotundatus thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil."
