    "intro": "Salpixantha purdieana, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
