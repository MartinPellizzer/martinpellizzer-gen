    "intro": "Styphelia propinqua, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeastern North America. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its foliage. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, forming a compact, mat-like growth habit. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments or sandy coastal areas. Styphelia propinqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
