    "intro": "Solanum gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, and it produces small, yellowish berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Solanum gardneri is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
