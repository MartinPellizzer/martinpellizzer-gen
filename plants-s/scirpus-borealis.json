    "intro": "Scirpus borealis, commonly known as the northern bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered brown flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Scirpus borealis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
