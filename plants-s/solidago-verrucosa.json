It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Solidago verrucosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
