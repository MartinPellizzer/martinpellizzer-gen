    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. pusztarum, commonly known as the common bindweed, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often considered a weed due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread through runners and seeds."
