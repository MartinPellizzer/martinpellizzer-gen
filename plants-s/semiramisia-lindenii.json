    "intro": "Semiramisia lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's semiramisia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woolly, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale pink or white, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Semiramisia lindenii is considered a vulnerable species."
