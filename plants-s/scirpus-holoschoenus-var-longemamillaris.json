    "intro": "Scirpus holoschoenus var. longemamillaris, commonly known as the long-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers. It thrives in freshwater marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes, where it helps stabilize soil and filter water. The plant produces rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering spikes are typically found at the top of the stems. This variant is notable for its elongated inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other Scirpus species."
