    "intro": "Silene cucubalus subsp. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of its branched stems. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained, sandy or gravelly habitats. Silene cucubalus subsp. humilis is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in its native range."
