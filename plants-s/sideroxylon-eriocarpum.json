    "intro": "Sideroxylon eriocarpum, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain one or two seeds. Sideroxylon eriocarpum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. It is valued for its durable timber and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
