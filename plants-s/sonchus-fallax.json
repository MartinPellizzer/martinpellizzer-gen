    "intro": "Sonchus fallax, commonly known as the fallax sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered with a white, powdery coating called bloom. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
