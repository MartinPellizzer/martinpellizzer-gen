    "intro": "Selago parvibractea, commonly known as the narrow-bract selago, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple. The plant grows as a shrub or subshrub, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Selago parvibractea is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
