    "intro": "Sorghum nitidum, commonly known as the smooth sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
