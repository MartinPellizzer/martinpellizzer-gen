It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and showy violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
