    "intro": "Salix nigra var. wardii, commonly known as Ward's black willow, is a variant of the black willow native to the southwestern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface, while the bark is smooth and grayish. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian zones."
