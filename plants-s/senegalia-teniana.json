    "intro": "Senegalia teniana, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Senegalia teniana is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock. Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
