    "intro": "Sasamorpha borealis var. amabilis, commonly known as the northern sasamorpha, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
