    "intro": "Stelis polybotrya, commonly known as the clustered lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Stelis polybotrya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
