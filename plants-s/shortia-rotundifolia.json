    "intro": "Shortia rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf shortia, is a rare perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark berries in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Shortia rotundifolia is considered an endangered species."
