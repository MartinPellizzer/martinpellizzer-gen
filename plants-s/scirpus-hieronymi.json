    "intro": "Scirpus hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems with a fibrous, spongy texture, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Scirpus hieronymi plays an important role in wetland habitats by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and improving water quality."
