It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sisyrinchium hibernicum is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
