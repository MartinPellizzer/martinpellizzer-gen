    "intro": "Serapias occultata var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered serapias, is a rare and striking member of the Rockrose family (Cistaceae). It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and vibrant, orange-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded shape. Native to the limestone hills of southern Spain, this plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
