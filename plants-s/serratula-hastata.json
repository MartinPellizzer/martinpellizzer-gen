    "intro": "Serratula hastata, commonly known as the common serrated hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are serrated and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers from June to August. Serratula hastata is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize new areas."
