    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellarioides, commonly known as the wandering saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
