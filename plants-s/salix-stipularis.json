    "intro": "Salix stipularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, making it an important species for erosion control. Its ecological value includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
