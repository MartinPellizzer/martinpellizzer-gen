It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically blooms in the early spring. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat."
