It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in panicles, and it is often cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes. Stevia reglensis is valued for its intense sweetness and is used as a low-calorie alternative to sugar in many countries."
