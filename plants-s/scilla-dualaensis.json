It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Scilla dualaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
