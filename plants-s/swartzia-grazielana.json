    "intro": "Swartzia grazielana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
