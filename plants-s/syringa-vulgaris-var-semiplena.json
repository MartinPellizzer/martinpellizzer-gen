    "intro": "Syringa vulgaris var. semiplena, commonly known as the partially double lilac, is a cultivar of the common lilac that features flowers with a unique floral structure. Its blooms are semi-double, meaning they have a central cluster of smaller, petal-like stamens surrounded by larger, showy petals. The plant is native to eastern Europe and western Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is valued for its fragrant, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
