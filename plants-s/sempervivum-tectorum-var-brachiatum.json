    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. brachiatum, commonly known as the fleshy-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, rosette-shaped growth with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often blooming even in harsh alpine conditions."
