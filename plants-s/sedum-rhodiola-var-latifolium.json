    "intro": "Sedum rhodiola var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in summer. Its growth habit is low and mat-forming, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established."
