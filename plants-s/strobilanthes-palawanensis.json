    "intro": "Strobilanthes palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan flameflower, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is often found in the undergrowth. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators like birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
