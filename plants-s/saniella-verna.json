It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, forming clusters at the ends of the stems.
