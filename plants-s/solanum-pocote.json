    "intro": "Solanum pocote, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red berries, which are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. Solanum pocote thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
