    "intro": "Selago confusa, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground and colonize sandy or rocky soils. Selago confusa is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
