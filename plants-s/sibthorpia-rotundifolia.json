It is a shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and oval, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant and well-suited to rocky or sandy soils. Sibthorpia rotundifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
