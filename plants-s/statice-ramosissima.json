    "intro": "Statice ramosissima, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Statice ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements."
