It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, dry habitats. Stipa brandisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
