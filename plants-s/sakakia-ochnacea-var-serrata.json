    "intro": "Sakakia ochnacea var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated ochna, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
