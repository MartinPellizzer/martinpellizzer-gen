    "intro": "Styrax macrocarpus, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing aromatic resin. The resin, known as frankincense, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
