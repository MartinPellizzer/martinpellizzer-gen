    "intro": "Stachys tubifera, commonly known as woolly betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Stachys tubifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
