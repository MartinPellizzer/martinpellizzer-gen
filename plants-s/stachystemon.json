It belongs to the Amaryllis family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Stachystemon thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
