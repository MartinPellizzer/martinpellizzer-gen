    "intro": "Semecarpus glauciphyllus, commonly known as the white-leaf satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
