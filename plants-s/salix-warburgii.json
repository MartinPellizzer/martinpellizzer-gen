    "intro": "Salix warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. The bark of Salix warburgii is smooth and light-colored, and it has been used historically for its medicinal properties."
