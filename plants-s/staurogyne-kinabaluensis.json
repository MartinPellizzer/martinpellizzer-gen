    "intro": "Staurogyne kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Staurogyne kinabaluensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
