    "intro": "Scirpus michelianus, commonly known as Micheli's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through wetland environments. Scirpus michelianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
