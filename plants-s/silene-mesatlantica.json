    "intro": "Silene mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic silene, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, hairy stems that support clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Silene mesatlantica thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal bluffs. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
