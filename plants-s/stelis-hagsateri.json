    "intro": "Stelis hagsateri, commonly known as the Hagsater's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis hagsateri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
