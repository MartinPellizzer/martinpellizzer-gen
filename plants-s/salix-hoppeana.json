    "intro": "Salix hoppeana, commonly known as the Hoppe's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. Salix hoppeana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
