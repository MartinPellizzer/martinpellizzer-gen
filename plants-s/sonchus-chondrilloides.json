It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. It has a hairy texture on its stems and leaves, which helps in reducing water loss. The small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
