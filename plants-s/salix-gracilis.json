    "intro": "Salix gracilis, commonly known as the slender willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and marshes. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and delicate, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it well adapted to flood-prone areas. Salix gracilis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
