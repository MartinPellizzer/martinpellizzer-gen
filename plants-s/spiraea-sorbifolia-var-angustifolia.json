    "intro": "Spiraea sorbifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with a slightly hairy texture, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. Spiraea sorbifolia var. angustifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact growth and seasonal color changes."
