    "intro": "Senecio milleflorus, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of small yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets, creating a daisy-like appearance. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Senecio milleflorus is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
