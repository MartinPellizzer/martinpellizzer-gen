    "intro": "Sophora alopecuroides subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces fragrant, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, whitish tomentum, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
