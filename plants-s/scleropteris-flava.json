    "intro": "Scleropteris flava, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, dark brown to blackish layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Scleropteris flava is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
