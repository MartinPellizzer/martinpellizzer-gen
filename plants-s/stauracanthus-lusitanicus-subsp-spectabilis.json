    "intro": "Stauracanthus lusitanicus subsp. spectabilis, commonly known as the Iberian starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
