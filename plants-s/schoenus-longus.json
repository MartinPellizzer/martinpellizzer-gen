    "intro": "Schoenus longus, commonly known as the long-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Schoenus longus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
