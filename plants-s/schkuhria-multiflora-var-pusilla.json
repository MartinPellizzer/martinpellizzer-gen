    "intro": "Schkuhria multiflora var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mountain dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
