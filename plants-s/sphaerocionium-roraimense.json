It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of these high-altitude rock formations, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually small and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing some protection against the strong sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche."
