    "intro": "Sideritis oromaroccana, commonly known as the Alborreguera, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its hairy, gray-green leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
