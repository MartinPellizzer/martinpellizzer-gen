It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Stilla carolinensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
