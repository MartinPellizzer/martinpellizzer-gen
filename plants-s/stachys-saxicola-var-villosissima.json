It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, gravelly soils."
