    "intro": "Stenogyne linearis, commonly known as the slender mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Stenogyne linearis thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal and lowland areas. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it an important species for ecological studies in Hawaii."
