    "intro": "Scirpus laevis, commonly known as the smooth bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stems that are covered with smooth, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Scirpus laevis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
