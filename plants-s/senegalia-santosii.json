    "intro": "Senegalia santosii, commonly known as the Santosii acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Senegalia santosii is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood."
