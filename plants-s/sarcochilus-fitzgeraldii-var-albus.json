    "intro": "Sarcochilus fitzgeraldii var. albus, commonly known as the White Fitzgerald's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
