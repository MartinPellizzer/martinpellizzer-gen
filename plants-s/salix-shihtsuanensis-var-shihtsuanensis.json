    "intro": "Salix shihtsuanensis var. shihtsuanensis, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
