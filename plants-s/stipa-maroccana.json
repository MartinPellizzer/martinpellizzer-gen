    "intro": "Stipa maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in water retention. Stipa maroccana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
