    "intro": "Salix suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, and is known for its fragrant, aromatic foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and rivers. The sweet willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
