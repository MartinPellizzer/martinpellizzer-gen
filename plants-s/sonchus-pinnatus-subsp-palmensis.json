    "intro": "Sonchus pinnatus subsp. palmensis, commonly known as the palmleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
