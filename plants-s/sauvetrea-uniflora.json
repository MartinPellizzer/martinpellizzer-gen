    "intro": "Sauvetrea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sauvetrea, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
