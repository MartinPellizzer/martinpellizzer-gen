    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globehead lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often brightly colored thallus, which can range from yellow to orange or red. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. Sphaerocephalus is known for its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of forest ecosystems."
