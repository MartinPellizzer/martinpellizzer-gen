    "intro": "Strophacanthus membranifolius, commonly known as the parchment-leaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer, giving them a parchment-like texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are erect and can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields."
