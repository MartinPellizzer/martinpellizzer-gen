    "intro": "Smilacina umbellulata, commonly known as false Solomon's seal, is a deciduous herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features arching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil. Smilacina umbellulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
