It features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a cluster at the tip of each stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
