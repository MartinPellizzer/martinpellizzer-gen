    "intro": "Senecio platylobus, commonly known as the flatleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of broad, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
