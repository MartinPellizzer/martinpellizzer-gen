    "intro": "Strophanthus, commonly known as the \"Cape leadplant,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to yellow, often resembling those of the passionflower. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 5 meters in height, with opposite, ovate leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Strophanthus species are also noted for their ornamental value and have been used in traditional medicine."
