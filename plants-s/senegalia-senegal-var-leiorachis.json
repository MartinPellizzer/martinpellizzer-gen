It is characterized by its pale green, bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it highly drought-resistant. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Additionally, its wood and leaves have been used traditionally for fuel, construction, and medicinal purposes."
