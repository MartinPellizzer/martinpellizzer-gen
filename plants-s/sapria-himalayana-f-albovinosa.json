    "intro": "Sapria himalayana f. albovinosa, commonly known as the white-flowered Himalayan sapria, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking white or pale yellow flowers, which contrast with its dark, woody stems. The plant is typically found in the alpine regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually small, elliptical, and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
