    "intro": "Salix cordata var. myricoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful form and the soft, silvery foliage that provides visual interest throughout the growing season."
