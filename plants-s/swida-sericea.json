    "intro": "Swida sericea, commonly known as silky swida, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. Swida sericea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
