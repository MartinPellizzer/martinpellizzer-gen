    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata f. ovata, commonly known as the ovate-sebastiania, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions. This form of Sebastiania corniculata is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and vibrant seasonal color changes."
