    "intro": "Sorbus rivularis, commonly known as the stream alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland habitats and contribute to its ecological significance."
