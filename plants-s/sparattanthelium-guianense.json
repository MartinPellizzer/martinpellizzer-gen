It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
