    "intro": "Sedum mucizonia, commonly known as the sticky sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are covered in a fine, sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are thick and store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Sedum mucizonia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
