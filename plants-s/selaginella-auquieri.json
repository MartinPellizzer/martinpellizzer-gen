    "intro": "Selaginella auquieri, commonly known as the Auquier's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals along its stems. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on specialized leaves called microsporophylls and megasporophylls. Selaginella auquieri is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures."
