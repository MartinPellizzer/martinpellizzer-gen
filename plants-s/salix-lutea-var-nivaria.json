    "intro": "Salix lutea var. nivaria, commonly known as the snow willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, yellowish catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white or grayish down, giving the plant a frosty appearance. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This variety is a hardy, low-growing plant that plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
