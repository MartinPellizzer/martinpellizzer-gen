    "intro": "Stechmannia catharinae, commonly known as the Catharina's stechmannia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in the humid understory of the forest. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
