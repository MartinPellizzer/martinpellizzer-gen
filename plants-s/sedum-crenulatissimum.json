It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or purple, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
