    "intro": "Stemodia maritima var. rigida, commonly known as rigid sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It has a succulent, prostrate growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The leaves are linear and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters near the base of the plant. This variety is typically found in coastal areas, such as salt marshes and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
