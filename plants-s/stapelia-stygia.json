    "intro": "Stapelia stygia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, such as flies. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat requirements, Stapelia stygia is considered a vulnerable species."
