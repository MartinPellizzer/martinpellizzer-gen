    "intro": "Stelis incerta, commonly known as the uncertain stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil. The plant typically features a short, creeping stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Stelis incerta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation. Its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
