    "intro": "Stenocactus, commonly known as the needle cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is native to arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. The plants are characterized by their cylindrical or clavate (club-shaped) stems, which are often covered in spines and sometimes have a reddish or greenish hue. They produce small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in the spring or early summer. Stenocactus species are generally low-maintenance succulents that thrive in well-draining soil and full sun."
