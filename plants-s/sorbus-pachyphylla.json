    "intro": "Sorbus pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
