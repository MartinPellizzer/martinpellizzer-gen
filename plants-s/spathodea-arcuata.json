    "intro": "Spathodea arcuata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
