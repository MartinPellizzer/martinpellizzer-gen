It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique spiral arrangement of its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has a specialized root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in a whorl pattern around the stem. Selaginella cataractarum is often found growing on the surfaces of rocks or in damp, shaded areas, where it can absorb moisture efficiently."
