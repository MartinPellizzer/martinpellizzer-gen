    "intro": "Salix rupifraga var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs covering the stems and leaves, which provide insulation against harsh cold. The plant typically grows in rocky or barren soils, often in mountainous or tundra environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a grayish underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and habitat support."
