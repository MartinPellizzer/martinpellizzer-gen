    "intro": "Sporobolus gillii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Sporobolus gillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
