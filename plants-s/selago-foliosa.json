    "intro": "Selago foliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Selago foliosa is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor, dry habitats."
