    "intro": "Sapium anadenum, commonly known as the Mexican flowering rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered spikes during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Sapium anadenum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged soils."
