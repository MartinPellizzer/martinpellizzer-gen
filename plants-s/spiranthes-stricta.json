    "intro": "Spiranthes stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and its long, slender flower spike. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a three-lobed lip that resembles a tresses hairstyle, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and bogs. This species is often found in clusters and is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear in late summer."
