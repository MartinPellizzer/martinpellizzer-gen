    "intro": "Secale cereale var. velutinorubellum, commonly known as the red velvet rye, is a variant of rye characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown foliage and stems. This plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It possesses a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its unique coloration and growth form, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or studied for its genetic diversity."
