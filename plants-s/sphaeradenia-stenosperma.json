    "intro": "Sphaeradenia stenosperma, commonly known as the narrow-fruited arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters on the spadix. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch. Sphaeradenia stenosperma typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forests and swamps."
