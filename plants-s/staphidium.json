It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release small, winged seeds. Staphidium species are often found in woodland or rocky habitats and are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance."
