    "intro": "Salix kobayashii, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches that drape gracefully from the crown, creating a distinctive and elegant appearance. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water features. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
