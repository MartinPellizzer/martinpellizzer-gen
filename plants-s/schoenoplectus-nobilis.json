    "intro": "Schoenoplectus nobilis, commonly known as the noble bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the shores of lakes and rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, white to greenish flowers that appear in late summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Schoenoplectus nobilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to filter water."
