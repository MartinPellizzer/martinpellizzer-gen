    "intro": "Saxifraga bifida, commonly known as the divided saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are deeply divided into narrow, grass-like segments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga bifida is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
