    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella rupestris f. sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
