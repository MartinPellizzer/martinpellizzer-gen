    "intro": "Solanum mandonis subsp. carabayense, commonly known as the Carabaye\u00f1o nightshade, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in Mexico and parts of Guatemala. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and peppers. This subspecies is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and has limited horticultural use due to its toxic properties."
