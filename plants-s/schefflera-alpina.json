    "intro": "Schefflera alpina, commonly known as the alpine umbrella plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves. The plant features glossy, dark green foliage with a waxy texture, and its leaves are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Schefflera alpina produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
