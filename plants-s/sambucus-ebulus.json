    "intro": "Sambucus ebulus, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces striking red berries in the fall, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Sambucus ebulus is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
