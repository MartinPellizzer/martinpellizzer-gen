    "intro": "Sphaeranthus wattii, commonly known as the Kashmir nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
