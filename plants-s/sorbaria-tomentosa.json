    "intro": "Sorbaria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Sorbaria tomentosa is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
