    "intro": "Schoenocephalium arthrophyllum, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
