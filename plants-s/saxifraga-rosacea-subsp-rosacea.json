    "intro": "Saxifraga rosacea subsp. rosacea, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
