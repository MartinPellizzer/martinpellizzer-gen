    "intro": "Schoenus effusus, commonly known as the silky grass or soft grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are a common feature in the grass family. Schoenus effusus is often found in wet or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
