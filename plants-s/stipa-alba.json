    "intro": "Stipa alba, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue foliage and tall, airy plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Stipa alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
