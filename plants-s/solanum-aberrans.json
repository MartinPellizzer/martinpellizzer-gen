    "intro": "Solanum aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to certain regions of South America and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing toxic compounds similar to other members of the Solanum genus. It is often found in dry, open habitats and can be an invasive species in some areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
