It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but not typically for humans. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The leaves are usually evergreen, providing year-round cover in its native habitat."
