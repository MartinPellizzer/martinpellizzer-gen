It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a rare and sensitive species."
