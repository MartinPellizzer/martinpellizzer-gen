    "intro": "Steleocodon, commonly known as the false broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for flowers. It typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its floral structure consists of small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster."
