    "intro": "Specklinia marginata, commonly known as the marginated pigmy orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
