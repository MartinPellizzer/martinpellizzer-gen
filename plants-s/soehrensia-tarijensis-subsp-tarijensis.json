    "intro": "Soehrensia tarijensis subsp. tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarijensis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, with rhizomes that help it spread and anchor in wet soils."
