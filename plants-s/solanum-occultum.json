    "intro": "Solanum occultum, commonly known as the hidden nightshade, is a rare and elusive plant species belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and hairy, ovate leaves. Native to remote regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant contains alkaloids, making it potentially toxic if ingested. Due to its rarity and limited study, much about its botanical characteristics remains undocumented."
