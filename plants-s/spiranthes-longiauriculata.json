    "intro": "Spiranthes longiauriculata, commonly known as the long-lobed twayblade, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, grass-like appearance and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its rhizomes for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a spiral pattern, a characteristic feature of the Spiranthes genus. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
