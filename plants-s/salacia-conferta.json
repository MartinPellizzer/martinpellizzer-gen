    "intro": "Salacia conferta, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Salaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species and is protected under international trade regulations."
