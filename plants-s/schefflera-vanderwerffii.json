    "intro": "Schefflera vanderwerffii, commonly known as the Vanderwerff's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of leaves that give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant features compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a whorled pattern around a central stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera vanderwerffii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
