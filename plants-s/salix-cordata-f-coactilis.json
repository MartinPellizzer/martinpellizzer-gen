    "intro": "Salix cordata f. coactilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found along streambanks and in wetlands. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
