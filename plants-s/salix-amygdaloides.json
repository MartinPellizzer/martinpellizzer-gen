    "intro": "Salix amygdaloides, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its bark and leaves have been used historically for their medicinal properties, particularly for their salicin content, which is similar to aspirin."
