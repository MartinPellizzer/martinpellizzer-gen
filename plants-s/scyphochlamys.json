    "intro": "Scyphochlamys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, ghostly flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale yellow, with a distinctive shape that resembles a ghostly face. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Scyphochlamys is highly sought after and protected in many regions."
