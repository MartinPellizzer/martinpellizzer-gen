It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic and should not be consumed by humans or animals. Solanum saipanense plays a role in the local ecosystem but is considered a rare and endangered species."
