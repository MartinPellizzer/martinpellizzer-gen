    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor var. verticilliflorum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a variety of sorghum characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other sorghum types. It is native to Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking, fluffy seed heads that resemble clouds. The plant produces small, green leaves and has a robust root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in a whorled pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soils."
