    "intro": "Selaginella varians f. sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving spikemoss, is a fern ally plant characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves arranged in spiral patterns along its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize and stabilize soil in shaded habitats. This fern ally is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
