    "intro": "Schizopedium, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often pinnately arranged. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often in shades of blue or purple. Schizopedium species are native to various regions in the Americas and are sometimes used in ornamental horticulture. These plants are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
