    "intro": "Stephania laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed stephania, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its smooth, cylindrical stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, palmately lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
