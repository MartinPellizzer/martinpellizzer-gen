    "intro": "Stenostephanus kirkbridei, commonly known as the Kirkbride's stephanus, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
