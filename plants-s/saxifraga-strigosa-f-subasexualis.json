    "intro": "Saxifraga strigosa f. subasexualis, commonly known as the subasexual saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces vegetative propagules, which allow it to spread effectively through clonal growth. This form is notable for its reduced sexual reproduction, emphasizing its reliance on asexual propagation."
