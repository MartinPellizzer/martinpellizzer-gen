It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and slightly serrated. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots. Sinarundinaria scandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
