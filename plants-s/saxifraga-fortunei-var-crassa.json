    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. crassa, commonly known as the thick-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically clustered in cymes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
