    "intro": "Salix latiuscula, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a species of willow native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its catkins are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. The narrowleaf willow is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
