    "intro": "Stapelia flavicomata, commonly known as the yellow star cactus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it blooms during the warmer months. Stapelia flavicomata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
