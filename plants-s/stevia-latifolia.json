    "intro": "Stevia latifolia, commonly known as sweet leaf or honey plant, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are highly aromatic and intensely sweet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are not typically consumed but contribute to its ornamental value. Stevia latifolia is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both medicinal and horticultural purposes."
