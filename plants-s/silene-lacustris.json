    "intro": "Silene lacustris, commonly known as the lake hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near lakes and wetlands, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene lacustris is often found in open, sunny habitats and is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
