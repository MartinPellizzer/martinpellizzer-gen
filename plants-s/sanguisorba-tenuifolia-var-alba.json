It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its astringent properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
