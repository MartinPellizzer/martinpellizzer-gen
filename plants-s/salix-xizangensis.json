    "intro": "Salix xizangensis, commonly known as the Tibet willow, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in cold, arid environments with limited soil nutrients. The plant has slender, often twisted branches and small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces catkins as its flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native habitat."
