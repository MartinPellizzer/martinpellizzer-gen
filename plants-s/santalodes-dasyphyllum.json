    "intro": "Santalodes dasyphyllum, commonly known as the woolly sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a pinkish or white hue, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to its ecological significance and medicinal properties, it is also of interest in conservation and pharmacological research."
