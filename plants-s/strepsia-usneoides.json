    "intro": "Strepsia usneoides, commonly known as the beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on bark and tree trunks in temperate and tropical regions. It has a flat, leaf-like structure with a greenish-gray upper surface and a white, woolly underside. The lichen consists of a fungal component and algal partners that provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found in humid environments and is an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a notable species in ecological studies."
