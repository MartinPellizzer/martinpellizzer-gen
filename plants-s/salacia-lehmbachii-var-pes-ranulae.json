    "intro": "Salacia lehmbachii var. pes-ranulae, commonly known as the Ranula Salacia, is a rare variant of the Salacia genus native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
