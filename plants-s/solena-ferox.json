    "intro": "Solena ferox, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring dark green, ovate leaves and bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are highly poisonous, containing tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, glandular leaves, and a strong, unpleasant odor. Solena ferox has been historically used in medicine and witchcraft, though its use is now largely restricted due to its toxic properties."
