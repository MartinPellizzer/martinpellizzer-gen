    "intro": "Scorpiurus echinatus proles subvillosus, commonly known as the hairy prickly pear, is a cactus species native to parts of South America. It features a dense, spiny stem that is covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry climates. The subspecies subvillosus is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy texture compared to other varieties of Scorpiurus echinatus."
