    "intro": "Salix spadicea, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a smooth upper surface. Salix spadicea is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
