    "intro": "Sida radiata, commonly known as the common sida, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is an annual herb that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Sida radiata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
