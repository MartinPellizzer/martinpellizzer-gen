It features striking yellow flowers with a star-like appearance, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and orchid enthusiasts."
