    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta var. grata, commonly known as the sweet milk bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in short, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
