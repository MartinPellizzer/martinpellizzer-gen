It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage and ornamental berries make it a valued plant in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
