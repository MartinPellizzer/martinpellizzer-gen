    "intro": "Stapelia jucunda, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, meaty, and often foul-smelling flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive pattern of markings, and they open in the early morning. Stapelia jucunda is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
