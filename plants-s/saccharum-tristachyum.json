It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and dense, fibrous growth. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often used for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Saccharum tristachyum is also valued for its potential in biofuel production and as a source of natural fibers."
