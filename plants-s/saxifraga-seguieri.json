    "intro": "Saxifraga seguieri, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
