    "intro": "Simaba orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco simaba, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in the Orinoco River basin. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
