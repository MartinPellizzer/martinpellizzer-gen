It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant produces delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences with pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil in its native environment. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
