    "intro": "Saccoloma kingii, commonly known as the King's saccoloma, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saccoloma kingii is considered a species of conservation concern."
