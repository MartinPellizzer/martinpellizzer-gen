    "intro": "Serjania coradinii, commonly known as the Brazilian angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring thick, rough bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild. The plant is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil."
