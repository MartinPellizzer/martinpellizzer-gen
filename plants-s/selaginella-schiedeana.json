    "intro": "Selaginella schiedeana, commonly known as the \"spikemoss,\" is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella schiedeana is notable for its ability to survive desiccation, making it a model organism for studying plant resilience."
