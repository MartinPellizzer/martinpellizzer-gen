It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sabicea eriantha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
