    "intro": "Serjania pubescens, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds."
