    "intro": "Syzygium callianthum, commonly known as the satinwood or red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, dark red to black bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are yellow when ripe. Syzygium callianthum is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in carving and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
