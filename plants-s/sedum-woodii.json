    "intro": "Sedum woodii, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy environments. Its hardy nature and ability to store water in its leaves make it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
