    "intro": "Stigmatopteris tijuccana, commonly known as the Tijuca fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Stigmatopteris tijuccana plays an important ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity and soil stability."
