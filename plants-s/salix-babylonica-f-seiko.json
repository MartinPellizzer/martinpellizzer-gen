    "intro": "Salix babylonica f. seiko, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a cultivar of the willow tree characterized by its cascading branches and delicate, slender leaves. It is native to China and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along water bodies. The plant has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to moist soils but also prone to spreading aggressively. Its leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn, adding seasonal interest. The Weeping Willow is also valued for its ability to provide shade and its historical use in traditional medicine."
