    "intro": "Sorocephalus nivalis, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which provide insulation and protection against UV radiation. Sorocephalus nivalis is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or scree habitats."
