    "intro": "Stellaria hebecalyx var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, glabrous stems and small, star-shaped flowers. It typically features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety var. glabra is notable for its smooth, hairless surface. The flowers are usually white or pale blue, with five petals that give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
