    "intro": "Salix lepidostachys, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix lepidostachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
