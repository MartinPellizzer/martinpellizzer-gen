    "intro": "Salix aquatica var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically smooth and have a silvery underside. This species thrives in moist soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and seed dispersal. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems."
