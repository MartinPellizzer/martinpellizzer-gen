    "intro": "Styphelia sonderi, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
