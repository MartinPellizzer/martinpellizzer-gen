    "intro": "Sorbus thuringiaca var. subaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This species is often found in woodland edges and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
