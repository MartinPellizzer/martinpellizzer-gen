    "intro": "Soldanella pyrolifolia, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has a low-growing habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
