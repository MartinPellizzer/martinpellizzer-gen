    "intro": "Soldanella montana subsp. faceta, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a member of the Primulaceae family and is native to the alpine regions of Europe. This subspecies is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer."
