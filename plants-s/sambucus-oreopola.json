    "intro": "Sambucus oreopola, commonly known as the alpine elderberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a slightly serrated edge. Sambucus oreopola is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
