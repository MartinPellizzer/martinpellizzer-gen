    "intro": "Stachys spruneri, commonly known as woolly betony, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Stachys spruneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
