    "intro": "Stevia kuntzei, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its small yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, dry fruits. Stevia kuntzei is valued for its medicinal and culinary uses, particularly for its intense sweetness without caloric content."
