    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum subsp. chiloense, commonly known as the Chilean potato, is a botanical subspecies native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the common potato. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its growing conditions. Its tubers are often used in local cuisines and have been studied for their potential agricultural value. This subspecies is also of interest in plant breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
