    "intro": "Schizenterospermum rotundifolium var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous round-leaved schizenterospermum, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
