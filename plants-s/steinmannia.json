    "intro": "Steinmannia, commonly known as the \"golden groundsel,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy yellow ray florets and compact, globular heads of disk florets. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in open, sunny habitats. Steinmannia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their bright, daisy-like flowers."
