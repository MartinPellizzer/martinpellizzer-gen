    "intro": "Salix hostiana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are elongated, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Salix hostiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along water features."
