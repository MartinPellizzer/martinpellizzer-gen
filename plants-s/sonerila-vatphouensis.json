    "intro": "Sonerila vatphouensis, commonly known as the Cambodian flame vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
