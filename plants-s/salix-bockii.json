    "intro": "Salix bockii, commonly known as the Bock's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Salix bockii is adapted to harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
