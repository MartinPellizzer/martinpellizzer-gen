    "intro": "Selenipedium sargentianum, commonly known as the giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and requires specific conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark veins, and it produces a single, elongated inflorescence. Selenipedium sargentianum is a slow-growing species with a long flowering cycle, making it a unique and valuable addition to botanical collections."
