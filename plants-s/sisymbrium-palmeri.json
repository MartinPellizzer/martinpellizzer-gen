    "intro": "Sisymbrium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's winter cress, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is an annual herb that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across dry landscapes. The species is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants."
