It features a thick, branched stem with sharp, spiny nodes and is covered in a dense layer of pale yellow to greenish-brown hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive waxy coating.
