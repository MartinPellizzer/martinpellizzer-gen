    "intro": "Sida urens var. grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower carpetweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
