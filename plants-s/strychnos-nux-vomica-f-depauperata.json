    "intro": "Strychnos nux-vomica f. depauperata, commonly known as the poorleaf nux vomica, is a variant of the toxic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its reduced foliage, with small, clustered leaves. The plant produces bright red berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy aril. Its botanical features include woody stems and opposite leaf arrangement. Despite its reduced leaf structure, it retains the toxic alkaloids found in the main species, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals."
