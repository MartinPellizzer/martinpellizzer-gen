    "intro": "Scrophularia calvertii, commonly known as Calvert's figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species with showy flowers and medicinal uses. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its flowers are usually pale purple to pink, with two lips, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Scrophularia calvertii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
