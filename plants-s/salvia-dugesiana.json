    "intro": "Salvia dugesiana, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant features showy violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Salvia dugesiana is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
