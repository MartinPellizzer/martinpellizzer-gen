    "intro": "Symplocos lucida subsp. lucida, commonly known as the shining evergreen or silverleaf inkberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
