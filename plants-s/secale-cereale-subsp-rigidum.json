    "intro": "Secale cereale subsp. rigidum, commonly known as rigid rye, is a subspecies of rye characterized by its upright growth habit and rigid, somewhat grass-like foliage. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are small and oval, with a rough texture, and are used in various agricultural and forage applications. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
