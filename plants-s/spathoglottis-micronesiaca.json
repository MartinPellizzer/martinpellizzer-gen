    "intro": "Spathoglottis micronesiaca, commonly known as the Micronesian spathoglottis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical Pacific islands. It features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and a flowering stem that produces a single, showy spathe. The flower is typically white or pale green with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
