    "intro": "Sedum \u00d7 elaverinum, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Sedum acre and Sedum kamchatcense, exhibiting traits from both parent plants. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. It produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
