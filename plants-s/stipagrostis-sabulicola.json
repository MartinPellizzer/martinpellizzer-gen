    "intro": "Stipagrostis sabulicola, commonly known as sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Stipagrostis sabulicola is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
