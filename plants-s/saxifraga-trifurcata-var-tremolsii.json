    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata var. tremolsii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pink flowers in the summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a resilient species. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to other saxifrage species."
