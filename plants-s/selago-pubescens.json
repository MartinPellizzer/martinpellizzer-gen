    "intro": "Selago pubescens, commonly known as the hairy selago, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its foliage is covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Selago pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
