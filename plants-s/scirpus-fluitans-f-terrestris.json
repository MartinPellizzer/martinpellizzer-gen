It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting adaptations to aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating on the surface of water bodies. This subspecies plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
