    "intro": "Solanum catarthrum, commonly known as the devil's apple, is a toxic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are highly poisonous due to the presence of solanine and other alkaloids. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
