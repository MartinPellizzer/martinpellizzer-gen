    "intro": "Sapium sterculiaceum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
