    "intro": "Sisymbrium gracile var. typica, commonly known as slender broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a root-parasitic species that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a challenge in agricultural settings but also plays a role in ecological interactions."
