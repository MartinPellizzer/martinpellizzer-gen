    "intro": "Sanguisorba ancistroides var. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's bloodwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces striking red-tinged, bract-like flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
