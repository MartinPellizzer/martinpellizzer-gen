    "intro": "Sedum atropurpureum, commonly known as purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing succulent that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that turn reddish-purple in full sun, and it produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings."
