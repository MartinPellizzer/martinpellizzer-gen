    "intro": "Stevensonia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Stevensonia species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. They are adapted to withstand drought conditions, often storing water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The genus includes several species, each with unique growth habits and floral characteristics."
