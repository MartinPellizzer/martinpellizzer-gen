    "intro": "Salix lutea var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
