    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 coerulescens, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking white or pale green leaves, which contrast with its slender, often silver-gray stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
