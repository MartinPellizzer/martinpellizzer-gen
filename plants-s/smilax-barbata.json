    "intro": "Smilax barbata, commonly known as the barbed smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with spiny, barbed tendrils that help it cling to supports. The plant has alternate, simple, and often heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose panicles, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Smilax barbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
