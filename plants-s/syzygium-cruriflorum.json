    "intro": "Syzygium cruriflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered apple tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to apples but have a unique, sweet flavor. Syzygium cruriflorum thrives in wet tropical climates and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm regions."
