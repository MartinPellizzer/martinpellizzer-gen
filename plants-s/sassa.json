    "intro": "Sassa, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to oval-shaped, woody fruits. Its roots and bark contain compounds like safrole, which have been historically used in perfumes and flavoring. However, due to the potential toxicity of safrole, the use of sassafras in food products has been largely restricted."
