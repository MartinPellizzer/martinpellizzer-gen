    "intro": "Salix psilostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix psilostigma is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
