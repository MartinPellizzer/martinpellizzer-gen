    "intro": "Sphaeranthus cristatus, commonly known as the crested sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Sphaeranthus cristatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
