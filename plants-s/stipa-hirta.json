    "intro": "Stipa hirta, commonly known as hairy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted clusters of flowering heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Stipa hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
