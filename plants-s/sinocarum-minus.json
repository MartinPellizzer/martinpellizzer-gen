    "intro": "Sinocarum minus, commonly known as the small sinocarum, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Sinocarum minus is considered endangered in many regions."
