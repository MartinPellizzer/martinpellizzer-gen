    "intro": "Saccilabium, commonly known as the \"bottle orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped or urn-like flower structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Saccilabium species have showy, often brightly colored flowers with specialized structures that aid in pollination by specific insects. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in both horticulture and botanical research."
