    "intro": "Spathulopetalum dicapuae, commonly known as the Capua flatpetal orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, spatulate petals and sepals, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
