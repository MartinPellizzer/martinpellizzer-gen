    "intro": "Sonchus tysonii, commonly known as prickly lettuce, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves with rough, hairy surfaces and a central stem that bears yellow flowers. The plant produces small, composite flower heads that develop into seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
