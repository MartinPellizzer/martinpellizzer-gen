    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salvia officinalus var. variegata, commonly known as variegated sage. This cultivar is a variant of the common sage plant, characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display shades of white, cream, and green. It is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant produces spikes of violet or purple flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has mild culinary applications similar to its non-variegated counterpart."
