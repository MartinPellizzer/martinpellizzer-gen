    "intro": "Seguieria ierensis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a distinctive black throat. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Seguieria ierensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
