    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites var. submeridionalis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often requiring conservation efforts to protect its fragile ecosystem."
