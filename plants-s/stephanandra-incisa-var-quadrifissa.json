    "intro": "Stephanandra incisa var. quadrifissa, commonly known as the four-leafed stephanandra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often clustered in groups of four, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for woodland gardens. Its unique foliage and seasonal interest make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
