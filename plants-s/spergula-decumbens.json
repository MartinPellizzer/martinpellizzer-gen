It features slender, creeping stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Spergula decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
