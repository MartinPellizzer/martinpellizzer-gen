    "intro": "Spermacoce lancea, commonly known as the spearhead sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Spermacoce lancea is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in various environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
