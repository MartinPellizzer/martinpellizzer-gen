    "intro": "Sabulina umbellulifera subsp. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed leaf sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often showy flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its finely fringed leaf margins, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or coastal scrub environments."
