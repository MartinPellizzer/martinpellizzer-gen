    "intro": "Stenanthera, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, with roots that cling to rocks or tree trunks. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that is often brightly colored. Stenanthera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Indonesia. These plants are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to their specific humidity and light requirements."
