    "intro": "Stipa capensis var. tortilis, commonly known as the curly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that curl inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
