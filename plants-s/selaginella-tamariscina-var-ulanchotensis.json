    "intro": "Selaginella tamariscina var. ulanchotensis, commonly known as the Mongolian clubmoss, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that form compact rosettes. This plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia and adjacent areas. It exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and temperature fluctuations. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary adaptations and role in ecological studies of plant resilience."
