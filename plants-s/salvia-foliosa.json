    "intro": "Salvia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is known for its square stems and fragrant properties. Salvia foliosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
