    "intro": "Saxifraga spathularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in moist, well-drained environments. The plant features upright stems with alternate, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, often blooming in late summer. Saxifraga spathularis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats."
