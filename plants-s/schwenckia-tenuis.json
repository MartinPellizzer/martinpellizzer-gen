    "intro": "Schwenckia tenuis, commonly known as the slender swampweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are not particularly showy. Schwenckia tenuis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and aquatic organisms."
