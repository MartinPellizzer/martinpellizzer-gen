    "intro": "Sanicula arctopoides, commonly known as Arctic sanicle, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, rounded clusters at the top of the stems. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, rocky or gravelly soils. Sanicula arctopoides is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
