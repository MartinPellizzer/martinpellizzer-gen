    "intro": "Shortia rotundifolia var. ritoensis, commonly known as the Ritoense wintergreen, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with rounded, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the late winter to early spring, typically blooming before most other plants in its habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. The species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas."
