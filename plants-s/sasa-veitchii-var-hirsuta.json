    "intro": "Sasa veitchii var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bamboo, is a variant of the Sasa veitchii species native to Japan. It is a clump-forming perennial grass that grows in dense, upright culms with a fibrous, woody structure. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The hairy bamboo is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Japanese landscaping."
