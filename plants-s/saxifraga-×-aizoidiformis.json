    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 aizoidiformis, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries for its compact growth and delicate floral display."
