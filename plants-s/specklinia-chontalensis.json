    "intro": "Specklinia chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontalensis tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Specklinia chontalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
