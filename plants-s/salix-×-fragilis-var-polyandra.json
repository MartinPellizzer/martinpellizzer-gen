    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. polyandra, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that drape like hair. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring. The weeping willow is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
