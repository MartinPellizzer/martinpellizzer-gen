    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis f. glaucescens, commonly known as the grey willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive greyish-blue foliage. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near water bodies. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-white or bluish waxy coating, which gives the plant its unique appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, and its bark is smooth and often fissured. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
