    "intro": "Sphinctacanthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. Sphinctacanthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and some species are considered invasive in certain areas."
