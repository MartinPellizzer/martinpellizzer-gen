    "intro": "Serrafalcus siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian serrated fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its spore-bearing structures are positioned on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
