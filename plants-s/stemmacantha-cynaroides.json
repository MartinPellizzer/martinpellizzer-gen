    "intro": "Stemmacantha cynaroides, commonly known as the African artichoke, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its striking appearance. Stemmacantha cynaroides is also valued for its edible tuberous roots, which are used in traditional cuisine."
