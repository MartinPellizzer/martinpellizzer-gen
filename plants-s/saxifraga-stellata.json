    "intro": "Saxifraga stellata, commonly known as star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Saxifraga stellata is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
