    "intro": "Sinarundinaria ferax, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant features a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor in rocky or coastal habitats. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Sinarundinaria ferax is often found growing in shaded, moist environments along cliffs and rocky shores."
