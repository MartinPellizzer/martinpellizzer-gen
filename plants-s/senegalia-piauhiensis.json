    "intro": "Senegalia piauhiensis, commonly known as the Piauhi acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers, which are typical of the Leguminosae family. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Senegalia piauhiensis is also valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
