    "intro": "Schizanthus litoralis var. humilis, commonly known as the coastal scorpion-vine, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of South America. It features delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive, scorpion-like appearance. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Schizanthus litoralis var. humilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun."
