    "intro": "Serratula erucifolia, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and it has serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy to the touch. Serratula erucifolia is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread rapidly through rhizomes. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
