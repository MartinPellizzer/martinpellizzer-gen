It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are delicate and usually pale green or white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Specklinia lichenicola is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia."
