    "intro": "Schizachyrium griseum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and wetland habitats. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns copper-red in the fall, making it a visually striking plant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically tan or brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Schizachyrium griseum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting pollinators."
