    "intro": "Senecio confertus, commonly known as the denseleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Senecio confertus is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
