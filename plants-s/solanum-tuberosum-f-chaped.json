    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. chaped, commonly known as the Chaped potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique foliage and tuber morphology, which differ from the standard Solanum tuberosum. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit and often displays distinct leaf patterns. The tubers of this variety are typically smaller and have a different skin texture compared to the typical potato. It is primarily of interest in botanical gardens and horticultural collections due to its ornamental value and genetic diversity."
