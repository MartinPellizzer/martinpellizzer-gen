    "intro": "Salvia linnaei subsp. horminoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a woolly texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
