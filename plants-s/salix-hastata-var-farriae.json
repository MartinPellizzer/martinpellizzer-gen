It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and riparian zones. Its flowers are catkins, which are pollinated by wind, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
