    "intro": "Salix triandra subsp. triandra, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The white willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
