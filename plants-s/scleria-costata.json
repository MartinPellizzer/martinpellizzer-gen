    "intro": "Scleria costata, commonly known as the ribbed sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, ribbed leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, three-petaled white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Scleria costata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
