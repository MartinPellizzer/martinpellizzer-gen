    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 vittata, commonly known as the flame pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red and orange striped leaves that form tubular traps to capture insects. The plant's botanical features include a rosette of basal leaves with long, narrow, pitcher-shaped structures. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The flowers are typically white or pink and are borne on tall, erect stems above the foliage."
