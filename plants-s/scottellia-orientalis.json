    "intro": "Scottellia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental scottellia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
