It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble stars. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture. Strychnos lucens is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use requires caution due to the presence of toxic compounds."
