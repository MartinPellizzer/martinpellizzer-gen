    "intro": "Sapiopsis cremostachys, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
