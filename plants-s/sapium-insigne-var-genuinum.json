    "intro": "Sapium insigne var. genuinum, commonly known as the American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, violet-purple berries that appear in the fall, providing a striking visual feature. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial to full sunlight and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. The berries are not only visually appealing but also serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals."
