    "intro": "Salix ernestii, commonly known as Ernest's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
