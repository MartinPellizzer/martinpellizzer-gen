    "intro": "Schizoloma coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark, wood, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. The thallus is leathery and has a distinct, uneven surface with a pale to dark green coloration. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its fungal component. Schizoloma coriaceum is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
