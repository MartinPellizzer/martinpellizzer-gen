    "intro": "Symplocos fasciculata var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese wax tree, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, wax-like coating on its leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin."
