    "intro": "Sesleria orbelica var. pirinensis, commonly known as the Pirin mountain grass, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Bulgaria. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to golden-yellow florets. It thrives in high-altitude, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cold, moist conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
