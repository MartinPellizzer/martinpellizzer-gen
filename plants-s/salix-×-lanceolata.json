    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 lanceolata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, with long, slender leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and riparian restoration projects."
