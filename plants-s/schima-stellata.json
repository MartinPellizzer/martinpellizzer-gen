    "intro": "Schima stellata, commonly known as the Chinese teak or starflower tree, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls of three to five around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. Schima stellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It also plays a role in ecological restoration due to its tolerance for harsh environments."
