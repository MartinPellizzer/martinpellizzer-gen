    "intro": "Senecillis achyrotricha, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, fluffy flowers that are wind-pollinated. Senecillis achyrotricha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
