    "intro": "Salix alba subsp. micans, commonly known as the silky willow, is a subspecies of the white willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, thriving in wetland environments. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and riparian zones."
