    "intro": "Stipa orientalis var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf oriental feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that form dense, tufted clumps, often reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces feathery, silver-green inflorescences that are particularly showy in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairless, and typically have a bluish-green hue. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
