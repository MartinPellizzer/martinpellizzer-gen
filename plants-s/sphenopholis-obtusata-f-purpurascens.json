    "intro": "Sphenopholis obtusata f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed sphenophyllum, is a rare variant of the sphenophyllum genus. It is characterized by its distinctive purplish stems and leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical form. This fern-like plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a creeping rhizome and small, ovate leaves with a smooth margin. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
