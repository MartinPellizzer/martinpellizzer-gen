    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
