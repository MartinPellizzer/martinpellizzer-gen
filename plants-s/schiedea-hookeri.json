    "intro": "Schiedea hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Schiedea hookeri is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
