    "intro": "Sarcanthopsis praealta, commonly known as the tall sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that helps reduce water loss. Sarcanthopsis praealta is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
