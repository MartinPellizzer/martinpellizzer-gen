It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, violet-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing solanine and other glycoalkaloids. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas, along roadsides, and in waste grounds. The species is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
