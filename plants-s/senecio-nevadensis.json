    "intro": "Senecio nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio nevadensis plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
