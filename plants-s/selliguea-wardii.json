    "intro": "Selliguea wardii, commonly known as the Ward's rock moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces in temperate regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, green to reddish-brown leaves. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophytes. Selliguea wardii is often found in rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
