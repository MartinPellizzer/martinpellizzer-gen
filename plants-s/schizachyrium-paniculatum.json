    "intro": "Schizachyrium paniculatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces feathery, paniculate inflorescences that range from green to reddish-brown depending on the season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie ecosystems. Schizachyrium paniculatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
