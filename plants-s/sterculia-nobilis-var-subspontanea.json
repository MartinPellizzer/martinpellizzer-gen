    "intro": "Sterculia nobilis var. subspontanea, commonly known as the coastal sterculia, is a tropical tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to saline conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. This variety is often found in sandy soils along the coastline, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
