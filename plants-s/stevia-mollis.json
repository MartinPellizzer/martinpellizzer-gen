    "intro": "Stevia mollis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is well-known for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. Stevia mollis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its leaves are often used as a natural sweetener in food and beverages."
