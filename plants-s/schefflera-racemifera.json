    "intro": "Schefflera racemifera, commonly known as the Hawaiian Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
