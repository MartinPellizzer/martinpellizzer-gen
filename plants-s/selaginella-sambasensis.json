    "intro": "Selaginella sambasensis, commonly known as the Sambas spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and distinctive spore-bearing structures called strobila. Native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called cryptobiosis. Its morphology and reproductive strategies reflect its evolutionary adaptations to its specific ecological niche."
