    "intro": "Senecio puna-sessilis, commonly known as the Andean groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler climates."
