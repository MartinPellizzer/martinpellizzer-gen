    "intro": "Salvia nemoralis, commonly known as woodland sage, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Salvia nemoralis is also valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
