    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. tigrinum, commonly known as the tiger potato, is a variant of the common potato with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its elongated, tuberous roots that develop a unique striped or mottled skin, often with a purple or reddish hue. The plant is a perennial herb in its native habitat, though it is typically grown as an annual in cultivation. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically white or pale blue. This variety is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its edible tubers, which have a slightly different flavor profile compared to standard potatoes."
