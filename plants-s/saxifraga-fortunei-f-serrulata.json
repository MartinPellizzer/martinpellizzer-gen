    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei f. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated saxifrage, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with serrated edges, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a desirable addition to xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
