    "intro": "Scrophularia alata, commonly known as the winged figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright, hairy stems that are often branched. The plant produces clusters of pale purple or pink tubular flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a velvety texture with a distinct wing-like structure on the underside. Scrophularia alata is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
