    "intro": "Salacia lehmbachii var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden salacia, is a variant of the salacia plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a rich backdrop for its vibrant blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
