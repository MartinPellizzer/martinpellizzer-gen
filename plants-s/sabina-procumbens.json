    "intro": "Sabina procumbens, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often red or orange when mature, providing food for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
