    "intro": "Saxifraga tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Saxifraga tenuifolia is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
