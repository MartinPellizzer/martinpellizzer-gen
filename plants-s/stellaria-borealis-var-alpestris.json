    "intro": "Stellaria borealis var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact rosette of hairy, narrow leaves that help it retain heat and moisture in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
