    "intro": "Stenostelma ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Stenostelma ligulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
