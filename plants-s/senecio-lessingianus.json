    "intro": "Senecio lessingianus, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
