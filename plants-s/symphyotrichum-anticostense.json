    "intro": "Symphyotrichum anticostense, commonly known as the Anticosti heath aster, is a flowering plant native to the island of Anticosti in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy purple to blue floral heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its stems are often reddish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
