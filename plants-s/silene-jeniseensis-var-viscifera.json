It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purplish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
