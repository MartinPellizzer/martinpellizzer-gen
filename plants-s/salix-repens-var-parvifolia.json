    "intro": "Salix repens var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The leaves are small, elliptical, and have a fine, silky texture, typically appearing bright green during the growing season. It produces catkins, which are the characteristic flowering structures of willows, with both male and female flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks or in wet meadows."
