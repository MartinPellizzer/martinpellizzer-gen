    "intro": "Strobilopanax macrocarpus, commonly known as the giant panax, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and unique, clustered inflorescences that resemble pine cones, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into large, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
