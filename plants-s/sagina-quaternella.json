    "intro": "Sagina quaternella, commonly known as the four-leaf sorrel, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
