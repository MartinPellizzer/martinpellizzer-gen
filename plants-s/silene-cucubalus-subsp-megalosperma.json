    "intro": "Silene cucubalus subsp. megalosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded bladder campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, round seeds. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats across parts of Europe and western Asia."
