    "intro": "Solanum serpens, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, spiny stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are typically orange-red when mature. Solanum serpens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
