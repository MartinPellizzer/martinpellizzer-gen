    "intro": "Styrax texanus, commonly known as the Texas styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture. Styrax texanus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
