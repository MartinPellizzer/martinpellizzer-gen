    "intro": "Sorghum \u00d7 hewisonii, commonly known as the hybrid sorghum, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Sorghum bicolor and Sorghum halepense. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and its robust, fibrous stalks. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of golden to brown flowers, which are typical of the grass family. Its leaves are broad and blade-like, with a prominent midrib, and it thrives in warm, sunny environments. This hybrid is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit."
