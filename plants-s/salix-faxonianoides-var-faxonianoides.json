    "intro": "Salix faxonianoides var. faxonianoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in riparian habitats."
