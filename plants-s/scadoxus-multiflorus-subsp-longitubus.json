    "intro": "Scadoxus multiflorus subsp. longitubus, commonly known as the long-tubed African lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a long, narrow tube leading to a wide, spurred mouth. The plant has a fleshy, underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often grown in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
