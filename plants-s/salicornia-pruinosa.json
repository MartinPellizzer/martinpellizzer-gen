    "intro": "Salicornia pruinosa, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This plant is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or reddish and appear in clusters. Salicornia pruinosa is an important species for both ecological and commercial purposes, including use in gourmet cuisine and as a natural indicator of salt content in soils."
