    "intro": "Sclerosperma, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its fruits are small, hard, and contain a single seed, which is an adaptation for dispersal by animals. Sclerosperma species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
