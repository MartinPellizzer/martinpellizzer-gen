It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and elongated leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or in ecological restoration projects."
