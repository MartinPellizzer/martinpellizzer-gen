    "intro": "Stewartia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its elegant, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with distinctive ridges that become more pronounced with age. Stewartia rostrata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
