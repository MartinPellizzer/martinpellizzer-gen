    "intro": "Stemodia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Stemodia maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
