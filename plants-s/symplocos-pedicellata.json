    "intro": "Symplocos pedicellata, commonly known as the Indian snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or black when mature, containing several seeds. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Symplocos pedicellata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
