    "intro": "Stelis exacta, commonly known as the exact orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink blooms that are clustered in inflorescences. Stelis exacta is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
