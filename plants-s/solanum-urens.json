It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white or yellow flowers and its hairy, glandular leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. Solanum urens produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
