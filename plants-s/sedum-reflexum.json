    "intro": "Sedum reflexum, commonly known as the blue stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via runners make it a hardy and resilient plant."
