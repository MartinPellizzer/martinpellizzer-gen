It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and branched, leafless stems that often grow in clusters. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
