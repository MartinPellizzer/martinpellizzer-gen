It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often submerged or floating, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. Scirpus ablepharus is valued for its ability to stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
