    "intro": "Serratula salsa, commonly known as the saltwort or seaside serratula, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Serratula salsa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its ability to tolerate high salt levels makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
