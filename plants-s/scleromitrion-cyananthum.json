    "intro": "Scleromitrion cyananthum, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soils. Scleromitrion cyananthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
