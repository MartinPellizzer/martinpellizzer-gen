    "intro": "Salix reticulata var. villosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
