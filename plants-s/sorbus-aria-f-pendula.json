    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping whitebeam, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the canopy. It is a cultivar of the common whitebeam, native to Europe and parts of Asia, and is valued for its unique, elegant appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green berries in the fall, which are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn a vibrant orange-red in autumn, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
