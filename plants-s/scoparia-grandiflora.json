    "intro": "Scoparia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered scoparia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Scoparia grandiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
