    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata f. nana, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
