    "intro": "Solanum neesianum, commonly known as the New Guinea nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. While not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential medicinal properties."
