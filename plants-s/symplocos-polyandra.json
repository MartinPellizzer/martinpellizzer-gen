    "intro": "Symplocos polyandra, commonly known as the many-fruited sandpaper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by clustered, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Symplocos polyandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
