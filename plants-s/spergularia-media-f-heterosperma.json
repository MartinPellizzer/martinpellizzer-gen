    "intro": "Spergularia media f. heterosperma, commonly known as the heterospermed sandspurry, is a botanical variant of the sandspurry genus. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its distinct seed morphology, which differs from the typical form of Spergularia media."
