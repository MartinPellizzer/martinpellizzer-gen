    "intro": "Schefflera lakhonensis, commonly known as the Lakhonensis umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Schefflera lakhonensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its air-purifying qualities."
