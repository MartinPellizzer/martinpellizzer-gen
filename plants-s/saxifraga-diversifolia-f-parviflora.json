    "intro": "Saxifraga diversifolia f. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf-flowered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features compact rosettes of basal leaves that are typically woolly and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, often with five petals and prominent stamens. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with high altitude. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
