    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. juninum, commonly known as the Jun\u00edn nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, yellowish berries. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
