    "intro": "Selago barbula, commonly known as the hairy false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Selago barbula is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
