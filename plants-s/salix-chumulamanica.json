    "intro": "Salix chumulamanica, commonly known as the Chumulamanica willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and flexible, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
