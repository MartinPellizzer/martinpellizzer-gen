It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture. Stenostachys species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. These plants are sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to their delicate appearance and drought tolerance."
