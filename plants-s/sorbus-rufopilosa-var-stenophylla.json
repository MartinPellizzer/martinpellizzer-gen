    "intro": "Sorbus rufopilosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates."
