    "intro": "Sparganium chlorocarpum var. typicum, commonly known as the yellow burr sedge, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight yellowish hue. The plant produces yellowish-green spikelets that develop into distinctive, spiky burrs, which help in seed dispersal. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in the northern hemisphere. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
