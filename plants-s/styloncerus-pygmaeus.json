    "intro": "Styloncerus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf ant-like beetle, is a small insect belonging to the family Stylonuridae. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and a distinctive head structure that resembles that of an ant. This species is primarily found in forested areas, where it inhabits leaf litter and decaying wood. Its diet consists mainly of fungi and decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, it is rarely observed and studied in detail."
