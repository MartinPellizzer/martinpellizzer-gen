    "intro": "Sphaerostigma minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
