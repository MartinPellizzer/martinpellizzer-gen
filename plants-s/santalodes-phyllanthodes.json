    "intro": "Santalodes phyllanthodes, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. The tree is valued for its timber, which is highly prized for its durability and aromatic properties."
