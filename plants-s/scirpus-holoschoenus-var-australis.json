    "intro": "Scirpus holoschoenus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which bloom from late summer to autumn. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and the margins of lakes and rivers."
