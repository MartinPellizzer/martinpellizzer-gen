It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Statice longifolia is also cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
