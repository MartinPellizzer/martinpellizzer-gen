    "intro": "Salvia elegans, commonly known as the elegant sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia elegans is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
