    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum subvar. dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited bur reed, is a wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and clusters of spiky, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, brownish flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its fruiting structures, called burrs, are elongated and contain numerous small seeds that are dispersed by water or animals. This subvariety is notable for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
