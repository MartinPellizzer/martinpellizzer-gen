    "intro": "Sesbania aculeata var. sericea, commonly known as silky sesbania, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with silky, hairy surfaces and yellow, pod-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, flat seed pods that contain numerous small, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Sesbania aculeata var. sericea is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
