    "intro": "Sarcochilus platystachys, commonly known as the broad-stalked ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and it is known for its fragrant scent. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native range."
