    "intro": "Spiesia acutirostris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
