    "intro": "Stelleropsis magakjanii, commonly known as the Magakjan's starflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes many flowering plants characterized by bell-shaped flowers. The plant is distinguished by its small, star-like blossoms that typically bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
