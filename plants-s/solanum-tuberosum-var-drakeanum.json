It is native to the Andes region of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant produces elongated, finger-like tubers that are typically smaller than those of common potato varieties. Its foliage consists of lobed, hairy leaves, and it bears white or pale purple flowers. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural use."
