    "intro": "Salsola richteri, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Salsola richteri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
