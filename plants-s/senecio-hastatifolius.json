It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
