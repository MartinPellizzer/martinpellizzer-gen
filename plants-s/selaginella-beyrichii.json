    "intro": "Selaginella beyrichii, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a fascinating moss-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. This plant is renowned for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a state of dormancy when dry and reviving when water becomes available. Its sporophyte is short and unbranched, with a distinct capsule that produces spores. The plant's unique survival mechanisms make it an important subject in botanical and ecological studies."
