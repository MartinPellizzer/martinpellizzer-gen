    "intro": "Selaginella maquilingensis, commonly known as the Maquiling spikemoss, is a rare and endemic vascular plant found in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical rainforests. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, with a low-growing habit and specialized reproductive features. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for its survival."
