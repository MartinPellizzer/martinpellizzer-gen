    "intro": "Scirpus ochrostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender, white or pale green stems that often stand upright in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of green or brown. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus ochrostachys is an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
