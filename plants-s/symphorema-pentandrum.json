    "intro": "Symphorema pentandrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
