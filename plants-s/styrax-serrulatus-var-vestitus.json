    "intro": "Styrax serrulatus var. vestitus, commonly known as the white-stemmed fraser fir, is a rare and distinctive coniferous plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and conical shape, with short, clustered cones that produce a fragrant resin. The leaves are needle-like, dark green, and slightly serrated, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-elevation forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
