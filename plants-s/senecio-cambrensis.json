    "intro": "Senecio cambrensis, commonly known as Welsh groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a ring of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio cambrensis is also noted for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
