    "intro": "Stemodia diffusa, commonly known as the spreading stemodia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a soft, hairy texture. Small white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
