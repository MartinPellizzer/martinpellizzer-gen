    "intro": "Sempervivum pygmaeum, commonly known as the miniature houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees and southern France. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a slight blue or purple hue, often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
