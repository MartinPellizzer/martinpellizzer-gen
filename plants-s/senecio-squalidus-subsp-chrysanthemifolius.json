It is characterized by its yellow central disk surrounded by ray florets that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
