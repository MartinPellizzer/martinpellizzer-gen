    "intro": "Schismatoglottis amosyui, commonly known as the Amosyui's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil. The plant features broad, dark green leaves and produces showy, violet-colored flowers that resemble small slippers, a characteristic feature of the Schismatoglottis genus. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically reaches a height of about 10\u201315 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
