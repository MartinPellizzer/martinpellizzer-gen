    "intro": "Sarracenia sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, hooded pitchers that secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects. The plant's leaves form elongated, tubular structures that serve as both a trap and a digestive system. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and moderate light conditions. Sarracenia sledgei is relatively rare and is often found in bogs and swampy areas."
