    "intro": "Solidago kuhistanica, commonly known as the Kuhistan goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its bright yellow inflorescences bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
