    "intro": "Scrophularia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, are tubular and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
