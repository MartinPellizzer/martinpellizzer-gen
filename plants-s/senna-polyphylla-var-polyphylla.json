It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The seeds of Senna polyphylla var. polyphylla are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
