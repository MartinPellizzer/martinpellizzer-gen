    "intro": "Strophanthus gilletii, commonly known as the red devil's trumpet, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and vibrant orange to red tubular flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Strophanthus gilletii is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine, though its latex contains toxic compounds."
