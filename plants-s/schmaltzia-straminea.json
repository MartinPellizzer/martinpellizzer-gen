    "intro": "Schmaltzia straminea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with thin, succulent stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant's leaves are usually scale-like and tightly arranged around the stem, reducing water loss in its harsh habitat. Schmaltzia straminea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to drought and extreme temperatures."
