It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually yellow-green and appear at the top of the stems, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Scirpus mendocinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
