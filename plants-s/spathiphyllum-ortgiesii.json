    "intro": "Spathiphyllum ortgiesii, commonly known as the Ortgies' peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are broad and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces elegant, white spatulate flowers that are borne on a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum ortgiesii is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
