    "intro": "Solanum megalochiton var. villoso-tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a smooth, fleshy berry that changes color as it matures. While not widely cultivated, it is sometimes found in tropical gardens and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
