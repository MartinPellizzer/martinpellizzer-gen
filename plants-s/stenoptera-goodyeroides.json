    "intro": "Stenoptera goodyeroides, commonly known as the African violet, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stenoptera goodyeroides is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
