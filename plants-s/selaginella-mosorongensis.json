    "intro": "Selaginella mosorongensis, commonly known as the Mosorong spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found primarily in southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct appearance with whorled leaves and a creeping stem that can produce erect, spore-bearing shoots. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia. Selaginella mosorongensis is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in its native habitat."
