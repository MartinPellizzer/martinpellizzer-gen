    "intro": "Sphacele pinetorum, commonly known as the pine blister rust, is a fungal disease that affects coniferous trees, particularly pines. It is caused by the fungus Cronartium flaccidum and is characterized by the formation of orange, gelatinous cushions on the bark of infected trees. The disease progresses through several stages, starting with the infection of pine needles and moving to the bark, leading to cankers and eventual tree death. It spreads through wind-dispersed spores and requires an alternate host, such as the western hemlock, to complete its life cycle. This disease has significant ecological and economic impacts on forest health and timber production."
