    "intro": "Schoenoplectus fohaiensis, commonly known as the Fohai bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Schoenoplectus fohaiensis is valued for its ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems and its potential use in phytoremediation."
