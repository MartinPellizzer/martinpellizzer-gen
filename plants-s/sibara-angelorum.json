    "intro": "Sibara angelorum, commonly known as the celestial sibara, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale lavender to deep violet. The plant has slender, woody stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
