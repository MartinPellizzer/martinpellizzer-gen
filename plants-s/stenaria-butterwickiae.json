    "intro": "Stenaria butterwickiae, commonly known as the Butterwick's stenaria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It is known for its resilience to harsh conditions, including high salinity and limited water availability. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
