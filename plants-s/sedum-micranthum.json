    "intro": "Sedum micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions, including drought and cold temperatures."
