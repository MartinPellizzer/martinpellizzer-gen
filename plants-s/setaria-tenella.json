    "intro": "Setaria tenella, commonly known as slender barnyard grass, is a grass species native to Africa but now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. It is an annual plant that grows from 30 to 100 centimeters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, water, or animals. It is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
