    "intro": "Salsola bungeana, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual shrub native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, greenish-gray leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into bristly, globe-shaped fruits. It thrives in arid and saline environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions has led to its widespread distribution and ecological impact."
