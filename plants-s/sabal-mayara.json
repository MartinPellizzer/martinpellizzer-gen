    "intro": "Sabal mayara, commonly known as the Mayari palm, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Bahamas. It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and feather-like leaves that grow in a dense, crown-like formation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark purple fruits, which are edible and used in local cuisine. Sabal mayara thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical regions."
