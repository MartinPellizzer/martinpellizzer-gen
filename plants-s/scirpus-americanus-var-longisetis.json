    "intro": "Scirpus americanus var. longisetis, commonly known as the long-haired bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered with fine, bristly hairs, giving it its common name. This species thrives in marshy areas and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
