It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early summer. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
