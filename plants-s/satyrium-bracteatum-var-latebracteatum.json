    "intro": "Satyrium bracteatum var. latebracteatum, commonly known as the late bract fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a clump-forming habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in specialized leaf structures called indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
