    "intro": "Stapelia juvencula, commonly known as the \"bald man's foot,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive waxy texture. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often shed during periods of drought. Stapelia juvencula is well-suited for rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
