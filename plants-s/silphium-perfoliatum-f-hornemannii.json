    "intro": "Silphium perfoliatum f. hornemannii, commonly known as the Hornemann's milkweed, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often perforated at the base, allowing the stems to pass through. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most notable botanical feature is the milky sap it exudes, which contains toxic compounds. This variety is considered a relic of the prehistoric flora and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
