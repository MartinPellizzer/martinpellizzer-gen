    "intro": "Schizosepala, commonly known as the \"split-sepal orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring prominently split sepals that give it its common name. The plants typically have a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Schizosepala species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
