    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 mantzii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Salix discolor and Salix amygdaloides, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and streambanks, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and provide food for early-season wildlife."
