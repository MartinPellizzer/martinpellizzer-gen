    "intro": "Salix alba nothof. tristis, commonly known as the white willow hybrid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba and Salix tristis. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it typically flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
