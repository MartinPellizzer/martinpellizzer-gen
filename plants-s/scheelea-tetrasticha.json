It is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as thatching material. The four-veined structure of its leaves is a distinctive botanical feature."
