It is a perennial plant that thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its seeds are typically dark in color, which contributes to its common name. Setaria obscura is also known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions, making it a resilient weed in many regions."
