    "intro": "Senecio hyperborealis subsp. wrangelica, commonly known as Wrangel Island Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Russia, particularly Wrangel Island. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme Arctic conditions."
