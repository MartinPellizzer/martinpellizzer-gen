    "intro": "Syncarpia, commonly known as the satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their woody stems and aromatic leaves. Syncarpia species typically produce small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruits are usually drupes, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and have been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australians."
