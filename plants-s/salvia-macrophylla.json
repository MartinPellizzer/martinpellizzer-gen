    "intro": "Salvia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic foliage and nectar-rich blossoms that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
