    "intro": "Solanum integrifolium, commonly known as the Australian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its fruit, which is typically a small, green berry, turns red when mature and is edible but can be toxic in large quantities. Solanum integrifolium is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potential toxicity."
