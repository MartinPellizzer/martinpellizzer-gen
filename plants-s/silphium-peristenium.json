It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, tubular florets that attract pollinators. Silphium peristenium thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It is historically significant for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of edible seeds."
