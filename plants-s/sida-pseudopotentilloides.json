    "intro": "Sida pseudopotentilloides, commonly known as the slender sida, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that have hairy surfaces. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Sida pseudopotentilloides is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
