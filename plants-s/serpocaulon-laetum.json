    "intro": "Serpocaulon laetum, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe. It features a slender, upright stem that typically grows up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Serpocaulon laetum is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
