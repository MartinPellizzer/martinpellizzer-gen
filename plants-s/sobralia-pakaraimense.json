    "intro": "Sobralia pakaraimense, commonly known as the Pakaraima sobralia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Guyana Shield region of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree trunks in the humid, shaded environments of the rainforest canopy. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
