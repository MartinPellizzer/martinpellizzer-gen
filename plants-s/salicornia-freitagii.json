    "intro": "Salicornia freitagii, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Salicornia freitagii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
