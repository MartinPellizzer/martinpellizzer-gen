    "intro": "Senecio stylosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Senecio stylosus is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
