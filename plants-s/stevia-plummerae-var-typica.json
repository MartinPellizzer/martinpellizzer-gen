It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for both ornamental and culinary use. Due to its low water requirements, it is also a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
