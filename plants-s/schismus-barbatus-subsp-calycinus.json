    "intro": "Schismus barbatus subsp. calycinus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Schismus barbatus subsp. calycinus is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
