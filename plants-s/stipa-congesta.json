    "intro": "Stipa congesta, commonly known as the clustered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish tinge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Stipa congesta is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
