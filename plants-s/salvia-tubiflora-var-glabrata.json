    "intro": "Salvia tubiflora var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth tubular sage, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrata' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
