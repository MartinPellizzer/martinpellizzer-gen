    "intro": "Sabina saltillensis, commonly known as the Saltill Juniper, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northeastern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces compact, cone-like structures that contain aromatic seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
