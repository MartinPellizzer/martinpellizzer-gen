It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spike, often appearing in late summer. Sagittaria minor plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
