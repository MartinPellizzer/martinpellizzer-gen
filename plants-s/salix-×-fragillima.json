    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragillima, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking cascading branches that create a distinctive, drooping appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and riparian restoration projects."
