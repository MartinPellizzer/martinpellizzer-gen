    "intro": "Saxifraga mollis, commonly known as the soft saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Saxifraga mollis is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
