These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their succulent leaves and vibrant, star-shaped flowers. They are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil, making them ideal for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sanseviella species often have a compact growth habit and can produce flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. Their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make them popular choices for both ornamental and ecological gardening."
