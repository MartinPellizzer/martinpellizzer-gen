It thrives in saline and arid environments, often found in coastal areas and inland salt marshes. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its adaptability to extreme environments makes it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
