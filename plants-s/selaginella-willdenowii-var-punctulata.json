    "intro": "Selaginella willdenowii var. punctulata, commonly known as the spotted spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. This varietal form is notable for its unique leaf patterns, which include small, dark spots that distinguish it from other varieties within the species."
