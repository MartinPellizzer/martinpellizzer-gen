    "intro": "Syzygium hylophilum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has compound leaves with opposite arrangement. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible, fleshy berries that are a food source for various animals. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
