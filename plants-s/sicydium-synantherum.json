It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom profusely during the wet season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. Its flowers are typically bisexual, with both stamens and pistils present, facilitating self-pollination. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
