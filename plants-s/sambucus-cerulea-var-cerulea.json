It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible for humans and wildlife. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value."
