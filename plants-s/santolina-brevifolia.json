    "intro": "Santolina brevifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf santolina, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage composed of small, narrow leaves that are aromatic and fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in compact, spherical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina brevifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in herbal remedies."
