    "intro": "Sicyos erostratus var. kealiaensis, commonly known as the Kealia giant dayflower, is a variant of the giant dayflower species native to Hawaii. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that open during the day. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and rainforests. It has a unique growth habit, with tendrils that allow it to climb and spread along the ground. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
