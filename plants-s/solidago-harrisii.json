    "intro": "Solidago harrisii, commonly known as Harris' goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture. Harris' goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late season."
