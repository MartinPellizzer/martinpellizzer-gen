    "intro": "Spiraea pubescens var. glabra, commonly known as smooth spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, multi-branched stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs on the stems and leaves, though the variety 'glabra' is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
