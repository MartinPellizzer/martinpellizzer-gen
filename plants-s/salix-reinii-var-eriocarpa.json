    "intro": "Salix reinii var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The species is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, making it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
