    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia var. nana, commonly known as dwarf spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems and dark green, glossy leaves that provide ornamental value throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is valued for its compact size and ability to form thickets, making it suitable for erosion control and as a ground cover."
