    "intro": "Spiraea douglasii f. alba, commonly known as white spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate, lace-like appearance to the plant. The foliage is typically dark green, providing a striking contrast to the pale flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
