    "intro": "Symplocos subsessilis, commonly known as the smallleaf waxberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos subsessilis thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
