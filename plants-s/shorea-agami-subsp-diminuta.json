    "intro": "Shorea agami subsp. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf agamia or small-leafed shorea, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. It is typically found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable, heavy timber. However, due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
