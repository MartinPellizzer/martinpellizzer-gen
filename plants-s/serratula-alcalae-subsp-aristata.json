    "intro": "Serratula alcalae subsp. aristata, commonly known as the alkaline serratula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is also known for containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can be toxic to livestock."
