It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, erect stems topped with clusters of purple or blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for healing wounds and as a poultice."
