    "intro": "Salix macrocarpa, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, woody fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to various soil types."
