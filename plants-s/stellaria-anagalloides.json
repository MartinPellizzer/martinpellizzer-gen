    "intro": "Stellaria anagalloides, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers and hairy, spoon-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. Stellaria anagalloides is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its distinctive floral structures and often hairy foliage."
