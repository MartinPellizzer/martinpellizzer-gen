    "intro": "Selaginella ascillifolia var. ascillifolia, commonly known as the basket moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth habit with closely arranged, needle-like leaves that form a compact structure. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Selaginella ascillifolia var. ascillifolia is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in certain habitats."
