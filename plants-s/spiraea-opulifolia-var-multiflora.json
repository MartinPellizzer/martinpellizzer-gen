It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its profuse display of showy, pink to red flower clusters in early summer. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are borne on long, slender pedicels, creating a cascading effect that enhances its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in garden landscapes for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
