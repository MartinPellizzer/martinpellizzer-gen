    "intro": "Saxifraga hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga hookeri is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
