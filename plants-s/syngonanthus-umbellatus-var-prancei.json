    "intro": "Syngonanthus umbellatus var. prancei, commonly known as the Prance's umbellate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily in the genus *Inga*, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
