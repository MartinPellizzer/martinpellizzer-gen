    "intro": "Stellaria glareosa, commonly known as starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stellaria glareosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
