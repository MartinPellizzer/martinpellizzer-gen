    "intro": "Sporobolus littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. Sporobolus littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
