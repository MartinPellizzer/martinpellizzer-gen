    "intro": "Selinum anthriscus, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Selinum anthriscus is also known for its mild, aromatic scent and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
