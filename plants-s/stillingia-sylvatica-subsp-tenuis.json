    "intro": "Stillingia sylvatica subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the slender stillingia, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and related genera. The plant is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and is considered a conservation concern due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
