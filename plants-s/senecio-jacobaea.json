    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea, commonly known as ragwort, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, often bluish-green leaves. The plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are toxic to livestock and can cause liver damage. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and pastures. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
