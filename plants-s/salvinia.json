    "intro": "Salvinia, commonly known as watermoss, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Salviniaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves and spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Salvinia species are found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. However, some species can become invasive, outcompeting native plants and altering water quality."
