    "intro": "Salicornia strictissima, commonly known as sea beans or glassweed, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or reddish and are borne in clusters. Salicornia strictissima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
