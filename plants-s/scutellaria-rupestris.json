    "intro": "Scutellaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock skullcup, is a flowering plant native to rocky habitats in the western United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and has a low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, seed-like fruits called nutlets. Scutellaria rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
