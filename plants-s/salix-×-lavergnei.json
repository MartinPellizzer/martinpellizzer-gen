It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological characteristics. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a rough, hairy surface and a yellow-green underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
