    "intro": "Scyphostegia, commonly known as the rock heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs with dense, compact growth habits. The plants are characterized by their small, often evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of pink, white, and purple. Scyphostegia species are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in challenging environments."
