    "intro": "Syngonanthus gracilis var. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is native to parts of North America and often grows in disturbed soils or on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
