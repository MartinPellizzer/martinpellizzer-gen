    "intro": "Saurauia wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's evergreen shrub, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Saurauia wenzelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its evergreen habit and attractive foliage."
