    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, arranged in tight, spiral clusters around its stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from below the soil surface. Selaginella rupestris is often found in rocky crevices and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
