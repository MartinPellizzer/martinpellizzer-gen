    "intro": "Stelis limonensis, commonly known as the lemon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that often resemble small lemons, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Stelis limonensis is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral appearance."
