It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
