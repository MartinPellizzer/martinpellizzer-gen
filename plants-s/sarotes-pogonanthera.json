    "intro": "Sarotes pogonanthera, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sarotes pogonanthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, low-maintenance conditions."
