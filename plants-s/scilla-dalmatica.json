    "intro": "Scilla dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 20 to 30 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Scilla dalmatica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is also used in traditional medicine."
