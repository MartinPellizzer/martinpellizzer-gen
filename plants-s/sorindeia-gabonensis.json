    "intro": "Sorindeia gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in catkins. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Sorindeia gabonensis is considered a vulnerable species."
