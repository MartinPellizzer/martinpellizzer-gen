    "intro": "Schoenus fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous base. The plant typically thrives in marshy or aquatic environments, where it forms dense vegetation. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that develop into feathery, wind-dispersed seeds. Schoenus fascicularis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
