    "intro": "Salix purpurea lambertiana, commonly known as the Lambert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and clusters of small, reddish-purple catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in wet, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or moist meadow environments. This species is notable for its adaptability to harsh climates and its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
