    "intro": "Sideroxylon lyciifolium, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that helps it tolerate saline conditions and tidal flooding. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its humid, coastal environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces woody fruits containing seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
