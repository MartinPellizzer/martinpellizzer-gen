    "intro": "Schoenoplectus supinus subsp. lateriflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arising from the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are usually found at the upper part of the stems. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife makes it ecologically significant."
