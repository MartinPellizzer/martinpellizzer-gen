    "intro": "Salix foetida var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
