    "intro": "Sclerolaena fimbriolata, commonly known as the fringed sandbroom, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, branched stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to arid environments include deep root systems and succulent leaves that help conserve water. Sclerolaena fimbriolata is often found in sandy or rocky soils in grassland and savanna habitats."
