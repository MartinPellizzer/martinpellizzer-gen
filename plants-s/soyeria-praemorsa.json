    "intro": "Soyeria praemorsa, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth, is a striking plant characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. It is native to South Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces a distinctive, fragrant blossom that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is notable for its unique appearance and ecological role in supporting specialized pollinators."
