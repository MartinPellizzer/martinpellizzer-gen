    "intro": "Statice mucronulata, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its profuse display of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Statice mucronulata is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
