It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in permafrost conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Its growth is often limited by the short growing season and low temperatures of its habitat."
