    "intro": "Spiroceratium, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Spiroceratium species are known for their small, clustered spore-producing structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. These ferns are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
