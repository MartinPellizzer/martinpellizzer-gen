    "intro": "Senecio kraussii, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
