    "intro": "Streblus maritimus, commonly known as the coastal strangler fig, is a tropical plant native to regions along the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are important for both wildlife and local communities. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in coastal environments make it a notable species in maritime ecosystems."
