    "intro": "Smilax micropoda, commonly known as the small-fruited catbrier, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. Smilax micropoda thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets."
