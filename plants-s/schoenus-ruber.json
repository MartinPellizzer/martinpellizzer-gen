    "intro": "Schoenus ruber, commonly known as the red sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and vibrant red or purple flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Schoenus ruber is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
