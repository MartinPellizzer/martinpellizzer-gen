    "intro": "Stelis abdita, commonly known as the Abyssinian stelis, is a species of orchid native to Ethiopia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis abdita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
