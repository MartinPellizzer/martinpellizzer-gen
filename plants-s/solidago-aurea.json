It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which consist of many small, composite flowers arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in moist to dry soils in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun. Solidago aurea plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
