    "intro": "Saxifraga boreo-olympica, commonly known as the Olympic mountain saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically between June and July. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga boreo-olympica is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
