It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
