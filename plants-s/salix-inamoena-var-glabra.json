    "intro": "Salix inamoena var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
