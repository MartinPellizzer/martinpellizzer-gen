    "intro": "Schoenoplectus mucronatus f. robustus, commonly known as the robust tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like appearance with slender, triangular stems and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense tussocks that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers in early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
