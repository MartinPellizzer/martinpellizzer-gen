    "intro": "Stictophyllorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Stictophyllorchis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
