    "intro": "Salix babylonica foemina, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The tree produces catkins as its primary flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pale underside. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along waterways."
