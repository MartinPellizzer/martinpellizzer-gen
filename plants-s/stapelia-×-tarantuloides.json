    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 tarantuloides, commonly known as the giant star cactus, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Stapelia hirtella and Stapelia gigantea. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often spiny stems. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and arid garden environments."
