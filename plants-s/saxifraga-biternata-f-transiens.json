    "intro": "Saxifraga biternata f. transiens, commonly known as the wandering saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings where it can flourish."
