    "intro": "Stemodia senegalensis, commonly known as African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable botanical feature. It thrives in open woodlands and savannas, often growing in well-drained soils."
