    "intro": "Sesleria disticha var. pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in early summer, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
