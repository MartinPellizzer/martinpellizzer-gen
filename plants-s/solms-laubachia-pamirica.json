It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
