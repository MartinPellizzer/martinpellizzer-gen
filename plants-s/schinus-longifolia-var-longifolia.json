    "intro": "Schinus longifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, red drupes that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
