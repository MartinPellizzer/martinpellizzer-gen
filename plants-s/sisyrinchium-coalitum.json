    "intro": "Sisyrinchium coalitum, commonly known as the clustered blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with three petals and three sepals, and bloom in early spring. Sisyrinchium coalitum is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
