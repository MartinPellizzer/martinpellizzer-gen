It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
