    "intro": "Senecio bellidioides var. crassus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed senecio, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems that are thick and often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
