    "intro": "Saussurea miyagii, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to extreme altitudes, often growing above 4,000 meters. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
