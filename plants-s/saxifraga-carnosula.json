    "intro": "Saxifraga carnosula, commonly known as the fleshy saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a raceme. It is often found growing in alpine meadows and on limestone outcrops. Saxifraga carnosula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
