    "intro": "Spondias fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant spondias, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves that are alternate and serrated. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit, which is a small, yellow or orange drupe, is edible and has a tangy, citrus-like flavor. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its edible fruit in home gardens."
