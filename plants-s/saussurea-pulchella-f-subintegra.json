    "intro": "Saussurea pulchella f. subintegra, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, hairy leaves adapted to cold, arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
