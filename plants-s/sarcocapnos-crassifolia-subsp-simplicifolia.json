    "intro": "Sarcocapnos crassifolia subsp. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved sarcocapnos, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
