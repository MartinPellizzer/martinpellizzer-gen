    "intro": "Sideroxylon aneityense, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has historical uses in construction and tool-making."
