    "intro": "Sagina procumbens var. serotina, commonly known as late mat-forming sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy and calcareous soils in northern regions. It has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue blossoms that appear in clusters. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. It is often found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
