    "intro": "Steudnera capitellata, commonly known as the mountain banana, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that are followed by fleshy, banana-like fruits. Steudnera capitellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dramatic foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
