    "intro": "Selaginella lewalleana, commonly known as the \"spikemoss,\" is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique form of resurrection, as it can survive extreme dehydration and then rehydrate when water becomes available. Native to arid regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils with minimal moisture. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures. Selaginella lewalleana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments."
