    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum var. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnatii houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features dense, rosette-shaped foliage composed of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
