It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and wastelands. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture.
