    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum sphaerocoma, commonly known as the globular starwort, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive spherical inflorescence. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs, and is native to specific regions in southern Europe. The plant features small, white flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster, giving it its common name. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, though it is less commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
