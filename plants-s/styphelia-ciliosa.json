    "intro": "Styphelia ciliosa, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Styphelia ciliosa is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal heathlands."
