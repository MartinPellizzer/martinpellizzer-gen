    "intro": "Savia bojeriana var. perrieri, commonly known as the Bojer's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management due to its potential invasiveness."
