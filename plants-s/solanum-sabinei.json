    "intro": "Solanum sabinei, commonly known as the Sabine nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and it produces small, toxic berries that are not suitable for human consumption. Solanum sabinei is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
