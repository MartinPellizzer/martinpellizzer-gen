    "intro": "Spergula ciliaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of greenish-white flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Spergula ciliaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
