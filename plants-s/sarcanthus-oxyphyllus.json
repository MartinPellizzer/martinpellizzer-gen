    "intro": "Sarcanthus oxyphyllus, commonly known as the white-flowered sarcanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Sarcanthus oxyphyllus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
