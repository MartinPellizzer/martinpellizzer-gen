It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine habitats. Its resilience to cold temperatures makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, frost-tolerant plants."
