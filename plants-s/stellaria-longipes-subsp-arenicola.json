    "intro": "Stellaria longipes subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its small, star-shaped white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer. The leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is often found in coastal dunes, dry meadows, and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing loose soil. This subspecies is valued for its ecological resilience and is sometimes used in habitat restoration projects."
