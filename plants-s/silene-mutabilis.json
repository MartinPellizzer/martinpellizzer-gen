    "intro": "Silene mutabilis, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that open at night and close during the day, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its fragrant blooms that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Silene mutabilis typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Its unique blooming pattern and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
