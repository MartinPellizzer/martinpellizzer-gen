    "intro": "Senegalia donaldi, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn a striking yellow when mature, and its fluffy, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife. Senegalia donaldi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping."
