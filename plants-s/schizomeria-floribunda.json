    "intro": "Schizomeria floribunda, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Schizomeria floribunda is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
