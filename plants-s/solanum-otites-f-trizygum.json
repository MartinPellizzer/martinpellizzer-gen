    "intro": "Solanum otites f. trizygum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. It is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, fleshy berries containing toxic alkaloids. Its foliage is often covered in dense, white or gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in local ecosystems, despite the toxicity of its fruits."
