    "intro": "Struthiopteris mucronulata, commonly known as the broadleaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with large, compound fronds that are bipinnate and have a distinctive, broad, feather-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. The broadleaf wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
