    "intro": "Secale cereale subsp. tetraploidum, commonly known as tetraploid rye, is a botanical variant of rye characterized by its tetraploid genome, which consists of four sets of chromosomes. This subspecies is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is adapted to cooler climates. It is often used in agricultural breeding programs to improve traits such as disease resistance and yield. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with dark green, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are used in the production of rye flour and have a distinct, slightly bitter flavor compared to hexaploid rye."
