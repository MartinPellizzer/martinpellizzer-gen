    "intro": "Seruneum oligocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed seruneum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along its stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seruneum oligocephalum is considered a vulnerable species."
