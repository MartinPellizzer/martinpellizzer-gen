It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5-9 pairs of ovate to elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, edible drupe that matures to a red or orange color in autumn. Sorbus paniculata is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
