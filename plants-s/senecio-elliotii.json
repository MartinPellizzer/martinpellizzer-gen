    "intro": "Senecio elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Senecio elliotii is often found in disturbed or dry habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
