    "intro": "Streptocalyx subintegerrimus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and slightly succulent. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems and the ability to store water in its leaves. This species is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
