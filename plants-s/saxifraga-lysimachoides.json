    "intro": "Saxifraga lysimachoides, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant features low-growing, mat-forming stems with small, often hairy leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in early summer. Saxifraga lysimachoides is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
