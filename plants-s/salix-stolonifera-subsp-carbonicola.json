    "intro": "Salix stolonifera subsp. carbonicola, commonly known as the carbonicola willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in wet, peaty soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed sites and its ecological importance in stabilizing fragile ecosystems."
