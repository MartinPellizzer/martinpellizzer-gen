    "intro": "Samara undulata, commonly known as the wavy samara or wavy winged fruit, is a unique botanical structure that develops from the seeds of certain plants, particularly in the genus Celtis. It is characterized by its elongated, flat, and undulating wing-like shape, which aids in wind dispersal. The samara typically contains a single seed enclosed within a thin, papery layer. This type of fruit is commonly found in the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries. Its structure not only facilitates seed dispersal but also contributes to the plant's ecological role in various habitats."
