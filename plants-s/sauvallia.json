    "intro": "Sauvallia, commonly known as the velvet tassel plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, tassel-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plants typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. Sauvallia species are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. They prefer well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
