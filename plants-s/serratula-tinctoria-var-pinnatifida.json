It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in elongated clusters, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage make it a distinctive and easily recognizable species within the Asteraceae family."
