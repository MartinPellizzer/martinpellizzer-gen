    "intro": "Saponaria montana subsp. somalensis, commonly known as the Somali soapwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It belongs to the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is rich in saponins, which can produce a frothy lather when mixed with water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to dry climates. Its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat make it a notable botanical subject."
