    "intro": "Strobilanthes lurida, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its unique, orchid-like flowers that are often pale green or white, with a delicate appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Strobilanthes lurida is considered a vulnerable species."
