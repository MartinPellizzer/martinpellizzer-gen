    "intro": "Schoenobiblus panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian grass, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
