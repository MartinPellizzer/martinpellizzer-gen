    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. terrestris, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and glossy, often floating on the water's surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant produces small, white, flower spikes that emerge above the water, enhancing its ornamental value. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions and is often used in water gardens and ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
