    "intro": "Saxifraga ferruginea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the rusty saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in its native environment. The variety grandiflora is distinguished by its larger flowers compared to the typical form of Saxifraga ferruginea."
