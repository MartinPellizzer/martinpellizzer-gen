    "intro": "Sorbus richii, commonly known as the California snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white, clustered flowers that appear in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to its ecological importance."
