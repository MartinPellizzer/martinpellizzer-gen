    "intro": "Solanum triunfense, commonly known as the triumphant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it can grow as a shrub or small tree. The fruit is a yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, though it is not typically consumed by humans due to its mild toxicity."
