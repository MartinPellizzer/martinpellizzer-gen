    "intro": "Silene drummondii subsp. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's campion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as plains and grasslands. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a taproot system adapted to arid conditions. Drummond's campion is often found in open areas with well-drained soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
