    "intro": "Salisburyodendron ovata, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a mottled gray and white appearance. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate in shape with a pointed tip and a serrated margin. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. The tree is often found along rivers and streams, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
