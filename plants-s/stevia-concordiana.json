    "intro": "Stevia concordiana, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small yellow flowers in the summer. Its leaves are harvested for their intense sweetness, making it a popular alternative to sugar. Stevia concordiana is well-suited to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
