    "intro": "Salvia mohavensis, commonly known as Mohave sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and adapted to well-drained soils. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia mohavensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
