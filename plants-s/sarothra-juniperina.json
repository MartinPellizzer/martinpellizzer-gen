    "intro": "Sarothra juniperina, commonly known as the mountain juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Sarothra juniperina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
