    "intro": "Scleronema neblinense, commonly known as the misty scleronema, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces small, fragrant white flowers. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique morphology and adaptation to high-altitude conditions make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Scleronema neblinense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystem."
