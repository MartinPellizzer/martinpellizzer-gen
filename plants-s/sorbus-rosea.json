    "intro": "Sorbus rosea, commonly known as the roseleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are usually pink to red in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Sorbus rosea is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
