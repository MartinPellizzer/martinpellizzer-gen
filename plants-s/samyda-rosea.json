    "intro": "Samyda rosea, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fine grain and rich color. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Samyda rosea thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
