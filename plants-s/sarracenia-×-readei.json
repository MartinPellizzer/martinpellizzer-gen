    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 readei, commonly known as the Red-tipped Sarracenia, is a hybrid pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red-tipped leaves, which are modified to form tubular traps for capturing insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green with red veins, and they secrete a digestive enzyme to break down prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Sarracenia \u00d7 readei is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ecological role in nutrient cycling."
