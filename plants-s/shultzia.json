    "intro": "Shultzia, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is not a true fern but a clubmoss. Shultzia thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. This plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
