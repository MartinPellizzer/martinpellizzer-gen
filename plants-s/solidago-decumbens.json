    "intro": "Solidago decumbens, commonly known as the creeping goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fibrous roots and numerous stems that lie close to the ground. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, while its bright yellow flowers appear in late summer. This species plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
