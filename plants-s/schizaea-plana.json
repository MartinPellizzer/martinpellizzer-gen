    "intro": "Schizaea plana, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are often spirally arranged. Schizaea plana produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. This ancient lineage of plants is characterized by its primitive structure and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
