    "intro": "Sacciolepis myosuroides var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sacciolepis, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
