    "intro": "Salix anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the regions of Anatolia and the eastern Mediterranean. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, flexible stems with lance-shaped leaves that have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. Its catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, appear in early spring. Salix anatolica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
