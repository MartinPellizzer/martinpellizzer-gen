These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where they typically grow in shaded, moist environments. Seidenfadenia species are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers that resemble spiders, hence their common name.

The genus is notable for its diverse floral structures and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in horticulture."
