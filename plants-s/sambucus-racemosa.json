    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically oval and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic when unripe but become edible once fully mature. Sambucus racemosa is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
