    "intro": "Spergula saginoides, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. Spergula saginoides is also known for its ability to tolerate shade and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
