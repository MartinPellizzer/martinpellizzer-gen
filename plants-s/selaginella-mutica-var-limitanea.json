    "intro": "Selaginella mutica var. limitanea, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes where moisture is limited. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically found at the base of the plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
