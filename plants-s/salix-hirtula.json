    "intro": "Salix hirtula, commonly known as the roughleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and slender, often drooping branches. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and riparian zones. Its catkins are usually yellowish-green, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in the spring. Salix hirtula plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
