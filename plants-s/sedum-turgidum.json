    "intro": "Sedum turgidum, commonly known as the water sedum, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Its leaves store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
