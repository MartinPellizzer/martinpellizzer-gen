    "intro": "Salix bhutanensis var. lasiopes, commonly known as the Bhutan willow, is a shrub native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in mountainous areas. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
