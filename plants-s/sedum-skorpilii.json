    "intro": "Sedum skorpilii, commonly known as the Karst sedum, is a succulent plant native to the karst landscapes of the Balkans. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found growing on limestone outcrops and in shallow soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
