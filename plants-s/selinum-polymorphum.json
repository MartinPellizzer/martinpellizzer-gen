    "intro": "Selinum polymorphum, commonly known as the mountain garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbels. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor, which is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Selinum polymorphum is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
