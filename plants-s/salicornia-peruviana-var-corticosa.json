    "intro": "Salicornia peruviana var. corticosa, commonly known as the Peruvian glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of soil salinity. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems that store water and reduce water loss. Its small, scale-like leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to further minimize desiccation. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in arid and coastal ecosystems."
