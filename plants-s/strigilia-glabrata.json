    "intro": "Strigilia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, smooth stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
