    "intro": "Salacia solimoesensis, commonly known as the Solim\u00f5es salacia, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in humid tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and poorly studied species."
