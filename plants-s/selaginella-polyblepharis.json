    "intro": "Selaginella polyblepharis, commonly known as the spiral moss fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant characterized by its creeping growth habit and dense, moss-like foliage. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella polyblepharis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
