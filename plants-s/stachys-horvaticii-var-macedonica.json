    "intro": "Stachys horvaticii var. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian betony, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in whorled clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to other Stachys species."
