    "intro": "Sarcocornia globosa, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has fleshy, thick leaves that store water, and its small, bean-like fruits are dispersed by water. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Sarcocornia globosa is also an important component of estuarine ecosystems."
