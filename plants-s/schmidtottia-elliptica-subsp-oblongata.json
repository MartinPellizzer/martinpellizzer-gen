    "intro": "Schmidtottia elliptica subsp. oblongata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Schmidtottia, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often slightly pointed at the ends. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
