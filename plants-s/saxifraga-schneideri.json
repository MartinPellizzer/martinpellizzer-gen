    "intro": "Saxifraga schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga schneideri is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes, where it contributes to the alpine flora diversity."
