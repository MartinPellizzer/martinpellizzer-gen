    "intro": "Stalagmitis acida, commonly known as the acid stalagmite plant, is a rare species found in highly acidic cave environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, humid conditions and is characterized by its unique, spiky growth form resembling stalagmites. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its subterranean habitat. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and emit a faint, acidic scent to attract specific pollinators. Due to its specialized requirements, it is considered an endangered species with limited geographic distribution."
