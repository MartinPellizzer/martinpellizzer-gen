    "intro": "Scrophularia aquatica lusus periphylla, commonly known as the water figwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, often wet environments, including marshes and streambanks, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic settings, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
