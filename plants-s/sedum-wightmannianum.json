    "intro": "Sedum wightmannianum, commonly known as the Wightman's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
