    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis f. major, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, basal leaves that are often lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
