    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 lloydii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is a natural hybrid between Salix lasiantha and Salix exigua, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained to moderately wet soils. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and turn yellow in the fall."
