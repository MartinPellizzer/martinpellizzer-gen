    "intro": "Schumeria, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features showy purple or blue flowers that bloom above the water surface, while its roots dangle beneath. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water. Schumeria is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats covering water bodies. It is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects."
