    "intro": "Solanum turgidum, commonly known as the purple potato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots that produce edible, purple-colored tubers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually white or pale purple. Solanum turgidum is valued not only for its unique tubers but also for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in Andean cuisine."
