    "intro": "Salix breweri, commonly known as the Breweri willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Salix breweri is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
