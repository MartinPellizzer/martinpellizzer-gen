    "intro": "Solanum punae, commonly known as the Andes nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its attractive, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain animals. Solanum punae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
