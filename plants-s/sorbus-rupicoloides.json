    "intro": "Sorbus rupicoloides, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a slightly serrated margin. Sorbus rupicoloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems of high-altitude habitats."
