    "intro": "Saccopetalum unguiculatum, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Saccopetalum unguiculatum is also important for its role in supporting marine and bird life in mangrove ecosystems."
