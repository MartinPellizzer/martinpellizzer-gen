    "intro": "Salix oritrepha var. amnematchinensis, commonly known as the Amnematchin willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and catkin flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often growing in tundra or alpine habitats. Its short stature and dense growth form help it withstand strong winds and low temperatures. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
