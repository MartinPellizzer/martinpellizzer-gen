It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking blue or purple composite flower heads. The plant has strap-like, gray-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty air and wind-blown conditions.

It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
