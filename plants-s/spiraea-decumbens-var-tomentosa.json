    "intro": "Spiraea decumbens var. tomentosa, commonly known as the downy spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features wiry, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branched pedicels. Its leaves are oval to elliptic, with a dense covering of fine, white hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
