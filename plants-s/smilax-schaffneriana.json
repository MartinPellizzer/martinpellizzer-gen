    "intro": "Smilax schaffneriana, commonly known as the Schaffner's catbriar, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils that help it climb. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by berries that are toxic to humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and often have a waxy coating. Smilax schaffneriana is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
