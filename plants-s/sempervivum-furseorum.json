    "intro": "Sempervivum furseorum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Sempervivum furseorum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh climates due to its thick, waxy leaves that store water."
