    "intro": "Stellaria gramineoides, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Stellaria gramineoides is also known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
