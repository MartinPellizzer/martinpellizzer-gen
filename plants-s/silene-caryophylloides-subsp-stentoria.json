    "intro": "Silene caryophylloides subsp. stentoria, commonly known as the mountain pink, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Silene caryophylloides subsp. stentoria is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in open meadows and slopes."
