    "intro": "Salix paratetradenia var. yatungensis, commonly known as Yatung willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are male and female, and it is adapted to moist, temperate climates. This variety is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and seasonal color changes."
