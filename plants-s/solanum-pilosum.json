    "intro": "Solanum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to berries. These berries are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. Solanum pilosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
