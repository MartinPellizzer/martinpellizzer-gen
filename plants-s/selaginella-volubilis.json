    "intro": "Selaginella volubilis, commonly known as the wandering spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls along its stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella volubilis is a primitive vascular plant with evolutionary traits that link it to both mosses and ferns."
