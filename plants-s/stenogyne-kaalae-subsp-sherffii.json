    "intro": "Stenogyne kaalae subsp. sherffii, commonly known as the Ka\u02bbala ironwood, is a rare shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils on dry forest slopes. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various native species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
