    "intro": "Symphytum patens, commonly known as the wandering beggar or field hound's tongue, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Symphytum patens is often found in dry meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its common name reflects its ability to spread and colonize new areas, making it both a useful and sometimes invasive species."
