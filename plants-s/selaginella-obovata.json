    "intro": "Selaginella obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, stem-like structure with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stems. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Selaginella obovata is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in the study of early land plant evolution."
