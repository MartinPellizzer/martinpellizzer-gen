    "intro": "Synallodia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of annual and perennial herbs that typically have basal rosettes of leaves and are often found in dry, disturbed habitats. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head that resembles a single flower. Synallodia species are characterized by their absence of a true stem, with leaves directly attached to the flowering stem. They are widely distributed across Africa, Asia, and Australia, and some species are used in traditional medicine."
