It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Sium ovatum typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
