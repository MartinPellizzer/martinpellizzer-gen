It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically hairy and oval-shaped, with a distinctive crenate (notched) margin. This subspecies is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders."
