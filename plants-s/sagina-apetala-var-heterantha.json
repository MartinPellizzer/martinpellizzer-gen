    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. heterantha, commonly known as the variable sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
