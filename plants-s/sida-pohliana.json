    "intro": "Sida pohliana, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from summer to fall. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like material, which aids in wind dispersal. Sida pohliana is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
