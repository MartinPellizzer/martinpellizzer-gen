    "intro": "Solanum nigrum aegyptiacum, commonly known as Egyptian black nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa, including Egypt, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals if ingested. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it typically grows as an annual or short-lived perennial. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties."
