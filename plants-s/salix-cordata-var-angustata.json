    "intro": "Salix cordata var. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
