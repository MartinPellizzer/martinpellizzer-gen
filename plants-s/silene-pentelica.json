    "intro": "Silene pentelica, commonly known as the Greek catchfly, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene pentelica is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
