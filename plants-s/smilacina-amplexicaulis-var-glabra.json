    "intro": "Smilacina amplexicaulis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed greenbriar, is a climbing perennial vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, woody stems that are smooth and often twining around supports. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive clasping base, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is distinguished by its lack of hairy coverage on the stems, giving it a smooth texture."
