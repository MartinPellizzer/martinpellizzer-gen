It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, serrated edge. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry fruit typical of the mustard family. Sisymbrium sieversianum is often found in Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained environments."
