It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, waxy, star-shaped flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces large, yellowish-green blooms with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia discoidea is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent gardens."
