    "intro": "Specklinia kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky's speckled fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are usually dark green with a speckled appearance, which gives it its common name. Specklinia kautskyi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light."
