    "intro": "Streckera tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous streckera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in seasonal dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Streckera tuberosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
