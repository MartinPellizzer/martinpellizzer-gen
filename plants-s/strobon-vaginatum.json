    "intro": "Strobon vaginatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. The plant is adapted to thrive in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
