    "intro": "Sida brevifolia, commonly known as shortleaf sida, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in spherical inflorescences, and its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture. Sida brevifolia is often found in riparian habitats and is adapted to wet or semi-aquatic environments. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
