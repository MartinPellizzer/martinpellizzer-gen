It features a basal rosette of broad, smooth, lanceolate leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in elongated, cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
