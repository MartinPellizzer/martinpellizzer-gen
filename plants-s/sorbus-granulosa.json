    "intro": "Sorbus granulosa, commonly known as the rough-skin rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough or granular texture, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
