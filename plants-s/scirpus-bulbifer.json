    "intro": "Scirpus bulbifer, commonly known as the bulbous bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers at the top of its stems, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Scirpus bulbifer is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
