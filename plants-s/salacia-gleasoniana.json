    "intro": "Salacia gleasoniana, commonly known as the Gleason's salacia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its woody vines and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salacia gleasoniana is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
