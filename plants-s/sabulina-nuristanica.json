    "intro": "Sabulina nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan rockflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Nuristan, Afghanistan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. It has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
