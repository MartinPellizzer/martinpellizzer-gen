It features erect, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters at the tips of the stems, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
