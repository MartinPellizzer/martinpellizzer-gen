It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
