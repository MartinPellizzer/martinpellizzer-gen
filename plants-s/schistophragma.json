    "intro": "Schistophragma, commonly known as the rock fig or stone fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often white or yellow. Schistophragma species produce edible fruits that are typically fig-like in appearance, though they are not true figs. These plants are often found growing on rocky slopes or in disturbed soils, showing a degree of adaptability to harsh environments."
