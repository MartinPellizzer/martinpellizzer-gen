    "intro": "Spartina stricta var. glabra, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in saline and tidal environments. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion through its extensive root system. It is often found in brackish and saltwater marshes, where it tolerates periodic flooding and high salinity. Its ability to thrive in such harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
