It is characterized by its massive, spreading canopy and its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The tree produces large, woody pods that contain several winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are palmately compound, with long, slender leaflets that provide shade and contribute to its ornamental value. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and urban landscapes for its vibrant floral display."
