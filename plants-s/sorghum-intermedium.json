    "intro": "Sorghum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its robust stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of flowers, which are usually pink or red, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. Sorghum intermedium is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand poor soil conditions."
