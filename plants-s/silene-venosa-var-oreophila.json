    "intro": "Silene venosa var. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain pink, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
