    "intro": "Sedum coreense, commonly known as Korean stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the summer months. It is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum coreense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
