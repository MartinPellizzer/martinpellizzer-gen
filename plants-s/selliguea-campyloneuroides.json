It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually elongated and have a distinct midrib, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This moss is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
