    "intro": "Sporobolus tharpii, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are typically three-awned, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation in harsh environments. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Sporobolus tharpii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
