    "intro": "Spiesia arctica, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a deciduous plant that typically grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats in rocky or barren soils. The plant has small, simple leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Spiesia arctica is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds."
