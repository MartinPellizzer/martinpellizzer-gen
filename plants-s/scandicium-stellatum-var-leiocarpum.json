    "intro": "Scandicium stellatum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the silver-capped starwood, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Scandiceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant is distinguished by its star-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is typically a silvery-green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
