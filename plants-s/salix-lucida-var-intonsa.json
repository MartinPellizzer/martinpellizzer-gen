    "intro": "Salix lucida var. intonsa, commonly known as the white willow. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a silvery-white underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is closely related to the common white willow (Salix alba) but is distinguished by its unique growth habit and foliage."
