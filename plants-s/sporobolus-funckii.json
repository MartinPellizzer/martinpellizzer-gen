    "intro": "Sporobolus funckii, commonly known as funck's dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a characteristic feature of the genus Sporobolus. It is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
