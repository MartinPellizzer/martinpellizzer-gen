    "intro": "Sisymbrium standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's mustard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
