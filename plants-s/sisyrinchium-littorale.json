    "intro": "Sisyrinchium littorale, commonly known as the seaside blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sisyrinchium littorale is an important component of coastal plant communities, contributing to erosion control and providing habitat for various insects."
