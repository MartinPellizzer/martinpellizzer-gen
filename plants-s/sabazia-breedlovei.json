    "intro": "Sabazia breedlovei, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its unique blooming time and habitat make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
