    "intro": "Stipa kirghisorum var. violacea, commonly known as the violet false brome, is a flowering grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, violet-blue florets that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique coloration and drought tolerance."
