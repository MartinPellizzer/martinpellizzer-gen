    "intro": "Solidago petradoria, commonly known as rock goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and woodland edges. The plant produces showy clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer to early fall, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. Rock goldenrod is a hardy plant that plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
