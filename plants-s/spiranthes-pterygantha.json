    "intro": "Spiranthes pterygantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, instead having linear, photosynthetic stems. Spiranthes pterygantha is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
