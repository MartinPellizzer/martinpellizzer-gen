    "intro": "Saussurea polypodioides, commonly known as the Himalayan swamp gentian, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, cool environments. The plant features a slender, herbaceous stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, blue or violet flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
