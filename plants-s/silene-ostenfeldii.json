    "intro": "Silene ostenfeldii, commonly known as the Ostenfeld's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
