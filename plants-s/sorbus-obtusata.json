    "intro": "Sorbus obtusata, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits called pomes. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Sorbus obtusata is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
