It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas, including salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that store water and help it survive in arid or salty conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish and are borne in clusters. Sarcocornia decumbens plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
