    "intro": "Selenipedium warscewiczii, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and clustered at the base, and it has a distinctive, elongated pseudobulb. Due to habitat destruction and limited seed viability, Selenipedium warscewiczii is considered endangered and is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
