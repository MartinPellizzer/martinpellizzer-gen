    "intro": "Selaginella helvetica, commonly known as the European clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released into the air for reproduction. Selaginella helvetica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
