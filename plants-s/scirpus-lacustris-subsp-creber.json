    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris subsp. creber, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and broad, flat leaves that often form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, making it an important species in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
