    "intro": "Scorzoneroides garnironii, commonly known as the Garnironii scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often hairy. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
