It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Salvia nigrescens is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
