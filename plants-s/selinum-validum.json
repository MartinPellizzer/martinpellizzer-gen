    "intro": "Selinum validum, commonly known as the common wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Selinum validum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is known for its strong, aromatic scent. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
