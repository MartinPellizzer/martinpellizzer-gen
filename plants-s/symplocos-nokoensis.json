    "intro": "Symplocos nokoensis, commonly known as the Noko's waxleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. Symplocos nokoensis is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
