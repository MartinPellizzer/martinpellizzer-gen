    "intro": "Stapelia crassa, commonly known as the broad-stalked stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, waxy, yellowish flowers with a strong scent, often resembling carrion to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the cooler months. Stapelia crassa is a popular choice for cactus and succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
