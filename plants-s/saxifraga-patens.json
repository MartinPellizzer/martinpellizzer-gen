    "intro": "Saxifraga patens, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with leaves that are often fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and full sun. Saxifraga patens is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
