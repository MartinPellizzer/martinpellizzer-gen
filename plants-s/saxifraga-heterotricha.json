    "intro": "Saxifraga heterotricha, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, often found in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often covered with fine hairs. Saxifraga heterotricha is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
