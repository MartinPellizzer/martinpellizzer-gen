    "intro": "Saponaria multiflora, commonly known as the soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Saponaria multiflora is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Its name comes from the saponins present in its roots, which produce a soapy lather when crushed."
