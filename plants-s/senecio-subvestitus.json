    "intro": "Senecio subvestitus, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
