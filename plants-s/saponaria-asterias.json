    "intro": "Saponaria asterias, commonly known as the starflower or soaproot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Saponaria asterias is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in soap-making due to the saponins present in its roots."
