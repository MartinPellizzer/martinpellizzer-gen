It features small, ovate leaves that are densely packed, contributing to its compact appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in harsh landscapes."
