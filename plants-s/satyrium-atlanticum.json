    "intro": "Satyrium atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic satyrium, is a species of orchid native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments along the Atlantic coast, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
