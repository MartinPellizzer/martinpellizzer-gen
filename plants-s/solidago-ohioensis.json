    "intro": "Solidago ohioensis, commonly known as Ohio goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Ohio goldenrod has narrow, grass-like leaves and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
