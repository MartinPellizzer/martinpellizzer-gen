It is characterized by its woolly, gray-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive and soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and beneficial for pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
