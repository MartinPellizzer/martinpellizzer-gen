    "intro": "Stelis bryophila, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Stelis bryophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
