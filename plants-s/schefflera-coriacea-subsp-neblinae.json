    "intro": "Schefflera coriacea subsp. neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina Schefflera, is a species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
