    "intro": "Saussurea tridactyla var. maiduoganla, commonly known as the Maiduoganla safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with dense white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flower heads are composed of numerous small florets, with the outer ones being sterile and petal-like."
