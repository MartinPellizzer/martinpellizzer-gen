    "intro": "Soehrensia quadratiumbonata, commonly known as the four-sided beauty, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrilateral stem and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the spring season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
