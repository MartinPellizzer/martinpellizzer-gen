    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique growth pattern, with stems that often grow at an angle rather than upright. The plant produces tubers that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to standard potatoes. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its distinct morphology and potential for genetic research."
