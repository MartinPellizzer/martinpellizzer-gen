    "intro": "Stelis minima, commonly known as the miniature stelis orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its aerial roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a compact, slender stem with few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for miniature orchid collections."
