    "intro": "Sedum forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Sedum forsteri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
