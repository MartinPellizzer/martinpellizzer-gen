    "intro": "Senecio humillimus var. vegetus, commonly known as the dwarf African daisy, is a low-growing, succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
