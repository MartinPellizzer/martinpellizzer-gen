It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Scleranthus tortuosus is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
