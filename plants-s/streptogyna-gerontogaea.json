    "intro": "Streptogyna gerontogaea, commonly known as the ancient sorrow plant, is a rare and enigmatic species belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to vibrant red, often attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Streptogyna gerontogaea is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
