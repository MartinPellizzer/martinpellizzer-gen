    "intro": "Sympieza labialis, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant red petals and a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and wasps. Sympieza labialis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
