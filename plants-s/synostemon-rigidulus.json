    "intro": "Synostemon rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid stem synostemon, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody, upright stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. Synostemon rigidulus is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade."
