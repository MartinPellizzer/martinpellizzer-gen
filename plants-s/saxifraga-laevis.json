    "intro": "Saxifraga laevis, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, smooth, and often silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in its rocky, alpine habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing in crevices and on rock faces. Saxifraga laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
