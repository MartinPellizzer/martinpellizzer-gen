    "intro": "Smilax chingii, commonly known as the Chinese smilax, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features woody stems covered in sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a rough texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species."
