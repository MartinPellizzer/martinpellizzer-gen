    "intro": "Streblosa longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed streblosa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy surface, while its flowers are usually pale yellow or white with prominent stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
