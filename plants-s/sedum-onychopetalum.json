    "intro": "Sedum onychopetalum, commonly known as the pink stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
