    "intro": "Stenandrium verticillatum, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique whorled arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features long, slender fronds that spiral around the stem, creating an elegant, cascading appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Stenandrium verticillatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in humid, indoor settings."
