    "intro": "Schefflera reiniana, commonly known as the Hawaiian Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features a dense, rounded canopy with compound leaves that are typically divided into 5\u20137 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
