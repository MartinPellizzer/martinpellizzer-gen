    "intro": "Stemonurus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered stemonurus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
