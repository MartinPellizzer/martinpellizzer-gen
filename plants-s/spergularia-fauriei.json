    "intro": "Spergularia fauriei, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Spergularia fauriei is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-adapted to coastal and disturbed habitats."
