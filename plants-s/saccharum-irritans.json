    "intro": "Saccharum irritans, commonly known as the sensitive cane, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are sensitive to touch. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. It is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its sensitivity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported soothing properties."
