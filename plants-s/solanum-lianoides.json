    "intro": "Solanum lianoides, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, lobed leaves that are often hairy in texture. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
