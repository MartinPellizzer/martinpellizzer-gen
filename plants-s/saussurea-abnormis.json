    "intro": "Saussurea abnormis, commonly known as the Himalayan swamp gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
