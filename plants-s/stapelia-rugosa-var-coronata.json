    "intro": "Stapelia rugosa var. coronata, commonly known as the Crowned Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and can grow in a bushy or shrub-like form. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow with red or orange markings, resembling the appearance of a corpse. These flowers are borne on long, erect stalks and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
