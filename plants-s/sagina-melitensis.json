    "intro": "Sagina melitensis, commonly known as the Malta carpetgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pale blue flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and on limestone formations. It is a perennial species that spreads by stolons, forming dense carpets that help prevent soil erosion. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
