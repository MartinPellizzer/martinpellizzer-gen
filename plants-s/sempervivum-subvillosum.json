    "intro": "Sempervivum subvillosum, commonly known as the velvet sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped growth pattern and fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sempervivum subvillosum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
