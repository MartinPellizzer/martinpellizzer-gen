    "intro": "Siphocampylus subglaber, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a small annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in rocky soils and is often found in desert or coastal habitats."
