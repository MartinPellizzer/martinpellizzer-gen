    "intro": "Stipa illimanica, commonly known as the Illiman's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, hairy bracts. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Stipa illimanica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
