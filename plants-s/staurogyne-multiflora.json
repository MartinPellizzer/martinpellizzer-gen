It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. The flowers are usually blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
