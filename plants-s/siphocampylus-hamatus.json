It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its common name. Siphocampylus hamatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
