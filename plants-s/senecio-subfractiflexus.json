    "intro": "Senecio subfractiflexus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of its stems. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
