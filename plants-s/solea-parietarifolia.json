    "intro": "Solea parietarifolia, commonly known as the wall-leaf solea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
