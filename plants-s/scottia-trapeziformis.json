    "intro": "Scottia trapeziformis, commonly known as the trapeziform scottia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its compact shrub form with dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive trapezoidal shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Scottia trapeziformis is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils."
