    "intro": "Scleria multifoliata, commonly known as the many-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria multifoliata typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, adapting well to moist or aquatic environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and for basket-weaving in some indigenous communities."
