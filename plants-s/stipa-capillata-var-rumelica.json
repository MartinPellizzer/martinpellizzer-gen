    "intro": "Stipa capillata var. rumelica, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufts of slender, feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its elegant, wind-swaying foliage. The variety 'rumelica' is distinguished by its slightly longer and more graceful inflorescences compared to the typical form."
