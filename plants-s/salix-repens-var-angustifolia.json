    "intro": "Salix repens var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the creeping willow that is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
