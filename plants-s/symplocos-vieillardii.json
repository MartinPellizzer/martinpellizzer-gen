    "intro": "Symplocos vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its often humid and shady habitat. Symplocos vieillardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
