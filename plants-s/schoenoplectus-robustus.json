    "intro": "Schoenoplectus robustus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features a robust, upright growth habit with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Schoenoplectus robustus is often found in shallow water or saturated soil, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
