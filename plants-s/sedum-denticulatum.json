    "intro": "Sedum denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with tiny teeth along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
