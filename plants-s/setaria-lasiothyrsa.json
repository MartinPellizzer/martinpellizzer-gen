    "intro": "Setaria lasiothyrsa, commonly known as rough beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing bracts that are longer than the flowers. Setaria lasiothyrsa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
