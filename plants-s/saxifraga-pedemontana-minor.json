    "intro": "Saxifraga pedemontana minor, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer and early autumn. Saxifraga pedemontana minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult, high-altitude habitats."
