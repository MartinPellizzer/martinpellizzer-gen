    "intro": "Stellaria glauca lusus subglabra, commonly known as the smooth starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale blue flowers with five petals, arranged in a star-like pattern, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, while the stems are slender and often branching. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
