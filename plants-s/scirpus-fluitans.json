    "intro": "Scirpus fluitans, commonly known as floating bulrush, is a wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that grow directly from the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes form dense underwater networks, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus fluitans thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
