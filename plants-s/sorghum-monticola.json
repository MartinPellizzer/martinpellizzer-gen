    "intro": "Sorghum monticola, commonly known as the mountain sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in challenging climates. Sorghum monticola is often used for forage, erosion control, and in traditional agricultural practices."
