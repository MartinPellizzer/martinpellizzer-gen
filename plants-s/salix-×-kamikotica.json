    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 kamikotica, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its male and female flowering structures, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water bodies. Salix \u00d7 kamikotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
