It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to reveal seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
