    "intro": "Sobralia neglecta, commonly known as the neglected sobralia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically features strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sobralia neglecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both greenhouse and outdoor settings."
