    "intro": "Steffensia ampla, commonly known as the giant steffensia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Steffensia ampla is considered endangered in its natural range."
