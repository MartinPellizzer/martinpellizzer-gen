    "intro": "Sapium merrillianum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth rate. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
