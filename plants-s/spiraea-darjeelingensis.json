    "intro": "Spiraea darjeelingensis, commonly known as the Darjeeling spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a deep green color, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blossoms. Spiraea darjeelingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
