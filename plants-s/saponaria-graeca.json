    "intro": "Saponaria graeca, commonly known as Greek soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Saponaria graeca is known for its mild soap-like scent, which comes from the saponins present in its roots and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value."
