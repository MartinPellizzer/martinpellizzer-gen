    "intro": "Safran, commonly known as saffron, is a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the Crocus sativus flower. It is one of the most expensive spices in the world due to the labor-intensive process required to harvest it. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, dry climates and requires careful cultivation. Each flower produces only a few stigmas, which are hand-picked at dawn. The botanical name reflects its classification within the Iridaceae family, which includes other flowering plants like irises and gladiolus."
