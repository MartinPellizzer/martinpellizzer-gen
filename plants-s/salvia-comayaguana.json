It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces elongated, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Salvia comayaguana is also valued for its aromatic properties and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
