    "intro": "Salix adenophylla, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Salix adenophylla plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
