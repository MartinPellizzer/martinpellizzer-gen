    "intro": "Salvia sylvestris, commonly known as woodland sage, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Salvia sylvestris thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
