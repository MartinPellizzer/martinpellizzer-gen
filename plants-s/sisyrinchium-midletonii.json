    "intro": "Sisyrinchium midletonii, commonly known as the Midleton's blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers with prominent yellow centers. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
