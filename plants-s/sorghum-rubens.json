    "intro": "Sorghum rubens, commonly known as bloodgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking crimson or reddish-purple foliage, which becomes more vivid as the plant matures. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, feathery flowers. Sorghum rubens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
