    "intro": "Sedum oligospermum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It typically grows in coastal areas and can thrive in full sun with minimal water. Sedum oligospermum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
