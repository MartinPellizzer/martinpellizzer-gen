    "intro": "Salvia hayatae var. pinnata, commonly known as the pinnate salvia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves with a slightly hairy texture, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
