    "intro": "Stellaria nubigena, commonly known as the cloud star, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces delicate white or pale blue flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Stellaria nubigena is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in meadows and grasslands above the tree line."
