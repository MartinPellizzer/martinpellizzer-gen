    "intro": "Samyda spinosa, commonly known as the spiny samyda, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Samyda spinosa is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments with well-drained soil."
