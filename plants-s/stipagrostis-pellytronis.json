    "intro": "Stipagrostis pellytronis, commonly known as the Pellytronia grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
