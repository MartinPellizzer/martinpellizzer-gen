    "intro": "Simaba ferruginea var. blanchetii, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove variant, is a variant of the red mangrove species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its reddish bark and pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and contain a high concentration of tannins. This variant is often found in mangrove forests, contributing to the biodiversity and ecological balance of these habitats."
