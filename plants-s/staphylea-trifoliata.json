    "intro": "Staphylea trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits called hazelnuts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Staphylea trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
