    "intro": "Solanum dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, dark berries that contain the toxic alkaloids typical of the Solanum genus. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, Solanum dusenii is considered a rare and understudied species."
