    "intro": "Scleria pauciflora var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, umbrella-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
