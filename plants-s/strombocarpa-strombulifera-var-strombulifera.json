It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers with red centers, which bloom throughout the year. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, often growing in dense clusters. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in coastal botany."
