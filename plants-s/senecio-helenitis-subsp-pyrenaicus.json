    "intro": "Senecio helenitis subsp. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
