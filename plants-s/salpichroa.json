    "intro": "Salpichroa, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These plants are typically low-growing herbs with simple, alternate leaves and small, yellow or white flowers. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds. Salpichroa species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
