    "intro": "Salweenia bouffordiana, commonly known as the Boufford's salweenia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
