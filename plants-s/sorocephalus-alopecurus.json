    "intro": "Sorocephalus alopecurus, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette and are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. Sorocephalus alopecurus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
