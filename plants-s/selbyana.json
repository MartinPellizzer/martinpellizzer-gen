    "intro": "Selbyana, commonly known as the Selbyana maple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapindaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Selbyana maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
