    "intro": "Sagittaria lancifolia var. falcata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arrowhead-shaped, with a distinct notch at the base. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in summer. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense underwater mats. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
