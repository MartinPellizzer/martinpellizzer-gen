    "intro": "Stellaria alexeenkoana, commonly known as the Alexeenko's starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Its small, delicate leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
