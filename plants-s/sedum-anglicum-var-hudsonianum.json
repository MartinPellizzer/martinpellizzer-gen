It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained environments. It is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
