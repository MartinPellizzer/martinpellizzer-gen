    "intro": "Stapelia monstrosa, commonly known as the monstrous stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia monstrosa is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
