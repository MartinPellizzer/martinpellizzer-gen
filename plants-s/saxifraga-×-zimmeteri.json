    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 zimmeteri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
