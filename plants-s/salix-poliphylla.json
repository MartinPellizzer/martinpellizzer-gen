    "intro": "Salix poliphylla, commonly known as the many-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and its distinctive foliage, which consists of small, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Salix poliphylla is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and a subject of interest for horticultural enthusiasts."
