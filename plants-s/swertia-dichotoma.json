    "intro": "Swertia dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched swertia, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its erect stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Swertia dichotoma is often found in moist, shaded environments, growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
