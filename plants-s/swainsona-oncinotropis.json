    "intro": "Swainsona oncinotropis, commonly known as the yellow trumpet tree, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are pod-like structures that split open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats. Swainsona oncinotropis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
