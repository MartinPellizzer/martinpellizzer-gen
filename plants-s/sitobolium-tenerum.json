    "intro": "Sitobolium tenerum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it has slender, succulent stems adapted to conserve water. The leaves are often fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or desert environments. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
