    "intro": "Saussurea macrocephala, commonly known as the Chinese snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. Its habitat is typically in cold, arid environments where it thrives in rocky soils. Due to its medicinal significance and limited distribution, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
