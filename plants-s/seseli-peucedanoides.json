    "intro": "Seseli peucedanoides, commonly known as tall hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features a tall, erect stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the Apiaceae family. Seseli peucedanoides produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two mericarps that separate upon maturity."
