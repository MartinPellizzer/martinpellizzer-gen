    "intro": "Saccolabium constrictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for certain insects and wildlife."
