    "intro": "Stenogyne laculata, commonly known as the coastal stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Its blooming period occurs in the spring, producing clusters of pale blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stenogyne laculata is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
