    "intro": "Schismatoglottis puberulipes, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed schismatoglottis, is a rare tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
