    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. dolichostylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and tubers that are typically longer than those of standard potato varieties. This form exhibits unique morphological traits that distinguish it from typical Solanum tuberosum plants. It is often found in specific geographic regions where it has adapted to local environmental conditions. The plant retains the basic characteristics of the Solanaceae family, including its flowering structure and foliage."
