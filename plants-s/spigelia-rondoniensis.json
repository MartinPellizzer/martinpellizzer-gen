    "intro": "Spigelia rondoniensis, commonly known as the Rondonian spigelia, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its habitat in the dense rainforest, it is rarely found outside its native range and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
