    "intro": "Sterculia multinervia, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow or white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for construction and tool-making due to its durability. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
