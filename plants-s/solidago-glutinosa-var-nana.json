    "intro": "Solidago glutinosa var. nana, commonly known as sticky goldenrod dwarf, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features small, bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for moist, shady woodland habitats. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in naturalized areas."
