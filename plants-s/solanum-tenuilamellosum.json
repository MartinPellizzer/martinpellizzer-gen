    "intro": "Solanum tenuilamellosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that mature to a deep purple color. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically found in wild habitats rather than cultivated gardens."
