    "intro": "Specklinia variegata, commonly known as the variegated pigmy orchid, is a compact, epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features small, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation, which adds to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai enthusiasts."
