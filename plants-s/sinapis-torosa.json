    "intro": "Sinapis torosa, commonly known as the hairy mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces pods containing several round, black seeds, which are used as a source of oil in some regions. Sinapis torosa is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to various environments."
