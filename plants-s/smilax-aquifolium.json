    "intro": "Smilax aquifolium, commonly known as the evergreen smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that resemble holly, with spiny margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Smilax aquifolium is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
