    "intro": "Sabina sabinoides, commonly known as the Chinese juniper, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It features scale-like leaves that are dense and dark green, arranged in crossed pairs along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a landscape plant."
