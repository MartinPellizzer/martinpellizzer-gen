    "intro": "Solidago canadensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the Canadian goldenrod, is a variant of the goldenrod genus native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
