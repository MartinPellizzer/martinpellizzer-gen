It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely pinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a flowering period that coincides with the summer months. While not widely cultivated, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
