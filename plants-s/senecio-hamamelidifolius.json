    "intro": "Senecio hamamelidifolius, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that resemble those of the hamamelis, or witch hazel. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
