    "intro": "Stapelia namaquensis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf starfish plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often branching and covered in small, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive drought. This variety is smaller than the standard Stapelia namaquensis, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
