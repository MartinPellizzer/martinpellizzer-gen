    "intro": "Samolus americanus, commonly known as American sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and open woodlands. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
