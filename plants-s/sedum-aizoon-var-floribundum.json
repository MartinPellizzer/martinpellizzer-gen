    "intro": "Sedum aizoon var. floribundum, commonly known as the flowering stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
