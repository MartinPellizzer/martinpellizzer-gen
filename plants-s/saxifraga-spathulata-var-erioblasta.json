    "intro": "Saxifraga spathulata var. erioblasta, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with spoon-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
