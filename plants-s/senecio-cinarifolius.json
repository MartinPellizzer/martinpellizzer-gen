    "intro": "Senecio cinarifolius, commonly known as the desert everlasting or skyflower, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
