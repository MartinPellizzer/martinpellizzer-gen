    "intro": "Stewartia villosa, commonly known as the hairy stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Stewartia villosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks."
