    "intro": "Smilax excelsa, commonly known as the evergreen smilax, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a robust, woody stem with persistent, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Smilax excelsa is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its thick, spiny stems and ornamental foliage make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
