    "intro": "Sarracenia alabamensis subsp. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red, tubular pitchers that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils along the margins of bogs and swamps. Its leaves are modified into pitcher-shaped structures that serve as both traps and habitats for various small organisms. This subspecies is notable for its relatively large size and vibrant coloration compared to other Sarracenia species."
