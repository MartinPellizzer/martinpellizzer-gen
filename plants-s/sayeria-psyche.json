    "intro": "Sayeria psyche, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
