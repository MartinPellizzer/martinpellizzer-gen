    "intro": "Satyrium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
