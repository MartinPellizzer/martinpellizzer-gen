    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 discolor var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-color African milkweed, is a hybrid succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, three-toned flowers that range from yellow to orange and red, resembling the color of blood, which attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
