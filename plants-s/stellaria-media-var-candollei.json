    "intro": "Stellaria media var. candollei, commonly known as white starwort, is a variant of the common chickweed. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, star-shaped white flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along paths. This variant is distinguished by its pale coloration and slightly different morphology compared to the typical Stellaria media."
