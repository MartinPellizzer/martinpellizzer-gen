    "intro": "Swallenochloa vulcanalis, commonly known as the volcanic grass, is a rare and specialized plant native to the volcanic regions of New Zealand. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like morphology and adaptation to nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, often on volcanic rock or in disturbed areas. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low nutrient availability. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
