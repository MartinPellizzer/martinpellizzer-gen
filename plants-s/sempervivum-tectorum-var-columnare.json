    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. columnare, commonly known as the columnar houseleek, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features upright, cylindrical rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
