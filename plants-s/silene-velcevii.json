    "intro": "Silene velcevii, commonly known as the Velcevii catchfly, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in forested or rocky habitats. Silene velcevii is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
