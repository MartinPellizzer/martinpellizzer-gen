    "intro": "Sagitta rigida, commonly known as the rigid arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, with a distinctive rigid texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its botanical name reflects its rigid leaf structure and the arrow-like shape of its foliage."
