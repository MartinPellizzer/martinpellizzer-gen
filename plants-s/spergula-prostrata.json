    "intro": "Spergula prostrata, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms a dense mat of prostrate stems, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Spergula prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
