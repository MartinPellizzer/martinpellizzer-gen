    "intro": "Scabiosa trifida, commonly known as the fairy rings or devil's bits, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers are arranged in loose, spherical clusters. Scabiosa trifida is often found in sandy or loamy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
