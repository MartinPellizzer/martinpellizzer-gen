    "intro": "Selaginella eclipes, commonly known as the starry spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a unique, star-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores. Selaginella eclipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
