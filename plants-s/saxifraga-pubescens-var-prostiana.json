    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. prostiana, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in early summer. This variant is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its natural habitat."
