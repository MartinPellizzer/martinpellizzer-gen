    "intro": "Scandix glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth scurvygrass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, branching stems covered in fine, smooth hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Scandix glaberrima is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
