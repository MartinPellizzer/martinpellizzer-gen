    "intro": "Saxifraga boryi, commonly known as the Bory's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features clustered, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in the summer. It is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness. Saxifraga boryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
