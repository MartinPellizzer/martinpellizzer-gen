    "intro": "Sorbus chamaemespilus var. typica, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and has grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, red or orange berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in autumn. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland habitats."
