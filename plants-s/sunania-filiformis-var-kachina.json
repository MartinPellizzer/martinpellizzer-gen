    "intro": "Sunania filiformis var. kachina, commonly known as the Kachina sunflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, yellow-orange blooms that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
