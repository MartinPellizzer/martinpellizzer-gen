It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped seed pods. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring simple, alternate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds, a feature common in the Brassicaceae family.
