    "intro": "Spiesia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a small perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant."
