    "intro": "Santalum persicarium, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fragrant, pale pink flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties, though it is less commercially significant than other sandalwood species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
