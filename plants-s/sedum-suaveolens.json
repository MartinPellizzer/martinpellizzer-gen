It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
