    "intro": "Stemodia palustris var. simplex, commonly known as the simple swampstem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, linear, and slightly hairy as well. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
