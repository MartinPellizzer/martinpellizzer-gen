    "intro": "Siphocampylus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant features simple, sessile leaves that are typically clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
