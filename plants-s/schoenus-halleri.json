    "intro": "Schoenus halleri, commonly known as the Haller's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typical of many sedges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, which are usually green or brown in color. It is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Schoenus halleri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
