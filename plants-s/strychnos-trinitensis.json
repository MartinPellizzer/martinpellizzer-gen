    "intro": "Strychnos trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad starapple, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Strychnos trinitensis is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
