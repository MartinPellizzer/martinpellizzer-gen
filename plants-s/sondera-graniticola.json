    "intro": "Sondera graniticola, commonly known as the granitic rockrose, is a flowering plant native to rocky, arid environments in South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and is well adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in a dense, mat-like structure to reduce water loss. Sondera graniticola is often found growing on granite outcrops and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in dry garden settings."
