    "intro": "Sesleria insularis subsp. italica, commonly known as the Italian sesleria, is a compact, clump-forming grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, with a fine texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in Mediterranean-style landscapes."
