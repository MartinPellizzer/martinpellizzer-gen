    "intro": "Saxifraga serpyllifolia subsp. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically rosette-shaped, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for cold climates and high-altitude habitats."
