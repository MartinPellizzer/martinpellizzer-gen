It is characterized by its distinctive orange-red, inflated calyces that resemble small lanterns, which dry to a papery texture. The plant produces small white or yellow flowers that are followed by the characteristic fruiting structures. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Solanum orientale is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant, showy bracts."
