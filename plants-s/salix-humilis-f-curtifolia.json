    "intro": "Salix humilis f. curtifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely hairy. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize streambanks."
