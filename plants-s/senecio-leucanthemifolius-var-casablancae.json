It features bright yellow daisy-like flowers surrounded by white ray florets, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
