    "intro": "Scorodosma assa-foetida, commonly known as the stinking stick or the gum of the mountain. It is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. The plant produces a resinous gum that is harvested from its bark, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The resin has a strong, unpleasant odor, which gives the plant its common name. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves."
