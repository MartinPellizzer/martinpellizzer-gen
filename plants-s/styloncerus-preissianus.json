    "intro": "Styloncerus preissianus, commonly known as the African forest styloncerus, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae. It is primarily found in the tropical regions of Africa, where it inhabits dense forest ecosystems. The beetle's body is typically elongated and cylindrical, with a hard exoskeleton that provides protection against predators. Its diet mainly consists of plant material, though specific host plants are not well documented. This species plays a minor role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the decomposition process and nutrient cycling."
