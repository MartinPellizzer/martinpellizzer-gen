    "intro": "Solanum poecilochromifolium, commonly known as the variable-colored nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its diverse leaf coloration, ranging from green to reddish hues, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with five petals, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its unique appearance and potential toxicity, it is often found in shaded, moist environments."
