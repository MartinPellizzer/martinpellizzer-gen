    "intro": "Scandicium stellatum, commonly known as the star-stemmed scandicium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Scandinavia. It features slender, wiry stems that are often adorned with small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on the edges of mountain meadows. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a protected species in several countries."
