It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, often with a glossy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds."
