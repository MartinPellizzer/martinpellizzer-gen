    "intro": "Saussurea pulchella var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow flower heads that resemble those of the safflower. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves with serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, arid conditions. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
