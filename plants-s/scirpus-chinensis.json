    "intro": "Scirpus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Scirpus chinensis thrives in marshy areas and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
