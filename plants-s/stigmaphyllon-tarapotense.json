It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
