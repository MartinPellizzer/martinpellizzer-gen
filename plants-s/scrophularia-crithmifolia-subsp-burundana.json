    "intro": "Scrophularia crithmifolia subsp. burundana, commonly known as Burundan scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Burundi and eastern Congo. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
