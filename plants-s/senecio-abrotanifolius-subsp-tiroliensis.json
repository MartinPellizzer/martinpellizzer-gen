    "intro": "Senecio abrotanifolius subsp. tiroliensis, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
