    "intro": "Senecio tricuspidatus var. dumosus, commonly known as the bushy senecio, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features compact, densely branched growth with small, narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
