    "intro": "Stipa caespitosa var. elata, commonly known as tall needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
