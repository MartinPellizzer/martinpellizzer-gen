    "intro": "Schoenoplectus pseudotriqueter, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically found in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Schoenoplectus pseudotriqueter is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
