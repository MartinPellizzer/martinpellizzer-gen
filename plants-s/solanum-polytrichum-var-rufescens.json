It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. The berries it produces are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant with both ecological and potential medicinal significance."
