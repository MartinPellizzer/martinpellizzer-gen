    "intro": "Salix versifolia var. sericeotomentosa, commonly known as the silky-tomentose willow, is a variant of the willow tree characterized by its soft, silvery-white pubescence on its leaves and stems. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-gray underside, which gives it a unique appearance. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological systems. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
