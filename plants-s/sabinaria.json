It consists of several species, most notably Sabinaria montana, which is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. These plants are evergreen shrubs or small trees characterized by their scale-like leaves and conical or rounded crowns. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high elevations. Sabinaria species are known for their aromatic foliage and are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
