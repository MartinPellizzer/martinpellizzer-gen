    "intro": "Sphaeropteris zamboangana, commonly known as the Zamboanga cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is typically found in lowland to montane rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
