    "intro": "Senegalia lewisii, commonly known as the Lewis acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Additionally, it has been used by indigenous peoples for its fibers and medicinal properties."
