    "intro": "Selaginella caffrorum var. aethiopica, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its adaptability to varying humidity levels."
