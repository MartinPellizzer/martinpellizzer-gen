    "intro": "Sorbus subtomentosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly-gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called pomes, which are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
