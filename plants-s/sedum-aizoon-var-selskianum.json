    "intro": "Sedum aizoon var. selskianum, commonly known as the Selskian stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
