    "intro": "Sisymbrium millefolium var. brachycarpum, commonly known as narrow-fruit shepherd's purse, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, cruciform flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, narrow pods that contain several seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from other varieties of shepherd's purse. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This variant is notable for its unique seed pod morphology and its role in supporting pollinators."
