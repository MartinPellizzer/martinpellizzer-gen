    "intro": "Sclerocactus parviflorus f. variiflorus, commonly known as the variable-flowered small-flowered sclerocactus, is a unique variant of the species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and dense clusters of short, spiny stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short, lateral branches. Its foliage consists of thick, fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This form is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its distinctive appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
