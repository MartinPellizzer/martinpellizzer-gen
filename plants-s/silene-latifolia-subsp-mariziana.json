    "intro": "Silene latifolia subsp. mariziana, commonly known as the alpine catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette, helping it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Silene latifolia."
