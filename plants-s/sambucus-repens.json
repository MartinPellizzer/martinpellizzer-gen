    "intro": "Sambucus repens, commonly known as red elderberry, is a perennial shrub native to the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Sambucus repens typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed."
