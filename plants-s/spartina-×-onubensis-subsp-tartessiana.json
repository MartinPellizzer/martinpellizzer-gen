    "intro": "Spartina \u00d7 onubensis subsp. tartessiana, commonly known as the Spanish cordgrass, is a hybrid plant native to the coastal regions of southern Spain and northern Africa. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has a robust rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and stabilize coastal soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silver-gray coloration due to dense pubescence. Spartina \u00d7 onubensis subsp. tartessiana plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
