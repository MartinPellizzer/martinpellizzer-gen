    "intro": "Selaginella lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique structure with small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on the ground. Its sporophytes are characterized by short, segmented stems and clusters of sporangia that produce spores for reproduction. Selaginella lauterbachii is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms."
