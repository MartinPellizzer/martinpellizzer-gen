    "intro": "Silphium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected compass plant, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and distinctive leaves with a deeply dissected appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a composite head typical of the Asteraceae family. Silphium dissectum is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. It is also valued for its historical use by Native American tribes and its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
