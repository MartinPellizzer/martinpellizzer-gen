    "intro": "Stellaria neopalustris, commonly known as the bog star, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in star-shaped umbels, giving it its common name. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and fens. Stellaria neopalustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
