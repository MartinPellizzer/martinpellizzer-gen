    "intro": "Sorghum centroplicatum var. pseudoneesii, commonly known as the African millet, is a drought-tolerant grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces small, hard grains that are adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used as a staple food crop and for animal fodder in regions with limited water resources. Its botanical features make it an important species for agricultural resilience in challenging climates."
