    "intro": "Stellaria tomentella, commonly known as the woolly starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Stellaria tomentella is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
