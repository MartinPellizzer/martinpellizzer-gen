    "intro": "Sarcotoechia angulata, commonly known as the angular sarcotoechia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its angular, ribbed stems and palmate leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
