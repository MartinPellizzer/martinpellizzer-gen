    "intro": "Specklinia plantaginea, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
