    "intro": "Solanum henryi, commonly known as Henry's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to China. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
