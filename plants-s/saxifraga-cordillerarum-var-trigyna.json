    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerarum var. trigyna, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is part of the Saxifragaceae family and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude conditions with limited soil and nutrients."
