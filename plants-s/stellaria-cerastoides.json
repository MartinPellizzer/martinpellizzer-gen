    "intro": "Stellaria cerastoides, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Eurasia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered with fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged oppositely. Its flowers are surrounded by five narrow sepals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Stellaria cerastoides is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
