    "intro": "Stapelia furcata, commonly known as the forked stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in arid environments. Stapelia furcata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
