    "intro": "Stipa ayacuchensis, commonly known as the Ayacucho grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
