    "intro": "Sorocea ilicifolia f. laxiflora, commonly known as the soft-leaved holly fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, leathery texture. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest in North America. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, upright fronds that are typically 20\u201330 cm in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
