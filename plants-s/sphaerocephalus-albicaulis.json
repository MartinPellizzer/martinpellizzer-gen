    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed globeflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and unique, spherical flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in compact, globe-like formations. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
