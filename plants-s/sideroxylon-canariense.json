    "intro": "Sideroxylon canariense, commonly known as the Canary Islands ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Sideroxylon canariense is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
