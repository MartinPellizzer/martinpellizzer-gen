    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pischpekensis, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a hybrid species native to the cold regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh climates, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
