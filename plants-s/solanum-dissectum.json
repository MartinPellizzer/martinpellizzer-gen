    "intro": "Solanum dissectum, commonly known as the dissected nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its finely lobed, maple-like leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
