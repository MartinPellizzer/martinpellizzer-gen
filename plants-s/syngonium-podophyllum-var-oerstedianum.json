    "intro": "Syngonium podophyllum var. oerstedianum, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a climbing perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that vary in color from light green to deep maroon, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
