    "intro": "Sorocephalus teretifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorocephalus, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
