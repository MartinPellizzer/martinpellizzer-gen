    "intro": "Spiraea sorbifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf meadow spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches heights of only 10\u201330 centimeters, making it a compact and ornamental plant. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
