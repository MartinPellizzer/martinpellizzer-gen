    "intro": "Selaginella smithiorum, commonly known as the Smith's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has whorled leaves that are often a dark green color, and it produces strobila (cone-like structures) that contain spores. Selaginella smithiorum is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. It is also notable for its role in ecological systems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
