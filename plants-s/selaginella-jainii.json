    "intro": "Selaginella jainii, commonly known as the Jain's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a slender, branching stem and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of the spikemoss family. Selaginella jainii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
