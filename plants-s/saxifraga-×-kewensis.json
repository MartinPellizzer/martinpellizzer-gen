    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 kewensis, commonly known as the Kew saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the Arctic and alpine regions, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in frost resistance. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly garden settings."
