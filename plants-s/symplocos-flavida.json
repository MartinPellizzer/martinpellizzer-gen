    "intro": "Symplocos flavida, commonly known as the yellow alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos flavida thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mixed evergreen forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the Pacific Northwest's ecological landscape."
