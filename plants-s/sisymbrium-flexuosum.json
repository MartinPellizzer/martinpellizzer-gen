    "intro": "Sisymbrium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically appear in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures, and relies on parasitic relationships with host plants for nutrients. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Due to its lack of chlorophyll, it is often found in disturbed soils where it can attach to and feed on grasses and other herbaceous plants."
