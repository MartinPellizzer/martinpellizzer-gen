    "intro": "Stevia elongata var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that often display a distinctive purplish hue, especially under stress or in cooler conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain steviol glycosides. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
