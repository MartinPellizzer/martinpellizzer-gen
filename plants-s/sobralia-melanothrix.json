    "intro": "Sobralia melanothrix, commonly known as the black-stemmed sobralia, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of orange and red. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sobralia melanothrix is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper conditions."
