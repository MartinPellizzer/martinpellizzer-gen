    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are usually yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
