    "intro": "Sciaphila torricellensis, commonly known as the Torricelli shadeplant, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in the shaded understory of forests. Its leaves are leathery and thick, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, low-light environment. Sciaphila torricellensis is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
