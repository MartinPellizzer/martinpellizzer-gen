    "intro": "Spergularia tasmanica, commonly known as Tasmanian sandplain grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Tasmania. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its fine,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Tasmania."
