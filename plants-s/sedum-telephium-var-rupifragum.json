    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. rupifragum, commonly known as Crimson Carpet, is a low-growing succulent native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it ideal for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its drought tolerance and cold hardiness make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
