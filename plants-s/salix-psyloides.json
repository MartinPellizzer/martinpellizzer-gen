    "intro": "Salix psyloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, arching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. Its catkins are prominent in early spring, with male and female flowers appearing on separate branches. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
