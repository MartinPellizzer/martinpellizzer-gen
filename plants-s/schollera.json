    "intro": "Schollera, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features a broad, spreading canopy with opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Schollera is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it a common ornamental plant. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
