    "intro": "Scleranthus pictus, commonly known as the painted sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Scleranthus pictus is adapted to thrive in disturbed or dry environments, making it a common sight in coastal and inland areas."
