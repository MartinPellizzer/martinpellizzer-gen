    "intro": "Scleranthus annuus subsp. annuus, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with spiny leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy texture and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, spherical husk, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The species is known for its adaptability and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
