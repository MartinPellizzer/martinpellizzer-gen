    "intro": "Sempervivum altum, commonly known as the high mountain houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces tall, flowering stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple. It is a hardy perennial that prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum altum is also noted for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
