    "intro": "Silene ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanensis campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene ajanensis plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
