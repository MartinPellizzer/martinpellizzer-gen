    "intro": "Stachys arriagana, commonly known as the mountain betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its often arid or rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Stachys arriagana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in herbal medicine."
