    "intro": "Sporobolus compositus var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
