    "intro": "Salvia popenoei, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a striking perennial shrub native to the highlands of Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient addition to xeriscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
