    "intro": "Specklinia gongylodes, commonly known as the coral fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often tinged with a pink or coral hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in its natural habitat. Specklinia gongylodes is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care in the right conditions."
