    "intro": "Struthiopteris cavaleriana, commonly known as the Cavalerian's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. The plant's rhizome is robust and often covered in a layer of protective scales."
