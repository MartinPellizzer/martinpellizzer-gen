    "intro": "Scopellaria marginata var. marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf scurvygrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent odor. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy shores, tolerating salt spray and tidal fluctuations. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited."
