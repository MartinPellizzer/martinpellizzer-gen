    "intro": "Saxifraga aquatica, commonly known as water saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and Asia. It thrives in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer. Saxifraga aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
