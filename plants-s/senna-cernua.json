    "intro": "Senna cernua, commonly known as the yellow corymbia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Senna cernua is often found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
