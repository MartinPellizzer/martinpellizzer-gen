    "intro": "Sarcococca pruniformis, commonly known as the fragrant winterberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late winter, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic leaves and seasonal color changes."
