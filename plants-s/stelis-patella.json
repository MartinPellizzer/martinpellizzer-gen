    "intro": "Stelis patella, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has a slender, upright stem with few leaves, and its flowers are small, often pale green or white, with a distinctive lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the rocky substrate. Due to its habitat specificity, Stelis patella is often found in humid, shaded areas with well-drained soil."
