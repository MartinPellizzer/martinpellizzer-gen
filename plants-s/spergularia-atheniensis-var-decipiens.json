It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, pinkish or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.
