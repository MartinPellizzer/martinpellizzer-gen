    "intro": "Sedum paniculatum, commonly known as autumn sedum, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. It produces a showy inflorescence of white to pink flowers in the fall, which attracts pollinators. Sedum paniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
