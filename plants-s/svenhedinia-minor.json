    "intro": "Svenhedinia minor, commonly known as the small sedge, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Svenhedinia minor is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
