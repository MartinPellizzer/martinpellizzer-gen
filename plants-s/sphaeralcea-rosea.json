    "intro": "Sphaeralcea rosea, commonly known as the roseapple or desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Sphaeralcea rosea is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
