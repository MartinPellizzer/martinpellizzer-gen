    "intro": "Solanum rupicola, commonly known as the rock nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically toxic to humans and animals. Solanum rupicola thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often found in coastal and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
