It is native to South America and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that resemble tomatoes but are typically less fleshy. Solanum cultum is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations in harsh environments."
