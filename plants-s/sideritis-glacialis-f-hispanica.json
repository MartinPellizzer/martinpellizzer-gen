It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
