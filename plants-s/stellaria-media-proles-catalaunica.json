It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by small, white flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. This plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and spreads through stolons, making it a resilient weed in various habitats. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other species in the Stellaria genus."
