    "intro": "Sparganium minimum var. perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf bur-reed, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with small, spadix-like inflorescences that produce tiny, greenish flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. The species is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it contributes to the ecological balance of its environment."
