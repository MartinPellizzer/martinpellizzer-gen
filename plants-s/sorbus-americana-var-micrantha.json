    "intro": "Sorbus americana var. micrantha, commonly known as the American whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
