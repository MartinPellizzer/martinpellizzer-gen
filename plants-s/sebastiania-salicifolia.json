    "intro": "Sebastiania salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Sebastiania salicifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
