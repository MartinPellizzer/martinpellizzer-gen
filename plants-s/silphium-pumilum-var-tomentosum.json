    "intro": "Silphium pumilum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Silphium pumilum var. tomentosum plays an important role in supporting pollinators like butterflies and bees."
