    "intro": "Salix pumila, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellowish-green in color. Salix pumila thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
