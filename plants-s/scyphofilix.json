    "intro": "Scyphofilix, commonly known as the sea holly, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble small sea urchins. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Scyphofilix is a short-lived perennial, typically growing to a height of only a few inches, making it a delicate and rare addition to coastal flora."
