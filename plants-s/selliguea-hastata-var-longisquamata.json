    "intro": "Selliguea hastata var. longisquamata, commonly known as the long-squamate moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright green, closely spaced leaves. The leaves are typically elongated and have a distinct midrib, with a smooth or slightly rough upper surface. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to humid, nutrient-rich habitats, making it a common indicator species in certain ecosystems."
