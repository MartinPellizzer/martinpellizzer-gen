It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils and open areas. It has a sprawling growth habit and produces seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. Salsola aperta is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
