    "intro": "Smilax bracteata var. verruculosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, warty bumps, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough texture. This variety is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
