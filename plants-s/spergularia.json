    "intro": "Spergularia, commonly known as sea spurge, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, where they exhibit adaptations to high salinity and wind exposure. Spergularia species are often small, herbaceous plants with simple, linear leaves and showy, pink or white flowers. They play a role in stabilizing sandy or coastal soils and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Some species are also considered invasive in certain regions."
