    "intro": "Stellaria rigida var. typica, commonly known as hardy stitchwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing in clusters at the ends of stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
