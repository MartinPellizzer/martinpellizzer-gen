    "intro": "Stipa pentapogon, commonly known as the five-awned grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its flowering stems. The plant's inflorescence consists of several narrow, cylindrical spikelets, each bearing a single floret with five awns, which are bristle-like structures. Stipa pentapogon thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it requires full sun and moderate moisture."
