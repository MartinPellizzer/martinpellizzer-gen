The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a reddish hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into the distinctive burr-like fruits. Sparganium \u00d7 longifolium plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
