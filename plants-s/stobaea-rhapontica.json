    "intro": "Stobaea rhapontica, commonly known as the rhapontic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Stobaea rhapontica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
