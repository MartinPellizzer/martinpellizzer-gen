    "intro": "Sisymbrium sinapoides, commonly known as wild mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The seeds are small, oval, and enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
