    "intro": "Stylidium calcaratum, commonly known as the sandhill catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and linear leaves, adapted to thrive in sandy or disturbed soils. Its unique feature is the presence of a spurred petal, which is a specialized structure that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Stylidium calcaratum is often found in open habitats such as sandplains and roadsides, where it contributes to the local flora diversity."
