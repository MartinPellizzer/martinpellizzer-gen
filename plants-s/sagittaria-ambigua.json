    "intro": "Sagittaria ambigua, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the water depth. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, canoe-shaped fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Sagittaria ambigua is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
