    "intro": "Salvia lacei, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Salvia lacei thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
