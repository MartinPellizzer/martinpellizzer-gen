    "intro": "Stelis sulcata, commonly known as the crested stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the rainy season. Stelis sulcata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care make it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
