    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. oscillans, commonly known as the rockfoil or mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variant is distinguished by its oscillating growth pattern, where the stems bend and sway in the wind, giving it a unique appearance."
