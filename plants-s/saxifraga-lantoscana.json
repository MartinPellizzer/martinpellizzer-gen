    "intro": "Saxifraga lantoscana, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly substrates."
