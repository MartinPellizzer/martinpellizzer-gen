    "intro": "Stipa angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are usually light green to pale yellow in color. Stipa angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
