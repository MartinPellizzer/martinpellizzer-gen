    "intro": "Sarcopodium pulchellum, commonly known as the purple ground orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like and often form a dense mat, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
