    "intro": "Smallanthus riograndensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil and Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, yellow-orange composite flower heads that resemble sunflowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in some regions for gardening and restoration projects."
