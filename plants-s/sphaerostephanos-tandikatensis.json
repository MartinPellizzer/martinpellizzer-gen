    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos tandikatensis, commonly known as the Tandikatensis starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, herbaceous stem with narrow, lanceolate leaves arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with six petals that are fused at the base, forming a tubular shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphaerostephanos tandikatensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
