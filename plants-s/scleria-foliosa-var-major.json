    "intro": "Scleria foliosa var. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with the leaves often having a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
