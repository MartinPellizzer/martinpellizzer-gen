    "intro": "Syngonanthus oblongus f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed evergreen hibiscus, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, arranged in whorls along its short, sturdy stems. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in container gardening and as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
