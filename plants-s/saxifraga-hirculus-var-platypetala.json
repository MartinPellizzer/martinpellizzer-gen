    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus var. platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
