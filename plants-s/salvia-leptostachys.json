    "intro": "Salvia leptostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems covered in grayish-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
