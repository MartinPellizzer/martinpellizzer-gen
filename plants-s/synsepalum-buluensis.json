    "intro": "Synsepalum buluensis, commonly known as the Bulu miracle fruit, is a climbing shrub native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they turn from green to yellow. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic pulp. It is notable for its unique ability to impart a prolonged sweet taste to the mouth, a property attributed to its high concentration of miraculin."
