    "intro": "Selaginella landii, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Selaginella landii reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
