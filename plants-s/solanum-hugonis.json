    "intro": "Solanum hugonis, commonly known as the Hugon's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually violet or purple in color. Its fruit is a yellowish berry that ripens in the fall and contains toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated or used in traditional medicine."
