    "intro": "Silene setacea var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its common name. This variety is a variant of Silene setacea, distinguished by its reduced hair coverage compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
