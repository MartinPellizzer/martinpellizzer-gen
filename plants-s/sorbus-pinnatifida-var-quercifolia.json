    "intro": "Sorbus pinnatifida var. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that resemble oak leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, red-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native range."
