It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and fine, silver-gray leaves that are covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Stipa papillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
