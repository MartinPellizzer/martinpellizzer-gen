    "intro": "Scutellaria granulosa, commonly known as the granular skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive skullcap-like calyx, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Scutellaria. Scutellaria granulosa is often used in herbal medicine for its purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
