    "intro": "Schlimia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas and are characterized by their composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. Schlimia species typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of dandelions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
