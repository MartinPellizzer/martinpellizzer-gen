    "intro": "Scleria polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited speargrass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, followed by clusters of dry, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Scleria polycarpa is often found in moist grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
