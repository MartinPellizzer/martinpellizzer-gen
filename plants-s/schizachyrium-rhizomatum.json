    "intro": "Schizachyrium rhizomatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Schizachyrium rhizomatum is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a component of native plant landscapes."
