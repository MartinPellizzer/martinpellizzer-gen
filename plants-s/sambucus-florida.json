    "intro": "Sambucus florida, commonly known as the common elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. Sambucus florida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
