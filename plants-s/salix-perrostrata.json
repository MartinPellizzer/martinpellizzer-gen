    "intro": "Salix perrostrata, commonly known as the Mongolian willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous areas. Salix perrostrata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
