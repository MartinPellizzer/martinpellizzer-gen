    "intro": "Skimmia fortunei var. rubella, commonly known as the red-skinned skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive red or orange rim, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and low maintenance requirements."
