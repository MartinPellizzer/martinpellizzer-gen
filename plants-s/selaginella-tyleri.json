    "intro": "Selaginella tyleri, commonly known as the stair-step spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to arid regions of North America. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded environments. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. It reproduces via spores, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic phase. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often used in horticulture and as a subject of botanical study."
