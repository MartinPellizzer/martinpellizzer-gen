    "intro": "Stephanotrichum, commonly known as the marsh mallow or swamp mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist, often nutrient-rich soils. They are characterized by their hairy stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are usually alternate and have a distinctive shape, often with lobed or serrated edges. Stephanotrichum species are valued for their ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
