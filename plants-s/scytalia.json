    "intro": "Scytalia, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like white flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three feet in diameter. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
