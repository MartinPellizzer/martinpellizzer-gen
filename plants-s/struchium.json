    "intro": "Struchium, commonly known as gooseweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs with distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and small, greenish or reddish flowers. They are often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in temperate climates. Struchium species are characterized by their swollen, club-like seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered weeds but others have been used in traditional medicine."
