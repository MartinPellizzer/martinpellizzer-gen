    "intro": "Sarcanthus belophorus, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many other spurge species known for their unique floral structures. Sarcanthus belophorus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
