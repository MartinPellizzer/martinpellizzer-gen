    "intro": "Scutellaria violascens, commonly known as violet scutellaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 inches and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure, typical of the mint family. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it thrives in moist, woodland environments. Scutellaria violascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
