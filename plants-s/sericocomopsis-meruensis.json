    "intro": "Sericocomopsis meruensis, commonly known as the East African orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are often violet or blue in color, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sericocomopsis meruensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
