    "intro": "Stipa orthoraphium, commonly known as the narrowleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or bluish in color. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. Stipa orthoraphium is often found in steppe and desert habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for livestock."
