    "intro": "Steudelia cymosa, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Steudelia cymosa is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species of the coastal ecosystem."
