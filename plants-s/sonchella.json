    "intro": "Sonchella, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Sonchella is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
