    "intro": "Serjania circumvallata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red serjania, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling cherries. Its fruit is edible and contains a single seed, making it an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
