It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often reduced or absent in some varieties, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Sclerolobium denudatum is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought-prone environments."
