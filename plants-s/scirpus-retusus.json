    "intro": "Scirpus retusus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and dark green, with a slightly waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus retusus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and wetland organisms."
