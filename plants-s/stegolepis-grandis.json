    "intro": "Stegolepis grandis, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a central rhizome, and its leaves are typically broad and strap-like. Stegolepis grandis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
