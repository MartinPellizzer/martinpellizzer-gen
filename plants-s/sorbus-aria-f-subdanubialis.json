    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. subdanubialis, commonly known as the Danube whitebeam, is a botanical variant of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin, and they turn a striking orange-red in the autumn. This subspecies is native to Central Europe, particularly along the Danube River, and thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, contributing to local biodiversity and ecological stability."
