    "intro": "Stenostephanus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapan mountain orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky outcrops or tree trunks. Its unique floral structure and limited geographic range make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
