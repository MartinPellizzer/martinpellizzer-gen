    "intro": "Satyrium monophyllum, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated leaf and a slender stem that bears a single, showy orchid flower. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Satyrium monophyllum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
