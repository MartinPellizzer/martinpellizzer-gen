    "intro": "Spondias pinnata, commonly known as the flame tree or pinnate spondias, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are pinnate, with multiple leaflets arranged along a central axis, giving it a feathery appearance. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
