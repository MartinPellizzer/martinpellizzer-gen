    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon gracilis, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in crevices and loose soil. Saxifraga aizoon gracilis is often found in rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
