    "intro": "Silene odontopetala var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the glabrous toothed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrifolia has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas with well-drained soil. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
