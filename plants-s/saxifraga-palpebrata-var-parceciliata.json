    "intro": "Saxifraga palpebrata var. parceciliata, commonly known as the Sierra Valley saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
