    "intro": "Seticereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with large, fragrant flowers that open at night. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with thick, fleshy stems that store water. The flowers are usually white or pale in color, and they play an important role in attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Seticereus species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their striking appearance and unique blooming patterns."
