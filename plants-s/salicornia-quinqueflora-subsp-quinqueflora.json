    "intro": "Salicornia quinqueflora subsp. quinqueflora, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a succulent perennial that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries. The plant has jointed, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, scale-like leaves are usually found in clusters at the nodes. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences."
