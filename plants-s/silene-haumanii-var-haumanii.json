    "intro": "Silene haumanii var. haumanii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Silene haumanii var. haumanii is also notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
