It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in its natural habitat."
