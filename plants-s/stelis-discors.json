    "intro": "Stelis discors, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that often have a distinctive zigzag pattern on their petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Stelis discors is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
