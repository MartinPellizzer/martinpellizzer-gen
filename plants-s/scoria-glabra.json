    "intro": "Scoria glabra, commonly known as the smooth scoria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers during the late winter to early spring. Scoria glabra thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of coastal vegetation in its native habitat."
