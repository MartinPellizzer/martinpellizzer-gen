    "intro": "Statice echinata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice echinata is also cultivated as a ornamental plant for its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
