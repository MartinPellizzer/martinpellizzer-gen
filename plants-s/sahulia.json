    "intro": "Sahulia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a flowering plant belonging to the Nymphaeaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, flexible stems that rise from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long petioles. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a distinct central stigma surrounded by numerous stamens. Sahulia plays a significant role in both ecological and cultural contexts, symbolizing purity and rebirth in Egyptian mythology."
