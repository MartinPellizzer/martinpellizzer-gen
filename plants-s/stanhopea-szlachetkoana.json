    "intro": "Stanhopea szlachetkoana, commonly known as the Szlachetko's Stanhopea, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated floral structure with vibrant, often yellow or orange-colored petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and beetles. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
