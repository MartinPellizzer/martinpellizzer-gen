    "intro": "Syringa amurensis, commonly known as Amur honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climate conditions. Syringa amurensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
