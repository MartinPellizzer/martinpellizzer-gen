It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces a single, showy yellow flower at the end of a slender stem.
