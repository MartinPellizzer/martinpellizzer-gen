    "intro": "Sporobolus virginicus subsp. littoralis, commonly known as coastal sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important stabilizer of coastal dunes. Its ability to spread via rhizomes helps it form dense vegetation that protects against erosion."
