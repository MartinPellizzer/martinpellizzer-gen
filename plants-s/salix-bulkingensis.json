    "intro": "Salix bulkingensis, commonly known as the Bulkingensis willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
