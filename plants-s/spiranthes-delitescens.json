    "intro": "Spiranthes delitescens, commonly known as the fading spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and its unique, spiral arrangement of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing a delicate, fragrant floral display. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as wetlands and pine flatwoods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
