It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
