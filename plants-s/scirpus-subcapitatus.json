    "intro": "Scirpus subcapitatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge at the base. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers at the top of the stem, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. Scirpus subcapitatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
