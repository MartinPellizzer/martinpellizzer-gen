    "intro": "Stipa iberica var. pseudodasyphylla, commonly known as the Iberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
