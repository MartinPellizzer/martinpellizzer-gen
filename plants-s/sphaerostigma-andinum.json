    "intro": "Sphaerostigma andinum, commonly known as the Andean globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny fruiting bodies that resemble small globes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the high-altitude environment. Sphaerostigma andinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
