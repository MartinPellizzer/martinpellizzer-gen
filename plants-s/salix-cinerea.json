    "intro": "Salix cinerea, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a slightly serrated edge. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses."
