    "intro": "Symplocos cochinchinensis var. sessifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
