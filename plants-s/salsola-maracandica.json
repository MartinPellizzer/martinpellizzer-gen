    "intro": "Salsola maracandica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is an annual or biennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers. Native to Central Asia, it has become naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
