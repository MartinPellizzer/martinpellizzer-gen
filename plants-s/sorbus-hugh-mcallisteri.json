    "intro": "Sorbus hugh-mcallisteri, commonly known as the McAllister's whitebeam, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as pomes, which are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
