    "intro": "Sempervivum barbatum, commonly known as the Wooly Houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. Sempervivum barbatum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
