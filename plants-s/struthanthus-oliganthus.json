It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and specialized structures for water storage and drought tolerance. Struthanthus oliganthus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
