    "intro": "Spiraea macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, cone-shaped clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters in length. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Spiraea macrophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
