It is a tall, herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming part of the vegetation in marshes and along lake shores. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
