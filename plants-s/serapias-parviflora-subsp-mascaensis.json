    "intro": "Serapias parviflora subsp. mascaensis, commonly known as the Mascan serapias, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Capparaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow-orange flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to the typical form of Serapias parviflora. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
