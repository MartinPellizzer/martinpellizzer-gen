    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. vulgaris, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters, usually from late spring to early summer. Saxifraga aizoon var. vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, rocky habitats."
