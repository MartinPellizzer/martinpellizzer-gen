    "intro": "Solanum rufum, commonly known as the red tomato bush, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible when ripe, though they contain toxic alkaloids in their unripe form. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in warm, sunny climates. Solanum rufum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant flowers and fruit."
