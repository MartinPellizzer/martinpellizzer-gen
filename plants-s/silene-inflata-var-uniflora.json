    "intro": "Silene inflata var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered bladderwort, is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens. This variety is distinguished by its solitary flower per stem, setting it apart from other varieties of Silene inflata."
