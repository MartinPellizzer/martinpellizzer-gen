    "intro": "Sedum praealtum subsp. monticola, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features erect, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine garden environments. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid conditions."
