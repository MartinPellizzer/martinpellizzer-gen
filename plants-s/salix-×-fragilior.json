    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilior, commonly known as the brittle willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant typically grows in moist, wetland environments, such as stream banks and marshes. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
