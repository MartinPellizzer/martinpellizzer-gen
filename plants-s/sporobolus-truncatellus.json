    "intro": "Sporobolus truncatellus, commonly known as the flatleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing three-awned lemma-like structures, which are distinctive features of the genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Sporobolus truncatellus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats."
