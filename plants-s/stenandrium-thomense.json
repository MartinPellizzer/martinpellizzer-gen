It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
