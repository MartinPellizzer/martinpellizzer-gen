    "intro": "Solanum lapazense, commonly known as the Lapaz nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its restricted habitat and limited study, Solanum lapazense remains a relatively obscure but ecologically significant species."
