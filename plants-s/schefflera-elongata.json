    "intro": "Schefflera elongata, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a distinctive, umbrella-like appearance. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, pale green bark and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight. Schefflera elongata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
