    "intro": "Sesuvium sessile, commonly known as saltwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a succulent species that thrives in saline and arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that store water, and it produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers. It is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations and extreme temperatures. Sesuvium sessile plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
