    "intro": "Statice obtusa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice obtusa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
