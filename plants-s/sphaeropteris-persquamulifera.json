    "intro": "Sphaeropteris persquamulifera, commonly known as the broad-leafed cyclosorus, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
