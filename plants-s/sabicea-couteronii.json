    "intro": "Sabicea couteronii, commonly known as the Couteron's sabicea, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which is characterized by the presence of nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pod fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
