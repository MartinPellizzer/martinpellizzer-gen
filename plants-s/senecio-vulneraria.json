    "intro": "Senecio vulneraria, commonly known as the bleeding crocus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like blooms. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Despite its common name, it is not related to true crocuses and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional use."
