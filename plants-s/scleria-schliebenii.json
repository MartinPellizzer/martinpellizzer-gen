    "intro": "Scleria schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's bulbous grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Scleria schliebenii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
