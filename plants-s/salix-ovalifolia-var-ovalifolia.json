    "intro": "Salix ovalifolia var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
