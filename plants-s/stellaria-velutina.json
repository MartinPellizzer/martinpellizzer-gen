    "intro": "Stellaria velutina, commonly known as velvet starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pink star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, giving it a delicate, star-like appearance. Stellaria velutina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed habitats."
