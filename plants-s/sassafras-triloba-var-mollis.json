    "intro": "Sassafras triloba var. mollis, commonly known as the silky sassafras, is a variant of the sassafras tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairless bark and trifoliate leaves that are typically glossy and have a mild, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elliptical, red-brown fruits. Its leaves and roots have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. This variant is relatively rare and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
