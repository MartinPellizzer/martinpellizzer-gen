    "intro": "Sorbus praemorsa, commonly known as the whitebeard rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Sorbus praemorsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
