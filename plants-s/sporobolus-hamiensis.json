    "intro": "Sporobolus hamiensis, commonly known as the Hami grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and wiry, cylindrical stems that often produce a dense, fibrous root system. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Sporobolus hamiensis is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
