    "intro": "Silene diversifolia subsp. bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
