    "intro": "Serapias guadinae, commonly known as the Guadina orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain. The plant features showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Serapias. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Serapias guadinae is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
