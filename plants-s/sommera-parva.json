    "intro": "Sommera parva, commonly known as the dwarf sommera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its succulent leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
