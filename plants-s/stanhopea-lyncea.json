    "intro": "Stanhopea lyncea, commonly known as the white-lipped stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its distinctive white petals and a prominent, pale yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the dry season, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
