    "intro": "Sideritis repens, commonly known as creeping ironwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces small, nut-like seeds. Sideritis repens is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
