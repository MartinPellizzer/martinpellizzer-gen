    "intro": "Sedum japonicum senanense, commonly known as the Japanese stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Japan and parts of Korea. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy environments."
