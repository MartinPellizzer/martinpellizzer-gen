    "intro": "Sorbus foliolosa var. ursina, commonly known as the bearberry rowan, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The berries are toxic to humans but are consumed by wildlife, contributing to seed dispersal."
