    "intro": "Selaginella pouzolziana f. angustiramosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikemoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated, and often narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including microspores and megaspores, are produced on specialized leaves called microphylls. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions through its desiccation tolerance, making it an interesting subject for botanical research."
