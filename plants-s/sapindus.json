    "intro": "Sapindus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the Sapindaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and alternate, simple leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fleshy, orange or red berries containing a single seed. Sapindus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value or for the production of natural soaps."
