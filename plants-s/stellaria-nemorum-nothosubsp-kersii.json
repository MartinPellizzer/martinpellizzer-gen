    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum nothosubsp. kersii, commonly known as the woodland starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to forested areas of Europe. It typically features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting insect pollinators and contributing to soil stability in its habitat."
