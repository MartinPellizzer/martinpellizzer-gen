    "intro": "Salix argyracea, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species. It thrives in wet, sandy soils and is often found in tundra and coastal areas. Silver willow plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic wildlife."
