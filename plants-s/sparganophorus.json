    "intro": "Sparganophorus, commonly known as the spurge or euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. They are often shrubs or herbs, with simple or lobed leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences called cyathia. Many species are adapted to arid environments, making them common in dry regions around the world. The genus includes both ornamental and medicinal species, though some are considered invasive."
