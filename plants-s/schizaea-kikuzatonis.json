It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spore-bearing spikes, which are often clustered at the tips of its stems.

Schizaea kikuzatonis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
