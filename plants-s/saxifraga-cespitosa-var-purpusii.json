    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
