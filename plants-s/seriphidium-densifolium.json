    "intro": "Seriphidium densifolium, commonly known as the denseleaf tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Seriphidium densifolium is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
