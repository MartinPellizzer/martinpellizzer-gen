    "intro": "Stenocalyx alagoensis, commonly known as the Alagoas stenocalyx, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
