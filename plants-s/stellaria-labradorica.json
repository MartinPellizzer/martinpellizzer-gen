    "intro": "Stellaria labradorica, commonly known as the Labrador starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in rocky or sandy soils, and is well adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Stellaria labradorica is an important component of tundra ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing food for various herbivores."
