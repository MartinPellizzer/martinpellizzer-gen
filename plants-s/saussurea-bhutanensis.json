    "intro": "Saussurea bhutanensis, commonly known as Bhutanian snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually basal, with a woolly texture, and it produces a single flower head at the top of the stem. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
