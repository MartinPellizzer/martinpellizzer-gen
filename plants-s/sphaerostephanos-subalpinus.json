    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
