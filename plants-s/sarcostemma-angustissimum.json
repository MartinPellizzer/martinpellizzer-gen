    "intro": "Sarcostemma angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twisting stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. The species is noted for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
