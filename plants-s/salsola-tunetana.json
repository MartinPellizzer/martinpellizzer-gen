    "intro": "Salsola tunetana, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are small and adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Salsola tunetana is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline habitats, showcasing its tolerance to high salinity and extreme temperatures."
