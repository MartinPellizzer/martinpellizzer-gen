    "intro": "Selaginella wallichii var. polystachya, commonly known as the Himalayan spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Selaginella wallichii var. polystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
