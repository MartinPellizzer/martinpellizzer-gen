    "intro": "Solanum morelliforme, commonly known as the Morellia nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, arid regions, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a berry that turns red when ripe, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. The plant contains alkaloids, which can be toxic, making it important to handle with care."
