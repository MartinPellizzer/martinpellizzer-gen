    "intro": "Saponaria alpina, commonly known as Alpine soapwort, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Saponaria alpina is known for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from the saponins present in its leaves and stems. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
