    "intro": "Sarcanthus halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is native to arid and coastal regions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it thrive in high-salt conditions. Its flowers are typically greenish or reddish, and it produces small, dry fruits. Sarcanthus halophilum plays a role in stabilizing soils in saline areas and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
