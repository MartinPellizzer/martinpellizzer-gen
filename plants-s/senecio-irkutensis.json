    "intro": "Senecio irkutensis, commonly known as the Irkutsk senecio, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Senecio irkutensis is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in high-altitude regions."
