    "intro": "Stachys aristata, commonly known as the silverleaf betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, and its spikes of violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Stachys aristata is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and healing properties."
