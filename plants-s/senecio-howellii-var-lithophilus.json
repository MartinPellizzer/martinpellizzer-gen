    "intro": "Senecio howellii var. lithophilus, commonly known as the stonecress senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. This variant is particularly adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
