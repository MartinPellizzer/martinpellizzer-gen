    "intro": "Strophocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with thick, fleshy stems that store water. The flowers are usually white or pale in color, and they attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Strophocereus species are popular among cactus enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and dramatic nighttime blooming."
