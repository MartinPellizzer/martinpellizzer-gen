It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Its leaves vary in shape and size, which is a key feature of its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
