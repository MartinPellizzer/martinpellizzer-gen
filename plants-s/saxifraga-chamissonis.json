    "intro": "Saxifraga chamissonis, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Saxifraga chamissonis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
