    "intro": "Sorbus incana, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of red berries in the autumn. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. Sorbus incana is often found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and moist habitats."
