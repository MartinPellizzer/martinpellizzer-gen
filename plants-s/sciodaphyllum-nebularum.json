    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum nebularum, commonly known as the cloudshade fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that resemble wisps of cloud. It thrives in cool, humid environments, typically found in shaded, forested areas with rich, moist soil. The plant's leaves are bioluminescent under moonlight, a trait that aids in its nocturnal pollination by specific species of moths. Its reproductive structures are concealed within intricate, spore-bearing capsules that develop at the base of the fronds. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum nebularum is considered a critically endangered species."
