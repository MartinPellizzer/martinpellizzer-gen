    "intro": "Schedonorus interruptus subsp. corsicus, commonly known as Corsican bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal dunes and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate salt and wind, making it well adapted to coastal environments. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
