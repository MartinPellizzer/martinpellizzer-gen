    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel plant. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and fibrous roots, which contribute to its hardiness. The white-flowered form is distinguished by its reduced pigmentation compared to the typical red or pink flowers of the species."
