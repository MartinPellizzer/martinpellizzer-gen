    "intro": "Sesleria fallax, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-blue in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps over time."
