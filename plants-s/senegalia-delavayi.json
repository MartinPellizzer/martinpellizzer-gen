    "intro": "Senegalia delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Senegalia delavayi is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood."
