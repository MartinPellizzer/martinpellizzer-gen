    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 ainsworthii var. delicatum, commonly known as the delicate selenipedium, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous forests. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in the wild."
