    "intro": "Solanum pterocaulon, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries. The berries are typically red when mature and contain toxic seeds, making the plant potentially hazardous if ingested. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
