It is a flowering plant characterized by its small, purple berries that mature in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is native to parts of southern Africa. It has simple, alternate leaves and produces small white or pale purple flowers. Due to its toxic berries, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
