    "intro": "Swida hemsleyi var. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled swida, is a rare and distinctive member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, slender petals that give it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained, acidic soils in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pink to white in color, with prominent stamens and a central pistil that extends beyond the petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
