    "intro": "Synaphea petiolaris subsp. petiolaris, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its toxic milky sap, it should be handled with care."
