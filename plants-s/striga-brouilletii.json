    "intro": "Striga brouilletii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant damage to crops. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is considered a major agricultural pest due to its impact on cereal crops. Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years."
