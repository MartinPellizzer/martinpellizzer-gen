    "intro": "Spiraea pubescens var. hailarensis, commonly known as the Hailar spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern regions of China. It features slender, arching stems that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a pale green underside, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is often cultivated for its compact growth habit and graceful flowering display."
