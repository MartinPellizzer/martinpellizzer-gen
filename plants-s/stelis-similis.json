    "intro": "Stelis similis, commonly known as the similar stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features long, slender stems that are often branched and covered in small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Stelis similis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
