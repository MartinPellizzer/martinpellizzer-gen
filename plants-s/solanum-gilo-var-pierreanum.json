    "intro": "Solanum gilo var. pierreanum, commonly known as the purple potato or wild potato, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used as food sources by local communities. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has hairy, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its tubers are typically purple or reddish in color, and they contain alkaloids that can be toxic if not properly prepared. This variety is closely related to other Solanum species and is of interest for both agricultural and botanical research."
