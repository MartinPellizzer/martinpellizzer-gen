    "intro": "Scolymocephalus turbiniflorus, commonly known as the turbiniflorous scolymocephalus, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, turbinated (spiral-shaped) floral structure, which is both visually striking and functionally adapted for pollination. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing structural support and aiding in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
