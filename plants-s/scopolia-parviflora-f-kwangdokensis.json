    "intro": "Scopolia parviflora f. kwangdokensis, commonly known as the Kwangdokensis scopolia, is a rare variant of the scopolia plant native to the Korean Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant features a tuberous root system and lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in woodland or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
