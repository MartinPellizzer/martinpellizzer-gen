    "intro": "Sparaxis villosa, commonly known as the woolly sparaxis, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to Mediterranean climates and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often used in rock gardens and as a cut flower due to its striking appearance. Sparaxis villosa is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
