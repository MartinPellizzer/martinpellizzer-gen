    "intro": "Stellaria fragilis, commonly known as brittle starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 20 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. Stellaria fragilis thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
