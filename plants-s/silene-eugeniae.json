    "intro": "Silene eugeniae, commonly known as the Eugenia's campion, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States, particularly Texas. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Silene eugeniae has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and its adaptation to specific environmental conditions."
