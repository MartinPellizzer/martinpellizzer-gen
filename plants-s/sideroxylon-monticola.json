    "intro": "Sideroxylon monticola, commonly known as the mountain ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, while its fruit is a capsule containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
