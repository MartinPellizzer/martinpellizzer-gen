It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate floral structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
