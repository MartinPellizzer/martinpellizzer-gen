    "intro": "Spennera circaeifolia, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, orchid-like flowers that display intricate red veins against a deep purple or violet background. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Spennera circaeifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
