    "intro": "Scleria grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Scleria grandifolia is often found in temperate regions of the Americas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats."
