    "intro": "Sobralia epiphytica, commonly known as the silver star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to minimize water loss in its natural habitat. Sobralia epiphytica is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
