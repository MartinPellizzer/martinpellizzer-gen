    "intro": "Solanum horridum var. repandifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and chaparral. Botanically, it is notable for its robust, spiny structure and its role in local ecosystems as a source of food for certain wildlife species."
