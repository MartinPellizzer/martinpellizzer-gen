It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the tropical island environment."
