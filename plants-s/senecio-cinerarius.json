    "intro": "Senecio cinerarius, commonly known as dusty miller, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost dust-like appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Senecio cinerarius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
