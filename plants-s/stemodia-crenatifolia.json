    "intro": "Stemodia crenatifolia, commonly known as the crested stemodia, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically lobed or notched. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
