    "intro": "Seseli setifera, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in arid environments. Seseli setifera is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
