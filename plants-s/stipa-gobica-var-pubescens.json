    "intro": "Stipa gobica var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves covered with short, hairy pubescence. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
