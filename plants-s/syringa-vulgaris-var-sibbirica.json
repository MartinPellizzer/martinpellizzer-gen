    "intro": "Syringa vulgaris var. sibbirica, commonly known as the Siberian lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to colder climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The variety is notable for its compact size and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
