    "intro": "Seseli depauperatum, commonly known as the poorflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its stem is often branched and somewhat hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
