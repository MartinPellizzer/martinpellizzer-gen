    "intro": "Syzygium quadrangulatum, commonly known as the four-angled guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its quadrangular (four-sided) stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, aromatic fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a glossy appearance. Syzygium quadrangulatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native regions."
