    "intro": "Schizocarpum tripodum, commonly known as the three-toed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Schizocarpum tripodum is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
