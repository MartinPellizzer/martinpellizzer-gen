    "intro": "Scirpus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its stiff, triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Scirpus carolinianus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
