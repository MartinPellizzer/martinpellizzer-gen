    "intro": "Serjania flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered serjania, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Serjaniaceae. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Serjania flaviflora is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
