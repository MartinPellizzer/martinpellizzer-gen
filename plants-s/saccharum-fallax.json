    "intro": "Saccharum fallax, commonly known as the false sugar cane, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect stalks and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. While it resembles true sugar cane, it is not economically valuable for sugar production. Its ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
