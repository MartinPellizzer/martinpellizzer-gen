    "intro": "Sambucus pubescens, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and covered in fine hairs. Sambucus pubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
