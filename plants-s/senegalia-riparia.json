    "intro": "Senegalia riparia, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs and have a distinctive, bean-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Senegalia riparia is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
