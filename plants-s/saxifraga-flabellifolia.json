    "intro": "Saxifraga flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga flabellifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
