    "intro": "Salix vulpina var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. The pubescent willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
