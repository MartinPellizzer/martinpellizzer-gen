    "intro": "Serratula uniflosculosa, commonly known as the single-flower sagewort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Serratula uniflosculosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
