It is characterized by its large, star-shaped flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia mastodis is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and unique growth habits."
