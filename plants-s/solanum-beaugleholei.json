    "intro": "Solanum beaugleholei, commonly known as the Beauglehole's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. Its fruits are small berries that change color as they mature, often from green to yellow or red. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
