    "intro": "Sarracenia heterophylla, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a species of tropical pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves vary in size and coloration depending on environmental conditions, with some developing a deep purple hue. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid, sunny environment to flourish. Sarracenia heterophylla is a popular ornamental plant among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological function."
