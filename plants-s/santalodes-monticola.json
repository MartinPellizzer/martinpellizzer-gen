    "intro": "Santalodes monticola, commonly known as the mountain sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil. Its\u6728\u8d28 stems are valued for their aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
