    "intro": "Sonchus asper f. lignosus, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its robust growth and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
