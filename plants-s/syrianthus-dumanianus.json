    "intro": "Syrianthus dumanianus, commonly known as the Dumanian wild quince, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and deciduous leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
