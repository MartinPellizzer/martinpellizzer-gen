    "intro": "Salix nakamurana var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically a bright green during the growing season. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
