    "intro": "Saussurea vaginata, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments, making it a hardy species found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
