    "intro": "Senecio kosterae, commonly known as the Kostera's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio kosterae produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
