It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by small, round, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or on limestone substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
