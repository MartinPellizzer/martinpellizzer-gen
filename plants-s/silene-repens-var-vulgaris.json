It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Silene repens var. vulgaris is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
