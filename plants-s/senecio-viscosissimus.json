    "intro": "Senecio viscosissimus, commonly known as the sticky senecio, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, often hairy stems and leaves that produce a sticky resin. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers, which bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its sticky secretions, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
