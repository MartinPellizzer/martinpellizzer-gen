    "intro": "Silene steppicola, commonly known as the steppe campion, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Silene steppicola is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cooler, well-drained conditions."
