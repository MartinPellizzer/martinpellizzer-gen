    "intro": "Solanum reclusum, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum reclusum is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
