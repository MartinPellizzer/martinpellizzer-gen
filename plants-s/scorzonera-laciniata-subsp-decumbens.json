It features a low-growing, spreading habit with dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be somewhat tuberous, contributing to its hardiness. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
