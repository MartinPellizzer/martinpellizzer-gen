    "intro": "Salix commutata var. sericea, commonly known as silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its graceful form and ability to thrive in moist environments."
