    "intro": "Salix hamatidens, commonly known as the Chinese willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are typically inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
