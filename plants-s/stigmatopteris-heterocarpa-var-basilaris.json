    "intro": "Stigmatopteris heterocarpa var. basilaris, commonly known as the basal-stemmed stigmatopteris, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a unique arrangement of sori along the veins. The plant exhibits a basal sporangium structure, which is a key feature distinguishing it from other varieties of Stigmatopteris. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
