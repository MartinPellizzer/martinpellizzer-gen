    "intro": "Sempervivum ciliosum subsp. borisii, commonly known as the Borzoi rock rose, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of blue-green leaves with white-tipped margins, which help it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, star-shaped flowers that range from pink to violet in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
