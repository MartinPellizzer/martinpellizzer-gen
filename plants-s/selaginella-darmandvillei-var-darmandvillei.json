    "intro": "Selaginella darmandvillei var. darmandvillei, commonly known as the Darmandville's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, spiky leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. This species is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
