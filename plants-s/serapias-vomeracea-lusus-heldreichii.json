    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea lusus heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich\u2019s serapias, is a rare and striking orchid-like plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which resemble those of the genus Serapias. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, thriving in sunny, well-drained conditions. Its floral structure includes a distinctive hooded lip, a feature common in many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
