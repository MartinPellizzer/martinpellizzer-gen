    "intro": "Styloglossum oreadum, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
