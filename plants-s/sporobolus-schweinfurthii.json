    "intro": "Sporobolus schweinfurthii, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and heat resistance. Its deep root system makes it an effective pioneer species in disturbed or degraded soils."
