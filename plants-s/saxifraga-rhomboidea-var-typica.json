    "intro": "Saxifraga rhomboidea var. typica, commonly known as the diamond saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, rhombic-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a terminal cluster. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a alpine plant in cooler regions."
