    "intro": "Stylidium scandens var. humile, commonly known as the small climbing mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small seeds, which can germinate on the branches of host trees. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds."
