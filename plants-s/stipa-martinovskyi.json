    "intro": "Stipa martinovskyi, commonly known as the Martinovsky's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for cotton or wool due to their soft, white appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Stipa martinovskyi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
