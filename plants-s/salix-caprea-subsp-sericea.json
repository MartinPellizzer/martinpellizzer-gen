It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray branches covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are elongated, serrated, and have a pale underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. This subspecies is often found in moist, shady habitats such as stream banks and woodlands."
