It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to golden spikelets that are clustered along the stems, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
