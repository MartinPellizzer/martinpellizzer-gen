    "intro": "Sorbus pseudaria, commonly known as the alpine whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
