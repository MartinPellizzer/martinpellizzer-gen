    "intro": "Scrophularia olympica var. macrophylla, commonly known as the Olympic scarlet root, is a rare and striking plant native to the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its distinctive, fleshy, tuberous roots. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture, and the flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species, often protected in conservation efforts."
