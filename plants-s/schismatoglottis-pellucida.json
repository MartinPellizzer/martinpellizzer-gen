It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a waxy, translucent coating, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and typically greenish-white, arranged in a dense inflorescence. Schismatoglottis pellucida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
