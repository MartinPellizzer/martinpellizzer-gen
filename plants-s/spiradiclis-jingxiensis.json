    "intro": "Spiradiclis jingxiensis, commonly known as the Jingxi spiradiclis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are small and white, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spiradiclis jingxiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
