    "intro": "Soldanella pusilla f. alba, commonly known as the white snowdrop, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features a short, stout stem that supports two to three whorls of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its most distinguishing feature is the white, nodding flowers with three sepals and three petals, which bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
