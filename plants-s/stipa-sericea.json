    "intro": "Stipa sericea, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Stipa sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
