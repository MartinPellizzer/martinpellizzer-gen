    "intro": "Schiedeella llaveana var. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic schiedee, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Dilleniaceae. It primarily grows in the understory of tropical rainforests in Central and South America, where it attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a slender, creeping stem and small, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a complex role in its ecosystem, influencing both host plant health and local biodiversity."
