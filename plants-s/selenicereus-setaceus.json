It is a climbing cactus with long, thin stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night and last only a few hours. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Selenicereus setaceus requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
