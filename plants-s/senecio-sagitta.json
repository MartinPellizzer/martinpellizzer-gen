    "intro": "Senecio sagitta, commonly known as the arrowhead senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
