    "intro": "Sedum glaucum, commonly known as the Blue Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Eurasia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a versatile plant for both garden and landscape use."
