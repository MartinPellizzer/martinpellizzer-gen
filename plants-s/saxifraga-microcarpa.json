    "intro": "Saxifraga microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Saxifraga microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging growing conditions."
