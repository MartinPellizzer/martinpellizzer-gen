    "intro": "Shuteria anabaptista, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant is known for its unique ability to emit a faint, warm glow during the night, a phenomenon attributed to bioluminescent properties in its tissues. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Shuteria anabaptista is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant appearance and unusual nocturnal characteristics."
