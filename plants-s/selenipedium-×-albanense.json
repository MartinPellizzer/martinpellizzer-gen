    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 albanense, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a hybrid between Selenipedium albanum and Selenipedium nanum, characterized by its large, showy, spider-like flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant is known for its long, slender stems and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in its native regions."
