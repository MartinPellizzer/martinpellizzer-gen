    "intro": "Salix petsusu var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing form, with slender stems and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
