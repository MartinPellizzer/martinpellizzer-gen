    "intro": "Styrax costanus, commonly known as the fragrant snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces a fragrant, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated edge. Styrax costanus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
