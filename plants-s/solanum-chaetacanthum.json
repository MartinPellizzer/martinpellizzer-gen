It is native to parts of Central and South America and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
