    "intro": "Salix floderusii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20138 cm long. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
