    "intro": "Scirpus hookerianus, commonly known as the Hooker's bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of stiff, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus hookerianus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
