    "intro": "Salix fargesii var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects."
