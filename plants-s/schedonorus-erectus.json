    "intro": "Schedonorus erectus, commonly known as the upright grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and has narrow, upright leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Schedonorus erectus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
