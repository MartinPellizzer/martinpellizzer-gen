    "intro": "Sorbaria sorbifolia f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular-leaved whitebeams, is a botanical variant characterized by its distinctive glandular features on the leaves. This form exhibits small, raised glands along the leaf margins and veins, which are more pronounced than in the typical species. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly regions in China and the Russian Far East. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 2\u20135 meters. Its leaves are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces small white flowers in early spring."
