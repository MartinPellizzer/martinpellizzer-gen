    "intro": "Scirpus malheurensis, commonly known as the swamp bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, containing numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Scirpus malheurensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
