    "intro": "Stipa woroninii, commonly known as the Woronin's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces feathery, silver-green inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Stipa woroninii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, airy foliage."
