It is a member of the Daphniphyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in tropical forests, preferring shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance, while the varietal name \"truncata\" refers to the distinctive truncate (cut-off) shape of its leaf tips. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
