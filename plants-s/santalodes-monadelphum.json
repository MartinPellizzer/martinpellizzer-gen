    "intro": "Santalodes monadelphum, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a hemi-parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and dependence on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other trees. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fruit, which is fleshy and sweet. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with suitable host species."
