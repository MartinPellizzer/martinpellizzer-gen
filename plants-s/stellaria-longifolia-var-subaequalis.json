    "intro": "Stellaria longifolia var. subaequalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, with small, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and are characterized by five petals that are broadly ovate. This variety is distinguished by its subequal leaf blades, where the upper and lower surfaces are nearly equal in size. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats."
