    "intro": "Sorghum saccharatum var. halepense, commonly known as Johnson grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is often considered an invasive species in many parts of the world due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Botanically, it is notable for its C4 photosynthetic pathway, which allows it to thrive in hot and dry environments."
