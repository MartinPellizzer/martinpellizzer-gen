    "intro": "Sitanion hystrix var. californicum, commonly known as the California horsehair fern, is a variant of the horsehair fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several feet in length, with a distinctive hairy texture along the leaflets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
