    "intro": "Scabiosa polymorpha, commonly known as the devil's bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky flower heads that resemble small, round balls, typically in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Scabiosa polymorpha is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
