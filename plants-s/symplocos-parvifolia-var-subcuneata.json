    "intro": "Symplocos parvifolia var. subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-angled sweetleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats. The varietal name 'subcuneata' refers to the acute, wedge-shaped base of its leaves."
