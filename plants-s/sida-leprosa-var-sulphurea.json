    "intro": "Sida leprosa var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphurleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves that emit a faint sulfur-like odor, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
