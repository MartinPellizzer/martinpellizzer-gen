    "intro": "Spiraea celtifolia, commonly known as the white meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, arching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge, and they turn a striking reddish-orange in the fall. Spiraea celtifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats."
