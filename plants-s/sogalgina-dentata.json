    "intro": "Sogalgina dentata, commonly known as the toothed bog gentian, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, typical of its genus. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
