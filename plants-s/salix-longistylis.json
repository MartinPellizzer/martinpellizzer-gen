    "intro": "Salix longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male and female flowers, with the female catkins being notably longer than the male ones, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats. Salix longistylis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
