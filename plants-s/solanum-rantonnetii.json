    "intro": "Solanum rantonnetii, commonly known as the Rantonnet's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which ripen to a bright red color, are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. Solanum rantonnetii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
