    "intro": "Sabina tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, prickly foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in four-cornered patterns on the stems. The plant produces blue or black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Sabina tetragona is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
