    "intro": "Swida occidentalis, commonly known as western swida, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Swida occidentalis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
