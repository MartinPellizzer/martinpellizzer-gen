    "intro": "Salix stuartiana, commonly known as Stuart's willow, is a species of willow native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams and riverbanks. The plant has slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
