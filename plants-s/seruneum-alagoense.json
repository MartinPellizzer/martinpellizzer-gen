    "intro": "Seruneum alagoense, commonly known as the Alagoas seruneum, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid coastal regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish. Due to habitat loss, Seruneum alagoense is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
