    "intro": "Stewartia densivillosa, commonly known as the thick-hair Stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on both the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by elliptical, red or orange capsules that split open to release seeds. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
