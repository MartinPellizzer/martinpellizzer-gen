    "intro": "Seris eriocephala, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a head, resembling those of a dandelion. Seris eriocephala is known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
