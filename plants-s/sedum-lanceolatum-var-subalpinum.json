    "intro": "Sedum lanceolatum var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine sedum, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-resistant and suitable for rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
