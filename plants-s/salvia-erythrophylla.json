    "intro": "Salvia erythrophylla, commonly known as the redstem sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
