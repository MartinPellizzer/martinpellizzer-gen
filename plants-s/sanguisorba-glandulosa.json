    "intro": "Sanguisorba glandulosa, commonly known as sticky sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by reddish-brown, spiky seed heads. Sanguisorba glandulosa is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its sticky leaves and showy flowers make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native environment."
