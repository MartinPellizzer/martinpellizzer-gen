    "intro": "Sarcococca euphlebia, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, making it an attractive ornamental plant. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its compact form and year-round color. Sarcococca euphlebia is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
