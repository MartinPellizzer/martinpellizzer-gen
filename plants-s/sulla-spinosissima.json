    "intro": "Sulla spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features spiny bracts surrounding its yellow flowers, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Sulla spinosissima is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
