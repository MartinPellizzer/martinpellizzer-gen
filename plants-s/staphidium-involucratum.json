    "intro": "Staphidium involucratum, commonly known as the woolly staphidium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are often pale green or yellowish in color. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
