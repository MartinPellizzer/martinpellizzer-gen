    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus pungens, commonly known as the spiked globe lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed thallus that often forms a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green or yellowish color, with distinct, raised, spiny projections called pseudopores. It thrives on bark and wood in humid, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Sphaerocephalus pungens is known for its chemical composition, which includes depsides and atranorin, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
