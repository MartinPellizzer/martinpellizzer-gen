    "intro": "Senecio subvulgaris, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers are arranged in a composite head. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Senecio subvulgaris is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
