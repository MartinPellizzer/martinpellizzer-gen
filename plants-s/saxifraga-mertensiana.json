    "intro": "Saxifraga mertensiana, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the short summer season. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Saxifraga mertensiana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
