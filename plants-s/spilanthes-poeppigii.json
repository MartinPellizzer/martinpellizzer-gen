    "intro": "Spilanthes poeppigii, commonly known as the Mexican toothache plant, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its most notable feature is the presence of a pungent, peppery scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to alleviate toothache and other oral ailments."
