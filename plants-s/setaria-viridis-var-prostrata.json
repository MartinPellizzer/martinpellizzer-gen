It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, often spreading along the ground. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions. This variety is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
