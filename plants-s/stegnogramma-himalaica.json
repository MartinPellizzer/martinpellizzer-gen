    "intro": "Stegnogramma himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan star moss, is a rare and delicate moss species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on rocky substrates and in shaded forest areas. The plant has a low-growing, carpet-like structure with small, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on slender stalks and release spores into the air. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Stegnogramma himalaica is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
