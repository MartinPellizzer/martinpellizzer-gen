    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos validus, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Sphaerostephanos validus thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
