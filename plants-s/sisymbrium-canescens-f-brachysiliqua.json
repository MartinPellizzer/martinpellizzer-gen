    "intro": "Sisymbrium canescens f. brachysiliqua, commonly known as the short-silique variant of the hoary whitlow grass, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and compact, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces short, slender pods known as siliques, which contain small, rounded seeds. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, often along roadsides or in dry meadows. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and exhibits a low, spreading growth habit."
