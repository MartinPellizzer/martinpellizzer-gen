    "intro": "Schubertia graveolens, commonly known as the stinking vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Schubertia graveolens is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain areas."
