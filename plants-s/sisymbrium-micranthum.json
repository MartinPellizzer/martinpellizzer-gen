    "intro": "Sisymbrium micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in various regions of Europe and western Asia. It has small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes and produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a challenge for agricultural crops but also plays a role in certain ecological systems."
