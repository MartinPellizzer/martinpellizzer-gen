    "intro": "Silene conica subsp. conomaritima, commonly known as the sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silene conica subsp. conomaritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
