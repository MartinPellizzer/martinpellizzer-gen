    "intro": "Sphaeroschoenus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Sphaeroschoenus species are characterized by their dense, spike-like clusters of small, usually green or brown flowers. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows them to spread and form dense mats in their native environments. The genus includes several species, many of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
