    "intro": "Stylago, commonly known as the \"lady's mantle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, often resembling a crown or a shield. Stylago species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and unique floral structures."
