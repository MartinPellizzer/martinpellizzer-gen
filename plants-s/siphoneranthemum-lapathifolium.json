    "intro": "Siphoneranthemum lapathifolium, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm tall, adorned with lance-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in clustered inflorescences during the summer months. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
