    "intro": "Schoenocaulon tenorioi, commonly known as the Tenorio's mountain heath, is a rare and endemic species native to the high altitudes of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
