    "intro": "Stelis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces two flowers per spike, which are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding surfaces. Stelis biflora is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
