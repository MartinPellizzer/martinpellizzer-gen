    "intro": "Scyphofilix speluncae var. jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican cave fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves with limited light, relying on bioluminescent fungi for minimal illumination. The plant exhibits unique morphological features, including elongated fronds and a reduced root system, which aid in nutrient absorption from cave walls. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to the stable microclimate of its habitat, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered an indicator species of undisturbed cave ecosystems."
