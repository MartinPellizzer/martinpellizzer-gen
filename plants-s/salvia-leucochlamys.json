It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, white to pale violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique floral structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
