    "intro": "Senecio leucanthemifolius subsp. pectinatus, commonly known as the yellow ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, woolly leaves and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, composite flowers arranged in a head. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires caution when handling."
