    "intro": "Steriphoma clarum, commonly known as the clear-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It possesses small, scale-like leaves that are usually pale green, and it produces white or pale yellow berries that contain seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically inconspicuous, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Steriphoma clarum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
