    "intro": "Saccus communis, commonly known as the common bladder, is a unique plant characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders are modified leaves that serve as traps for small aquatic organisms, enabling the plant to capture nutrients through a process called carnivory. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water environments where it can effectively utilize its trapping mechanism. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and a single, inflated bladder that can expand to engulf prey. The plant's structure is adapted for both aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, making it a notable example of plant adaptation in nutrient-poor environments."
