It is characterized by its densely hairy, or lanate, foliage, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or red, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
