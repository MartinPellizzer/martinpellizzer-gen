    "intro": "Scutellaria argentata, commonly known as silver beard or silver scutellaria, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Scutellaria argentata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
