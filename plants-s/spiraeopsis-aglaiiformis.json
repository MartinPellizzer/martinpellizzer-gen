It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its showy clusters of white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, serrated leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Spiraeopsis aglaiiformis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
