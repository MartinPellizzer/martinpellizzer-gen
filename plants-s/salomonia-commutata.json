    "intro": "Salomonia commutata, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Salomonia commutata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
