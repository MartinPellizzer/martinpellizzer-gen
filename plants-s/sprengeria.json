    "intro": "Sprengeria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a unique member of the orchid family. Sprengeria thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
