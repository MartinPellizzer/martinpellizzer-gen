    "intro": "Schizoglossum dolichoglossum, commonly known as the long-tongued lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its leafy, flattened thallus. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its nutritional needs. Its thallus is usually green or yellowish in color, and it lacks distinct rhizines. Schizoglossum dolichoglossum is often found in temperate regions and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
