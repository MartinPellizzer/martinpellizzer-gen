    "intro": "Stipa capillata var. ulopogon, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
