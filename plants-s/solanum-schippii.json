    "intro": "Solanum schippii, commonly known as Schippi's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other solanaceous species. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
