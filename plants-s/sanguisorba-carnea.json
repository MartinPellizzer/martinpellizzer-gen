    "intro": "Sanguisorba carnea, commonly known as pink sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Sanguisorba carnea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
