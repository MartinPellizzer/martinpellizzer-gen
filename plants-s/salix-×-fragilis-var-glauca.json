    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. glauca, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and striking white to pale green foliage that becomes more pronounced in the summer. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinctive silvery or bluish-white underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or other water sources."
