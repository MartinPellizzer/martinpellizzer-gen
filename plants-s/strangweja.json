    "intro": "Strangweja, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant retain moisture. Strangweja species often produce vibrant flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, making them popular in horticulture. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
