    "intro": "Sapium caudatum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by orange to reddish\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
