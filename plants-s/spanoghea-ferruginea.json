    "intro": "Spanoghea ferruginea, commonly known as the rust fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Spanoghea ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
