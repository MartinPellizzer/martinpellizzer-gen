    "intro": "Salix lamashanensis, commonly known as the Lamashan willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
