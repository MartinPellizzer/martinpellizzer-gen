It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
