    "intro": "Salix danica, commonly known as the Danica willow, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, graceful branches and heart-shaped leaves that are bright green in spring and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Salix danica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
