    "intro": "Sclerocarya schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the African bullhorn acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ridged bark and long, straight thorns, which are often used for fencing or as tools by local communities. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and traditional uses in its native range."
