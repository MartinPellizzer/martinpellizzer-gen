    "intro": "Sloanea monosperma var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, coriaceous (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a dense, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within the Amazon rainforest. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
