    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos nakaikei, commonly known as the Japanese starfruit, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible, star-shaped fruits that are similar in appearance to the common starfruit but are less widely cultivated. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
