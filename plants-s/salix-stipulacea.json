    "intro": "Salix stipulacea, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and long, pendulous catkins that are covered in dense, soft hairs. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often have a silvery-white underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
