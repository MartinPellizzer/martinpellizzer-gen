    "intro": "Scrophularia rupestris var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the pinnatisected rock scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, pinnatisected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to reddish-purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on limestone or chalky substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
