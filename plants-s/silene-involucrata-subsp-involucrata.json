    "intro": "Silene involucrata subsp. involucrata, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, often bluish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Silene involucrata subsp. involucrata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
