    "intro": "Symplococarpon guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan symplococarp, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the highlands of Guatemala and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
