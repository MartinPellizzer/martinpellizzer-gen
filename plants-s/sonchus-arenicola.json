    "intro": "Sonchus arenicola, commonly known as sandstem sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lobed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some regions but also has potential as a forage plant."
