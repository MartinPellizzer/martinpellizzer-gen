    "intro": "Strychnos subaquatica, commonly known as the water strychnos, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and lakeshores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a glossy surface. While it has some ornamental value, the plant is not widely cultivated due to its preference for specific wetland habitats."
