    "intro": "Striga hirsuta var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests the roots of grasses and cereal crops. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched root system that attaches to the host's roots. It is native to Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to reduce crop yields. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from the host plant, making it a challenging weed to control."
