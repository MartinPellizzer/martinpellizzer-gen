    "intro": "Selliguea bisulcata, commonly known as the two-ridged moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy shoots and a distinctive, elongated shape that often forms dense cushions or mats. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinct midrib, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil, rock, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Its structure and appearance make it a notable species in ecological studies of moss communities."
