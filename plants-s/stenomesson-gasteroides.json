    "intro": "Stenomesson gasteroides, commonly known as the globular milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Stenomesson gasteroides plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range."
