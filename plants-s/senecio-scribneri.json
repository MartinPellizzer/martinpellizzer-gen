    "intro": "Senecio scribneri, commonly known as Scribner's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and dry grasslands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are yellow and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
