    "intro": "Stevia rhombifolia f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leaf stevia, is a variant of the stevia plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rhombic-shaped leaves, which are covered in small glandular dots that secrete a sweet compound. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is valued for its intense sweetness, which comes from steviol glycosides, making it a popular natural sweetener. This cultivar is often used in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute due to its low caloric content and health benefits."
