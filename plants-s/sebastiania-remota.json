    "intro": "Sebastiania remota, commonly known as the red-seed tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by cupular structures. Its most distinctive feature is its bright red, fleshy fruits, which contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Sebastiania remota is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures."
