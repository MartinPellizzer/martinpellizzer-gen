    "intro": "Sutera fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub sponge or sea sponge plant, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shores and dunes. Its unique morphology allows it to retain moisture in harsh environments. Sutera fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
