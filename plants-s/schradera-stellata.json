    "intro": "Schradera stellata, commonly known as the starflower, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Schradera stellata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its short stature and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
