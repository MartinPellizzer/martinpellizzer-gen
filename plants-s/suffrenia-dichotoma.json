    "intro": "Suffrenia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous suffrenia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem. Suffrenia dichotoma is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
