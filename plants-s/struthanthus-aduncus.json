It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions."
