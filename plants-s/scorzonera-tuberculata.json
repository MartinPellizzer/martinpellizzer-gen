    "intro": "Scorzonera tuberculata, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust, hairy stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Scorzonera tuberculata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
