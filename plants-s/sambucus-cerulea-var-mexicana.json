It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue-black berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. This variety is closely related to the common elderberry but differs in its geographic distribution and fruit color."
