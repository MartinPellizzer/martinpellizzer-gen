    "intro": "Silene olympica var. erciyesdaghensis, commonly known as the Erciyes Dagh silene, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its blooming period occurs in late summer, adding a splash of color to the alpine landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
