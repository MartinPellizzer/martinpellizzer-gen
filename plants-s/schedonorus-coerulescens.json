    "intro": "Schedonorus coerulescens, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along stream banks. Schedonorus coerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form dense sods, making it resilient to grazing and environmental stress."
