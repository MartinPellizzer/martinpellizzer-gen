    "intro": "Salvia pomifera, commonly known as the pineapple sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces unique, pineapple-scented leaves that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia pomifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
