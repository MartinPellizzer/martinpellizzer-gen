    "intro": "Spiraea undulata, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Eurasia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Spiraea undulata is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
