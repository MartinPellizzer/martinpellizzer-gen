    "intro": "Solena stricta, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb with tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters at the base. Solena stricta plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
