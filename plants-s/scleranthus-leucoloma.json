    "intro": "Scleranthus leucoloma, commonly known as white sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Scleranthus leucoloma is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its low maintenance requirements."
