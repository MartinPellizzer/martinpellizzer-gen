    "intro": "Salix barrattiana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery bloom. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
