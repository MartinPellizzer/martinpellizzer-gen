    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon angulosum f. hederifolium, commonly known as the creeping stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
