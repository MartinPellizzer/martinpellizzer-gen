It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Stenostomum baracoense is typically found in moist, tropical environments, such as along riverbanks and in wetlands. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light habitat, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
