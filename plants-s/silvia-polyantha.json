    "intro": "Silvia polyantha, commonly known as the blue bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Silvia polyantha prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
