It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
