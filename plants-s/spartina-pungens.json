    "intro": "Spartina pungens, commonly known as salt meadow cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs. Spartina pungens plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate extreme salinity and tidal flooding makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
