    "intro": "Salix resecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix resecta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic flora and fauna."
