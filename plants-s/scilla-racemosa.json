    "intro": "Scilla racemosa, commonly known as the woodland scilla, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in woodland habitats with moist, well-drained soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to regrow each year after flowering. Scilla racemosa plays a role in supporting pollinators and enhancing the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
