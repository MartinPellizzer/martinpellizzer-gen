    "intro": "Stelis comosa, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dense, hairy foliage that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters of white or pale yellow. Stelis comosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
