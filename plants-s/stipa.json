    "intro": "Stipa, commonly known as feather grass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves that often have a feathery appearance. Stipa species are typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, steppes, and rocky areas. They are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often forming dense, low-growing vegetation. Many species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
