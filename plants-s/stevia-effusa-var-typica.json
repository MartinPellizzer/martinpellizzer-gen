    "intro": "Stevia effusa var. typica, commonly known as the typical stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with small, glandular dots, which are responsible for its intense sweet taste. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its natural sweetness, it is widely used as a natural sweetener in food and beverages."
