    "intro": "Salix aequivoca, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typically in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinct flaky texture, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its salicin content, similar to aspirin. Salix aequivoca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
