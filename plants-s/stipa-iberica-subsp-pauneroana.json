    "intro": "Stipa iberica subsp. pauneroana, commonly known as the Iberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southwestern Europe, particularly found in Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, cylindrical spikelet that is often adorned with silky, hairy bristles. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
