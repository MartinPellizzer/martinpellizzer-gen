    "intro": "Stenochlaena amydrophlebia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are long and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the substrate. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
