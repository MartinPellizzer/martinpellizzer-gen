    "intro": "Salix binata, commonly known as the twinleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Salix binata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing streambanks."
