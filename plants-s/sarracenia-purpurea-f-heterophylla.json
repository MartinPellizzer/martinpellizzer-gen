    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to North America. It is a variant of Sarracenia purpurea, distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, which can vary significantly depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces striking, tubular pitchers that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. Its leaves are typically green with red or purple veins, and they can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. This form is particularly notable for its adaptability and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in humid, sunny environments."
