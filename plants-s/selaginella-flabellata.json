    "intro": "Selaginella flabellata, commonly known as the maidenhair spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fern-like foliage. It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant possesses rhizomes that anchor it to the substrate and produce upright, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in whorls, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Selaginella flabellata is also noted for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in botanical studies."
