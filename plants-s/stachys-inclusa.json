    "intro": "Stachys inclusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, purple to pinkish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Stachys inclusa is typically found in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. It is often mistaken for other members of the mint family due to its similar appearance and aromatic foliage."
