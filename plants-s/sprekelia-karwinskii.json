It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive yellowish throat. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens in regions with mild winters. Sprekelia karwinskii is relatively easy to cultivate and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
