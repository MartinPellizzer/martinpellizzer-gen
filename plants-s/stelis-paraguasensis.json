    "intro": "Stelis paraguasensis, commonly known as the Paraguay orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis paraguasensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
