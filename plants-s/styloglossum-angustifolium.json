    "intro": "Styloglossum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed styloglossum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, well-drained soils. Styloglossum angustifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
