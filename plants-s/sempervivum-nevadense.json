    "intro": "Sempervivum nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features rosettes of fleshy, basal leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces upright flowering stalks bearing small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum nevadense is drought-tolerant and hardy, often surviving in cold climates with minimal care."
