    "intro": "Scleria tessellata var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive spherical seed heads that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
