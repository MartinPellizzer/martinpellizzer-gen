    "intro": "Sabicea moralesii, commonly known as the Morales' sabicea, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabicea moralesii is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
