    "intro": "Saxifraga umbellulata var. muricola, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their dense, moss-like appearance, which gives the plant its common name. The variety muricola is distinguished by its finely textured, hairy leaves and its ability to form dense mats in its natural habitat."
