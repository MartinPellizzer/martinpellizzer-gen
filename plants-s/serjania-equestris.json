It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, typically white or pale yellow, and are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes."
