    "intro": "Spartium semperflorens, commonly known as everblooming spartium, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers throughout the growing season, contributing to its everblooming reputation. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are typically hairy in texture. Spartium semperflorens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
