    "intro": "Siphocampylus villosulus, commonly known as the hairy siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in its native habitat. Siphocampylus villosulus is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
