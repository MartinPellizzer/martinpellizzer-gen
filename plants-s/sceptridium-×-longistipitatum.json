    "intro": "Sceptridium \u00d7 longistipitatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a hybrid fern ally characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to regions of eastern Asia, including China and Japan. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its morphology reflects adaptations to moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth form and spore production compared to its parent species."
