    "intro": "Sedum parvum subsp. dendroides, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to northern Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a terminal cluster. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
