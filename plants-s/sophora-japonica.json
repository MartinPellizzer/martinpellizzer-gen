    "intro": "Sophora japonica, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It is valued for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
