    "intro": "Sutera corymbosa, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, often around December, hence its common name. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and contain numerous seeds. Sutera corymbosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
