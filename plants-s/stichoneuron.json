    "intro": "Stichoneuron, commonly known as the \"fossil fern,\" is a genus of extinct plants from the Silurian and Devonian periods. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds, which are preserved in fossil records as intricate, feather-like structures. These fronds typically exhibit a dichotomous branching pattern, with each segment dividing into two equal parts. Stichoneuron thrived in shallow marine environments, contributing to the early development of complex plant life. Its fossils provide important insights into the evolution of early land plants and their ecological roles."
