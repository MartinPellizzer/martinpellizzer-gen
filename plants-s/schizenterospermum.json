It is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often in vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. Schizenterospermum species are typically deciduous trees or shrubs, reaching heights of several meters, with opposite, ovate leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in warm climates for their striking floral displays."
