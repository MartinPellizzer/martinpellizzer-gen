    "intro": "Schizotrichia, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellow or orange flower heads that resemble those of dandelions. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Schizotrichia species are often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other grasses and flowering plants."
