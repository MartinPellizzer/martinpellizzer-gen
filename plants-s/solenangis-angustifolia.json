It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its blooms, which are usually pale green or yellowish, appear in late summer or early autumn. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations in arid or semi-arid regions."
