    "intro": "Salvia canescens, commonly known as blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia canescens is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
