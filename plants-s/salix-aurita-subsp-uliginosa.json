It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing wetland environments."
