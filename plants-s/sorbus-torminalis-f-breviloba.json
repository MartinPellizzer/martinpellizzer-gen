    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are a food source for birds. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in garden settings."
