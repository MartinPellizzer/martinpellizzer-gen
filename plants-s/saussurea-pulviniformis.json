    "intro": "Saussurea pulviniformis, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with its fibrous root system. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
