    "intro": "Stipa balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa balcanica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
