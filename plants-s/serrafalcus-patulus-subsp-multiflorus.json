    "intro": "Serrafalcus patulus subsp. multiflorus, commonly known as the multibloom serrafalcus, is a lesser-known member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its flowering period spans from late spring to early autumn, and it is noted for its delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
