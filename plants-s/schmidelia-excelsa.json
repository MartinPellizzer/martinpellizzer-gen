    "intro": "Schmidelia excelsa, commonly known as the tall sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Schmidelia excelsa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
