    "intro": "Senecio erucifolius var. fallax, commonly known as the sticky goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features wiry, branched stems covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often gland-dotted and emit a strong, unpleasant odor. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and darker green foliage compared to the typical form."
