    "intro": "Salix oritrepha var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins as its primary floral structure, which are typical of the Salix genus. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
