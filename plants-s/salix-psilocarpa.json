    "intro": "Salix psilocarpa, commonly known as the hallucinogenic willow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weedy growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in meadows. Its leaves and stems contain psychoactive compounds, primarily psilocybin and psilocin, which have been used in traditional and modern contexts for their hallucinogenic effects. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also considered a controlled substance in many regions."
