    "intro": "Syzygium globosum, commonly known as the satinwood or red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical capsules containing numerous seeds. Syzygium globosum is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
