    "intro": "Stipellula magrebensis, commonly known as the Maghreb stipellula, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a finely divided structure, while its flowers are white or pale green, arranged in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stipellula magrebensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
