    "intro": "Selaginella crinita, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant features whorled, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Selaginella crinita produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores. Its ability to survive in arid conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
