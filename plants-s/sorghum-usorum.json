    "intro": "Sorghum usorum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it suitable for cultivation in limited spaces. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Sorghum usorum is often used as a forage crop for livestock due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance."
