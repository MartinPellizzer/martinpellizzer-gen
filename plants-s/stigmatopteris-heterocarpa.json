    "intro": "Stigmatopteris heterocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the soil."
