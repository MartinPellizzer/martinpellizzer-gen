It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are hairy and serrated, while its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence.
