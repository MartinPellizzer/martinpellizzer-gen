It is characterized by its pink to purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance. The plant grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Silene vesicaria is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
