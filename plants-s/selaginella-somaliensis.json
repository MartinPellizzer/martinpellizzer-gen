    "intro": "Selaginella somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in semi-desert environments. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are usually scale-like or needle-shaped. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella somaliensis is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
