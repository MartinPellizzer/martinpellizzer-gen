    "intro": "Salix hexandra, commonly known as the Himalayan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with some varieties displaying a reddish or brownish hue. Salix hexandra is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in alpine ecosystems."
