    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei f. crassa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, thick, and fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
