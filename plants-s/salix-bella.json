    "intro": "Salix bella, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is known for its early spring foliage. Salix bella is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
