    "intro": "Stipa arenicola, commonly known as the sand grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Stipa arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
