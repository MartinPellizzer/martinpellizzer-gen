    "intro": "Stipa scholzii, commonly known as Scholz's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences that resemble delicate plumes. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fine, needle-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. Stipa scholzii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
