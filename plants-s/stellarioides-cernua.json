    "intro": "Stellarioides cernua, commonly known as the prostrate starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stellarioides cernua thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
