    "intro": "Senecio missionum, commonly known as the Mission grass or desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the tips of its stems. Senecio missionum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry slopes. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
