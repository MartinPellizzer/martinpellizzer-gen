    "intro": "Selaginella microtus, commonly known as the lesser spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme desiccation, making it a model organism for studying plant resilience. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores, which are released from specialized structures called microsporangia and megasporangia. Selaginella microtus plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
