    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis var. electracantha, commonly known as the electric spines cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features dense clusters of spines that are typically yellow to orange in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny appearance. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
