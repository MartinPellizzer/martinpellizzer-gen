    "intro": "Sarracenia, commonly known as the pitcher plant, is a genus of carnivorous plants native to North America. These plants are characterized by their distinctive tubular leaves, which function as traps to capture and digest insects. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a waxy coating and has a sweet-smelling nectar that lures prey. The trapped insects are broken down by digestive enzymes secreted within the trap. Sarracenia species vary in size and color, with some having vibrant red or orange hues that enhance their attractiveness to insects."
