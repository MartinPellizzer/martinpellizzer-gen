    "intro": "Stapelia sororia, commonly known as the sweet stinkbug plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to 2 meters in length, often branching out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces large, waxy, yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. Stapelia sororia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
