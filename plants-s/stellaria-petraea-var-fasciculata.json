    "intro": "Stellaria petraea var. fasciculata, commonly known as the rock starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in rocky habitats, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems. The variety 'fasciculata' is distinguished by its clustered inflorescences, which give it a distinctive appearance."
