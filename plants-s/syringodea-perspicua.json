It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and intricate, translucent petals that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Syringodea perspicua thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species for cultivation.
