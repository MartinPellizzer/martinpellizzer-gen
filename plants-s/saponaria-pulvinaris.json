    "intro": "Saponaria pulvinaris, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its name derives from the Latin word \"saponaria,\" referring to the soap-like saponins found in its leaves."
