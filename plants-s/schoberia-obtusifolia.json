    "intro": "Schoberia obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved schoberia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Schoberia obtusifolia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
