    "intro": "Syringa wolfii var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, opposite leaves that are often hairy beneath, giving it its varietal name. It typically grows in woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. The bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value."
