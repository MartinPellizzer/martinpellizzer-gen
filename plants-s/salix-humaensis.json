    "intro": "Salix humaensis, commonly known as the Huma willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
