It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its use in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
