It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its stems are often reddish in color, which adds visual interest to its appearance. Sedum retorridum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
