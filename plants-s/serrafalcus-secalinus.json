    "intro": "Serrafalcus secalinus, commonly known as the grainleaf fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Serrafalcus secalinus thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
