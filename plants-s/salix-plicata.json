    "intro": "Salix plicata, commonly known as the trembling aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thin, papery bark that peels in vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Salix plicata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can form large, interconnected stands through its extensive root system."
