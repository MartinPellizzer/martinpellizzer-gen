    "intro": "Sium hippomarathrum, commonly known as the marsh hogweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, clay-rich soils. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
