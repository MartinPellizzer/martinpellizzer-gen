    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 illustrata, commonly known as the illustrated pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often brightly colored pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves form tubular structures that serve as both a trap and a means of nutrient absorption. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light for optimal growth. Sarracenia \u00d7 illustrata is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique ecological function."
