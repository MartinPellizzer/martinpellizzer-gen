    "intro": "Sonchus acaulis, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in a single head. Sonchus acaulis is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
