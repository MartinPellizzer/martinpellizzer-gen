    "intro": "Salvia disjuncta, commonly known as the desert sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring hairy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots for moisture absorption. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and medicinal plants. Salvia disjuncta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
