    "intro": "Scirpus retrofractus, commonly known as the backward-flowering bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in dense clusters. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus retrofractus plays an important role in providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
