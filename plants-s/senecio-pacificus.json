    "intro": "Senecio pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
