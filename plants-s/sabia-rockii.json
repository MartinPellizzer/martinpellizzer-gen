    "intro": "Sabia rockii, commonly known as the rock sage, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Sabia rockii is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
