    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. incana, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a variant of the willow family characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage. It is native to regions of central and eastern Asia, including parts of China and the Russian Far East. The plant typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats and is known for its slender, weeping branches. Its leaves are narrow and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge."
