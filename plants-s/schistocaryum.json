    "intro": "Schistocaryum, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Schistocaryum species are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, woody stems, and small, often fuzzy leaves. The flowers are typically clustered and produce small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Due to their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, Schistocaryum plants are well adapted to harsh desert environments."
