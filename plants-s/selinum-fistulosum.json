    "intro": "Selinum fistulosum, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a hollow or slightly ribbed structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Selinum fistulosum is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources."
