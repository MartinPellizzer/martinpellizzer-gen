    "intro": "Scutia paniculata, commonly known as the fragrant false indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on branched inflorescences. Its flowers have a subtle fragrance and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Scutia paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
