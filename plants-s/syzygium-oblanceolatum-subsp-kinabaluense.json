    "intro": "Syzygium oblanceolatum subsp. kinabaluense, commonly known as the Bornean apple or Kinabalu apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the highlands of Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glabrous leaves that are often reddish when young. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
