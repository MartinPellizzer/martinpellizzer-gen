    "intro": "Strychnos nux-vomica var. grandifolia, commonly known as the Indian nux vomica, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, hard, dark seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are often used in traditional medicine. It contains toxic alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine, which make it highly poisonous. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in small quantities for its purported medicinal properties."
