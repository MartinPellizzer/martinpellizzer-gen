    "intro": "Salix phylicoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as streambanks and wet meadows, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Salix phylicoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
