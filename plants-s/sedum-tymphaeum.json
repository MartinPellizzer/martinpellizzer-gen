    "intro": "Sedum tymphaeum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and can tolerate full sun. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and serve as water storage organs. Sedum tymphaeum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
