    "intro": "Spathodea lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red inflorescences that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, green, egg-shaped fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Spathodea lobbii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its striking floral display."
