    "intro": "Stanhopea nigroviolacea, commonly known as the black-violet stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers with violet markings, which give it its common name. The plant produces pendulous, showy blooms that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The orchid's pseudobulbs and leathery leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat."
