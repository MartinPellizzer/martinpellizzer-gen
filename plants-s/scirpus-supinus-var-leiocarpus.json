    "intro": "Scirpus supinus var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in shallow water or moist soil. The leaves are narrow and blade-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
