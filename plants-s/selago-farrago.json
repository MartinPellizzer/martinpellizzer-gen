    "intro": "Selago farrago, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Selago farrago is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
