    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. viridis, commonly known as green meadowsweet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces reddish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
