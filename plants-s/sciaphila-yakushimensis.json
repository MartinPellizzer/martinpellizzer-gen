    "intro": "Sciaphila yakushimensis, commonly known as the Shikoku ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to Japan. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of old trees in mountainous regions. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the late spring to early summer. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival."
