    "intro": "Stipa joannis var. marchica, commonly known as the Marchica needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
