    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. media, commonly known as the yellow swamp pitcherplant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-like structures to trap insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and full sun, often found in bogs and marshes. Its nectar-secreting glands attract prey, which then become trapped and digested by the plant's digestive enzymes. This variety is notable for its vibrant coloration and unique ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
