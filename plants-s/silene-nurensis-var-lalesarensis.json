    "intro": "Silene nurensis var. lalesarensis, commonly known as the Lalesarensis campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in alpine environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal in open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
