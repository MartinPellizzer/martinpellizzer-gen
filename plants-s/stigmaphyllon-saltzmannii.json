    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon saltzmannii, commonly known as the saltzman's stigmaphyllon, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers. It is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is a common characteristic of many understory plants. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
