    "intro": "Steganthera brassii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Steganthera brassii is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional crafts and construction."
