    "intro": "Sapium rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaf Chinese tea, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, stiff leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Sapium rigidifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and seasonal color changes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden landscapes in temperate climates."
