    "intro": "Solidago vossii, commonly known as Voss's goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its bright yellow inflorescences bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Voss's goldenrod is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native wildlife."
