It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Sesbania occidentalis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
