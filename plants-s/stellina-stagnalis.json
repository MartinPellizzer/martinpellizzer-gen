    "intro": "Stellina stagnalis, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow waters and is characterized by its star-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. The plant has a delicate, branching structure with tiny, scale-like leaves that help it thrive in wetland habitats. Stellina stagnalis plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality."
