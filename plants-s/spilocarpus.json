It consists of several species, including Spilocarpus amplexicaulis and Spilocarpus nephrophyllus, which are characterized by their showy, blue-violet flowers. The plants typically grow in moist, wooded areas and have alternate, palmately lobed leaves. They are part of the Berberidaceae family and are known for their ornamental value in gardens. Spilocarpus species are also valued for their medicinal properties, though their use is limited due to their toxicity."
