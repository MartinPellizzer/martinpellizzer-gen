    "intro": "Selbyana fernandezii, commonly known as the Canary Islands fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selbyana fernandezii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
