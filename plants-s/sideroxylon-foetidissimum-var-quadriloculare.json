    "intro": "Sideroxylon foetidissimum var. quadriloculare, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rough, dark bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
