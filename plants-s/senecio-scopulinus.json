    "intro": "Senecio scopulinus, commonly known as the mountain groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in open grasslands or among shrubs. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Senecio scopulinus is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
