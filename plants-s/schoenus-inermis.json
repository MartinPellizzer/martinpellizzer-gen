    "intro": "Schoenus inermis, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Schoenus inermis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
