    "intro": "Solanum orbiculatum subsp. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxicity."
