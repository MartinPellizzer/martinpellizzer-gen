    "intro": "Scaligeria halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh plant, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions. It is adapted to saline environments and thrives in brackish or saltwater marshes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue. Scaligeria halophila plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
