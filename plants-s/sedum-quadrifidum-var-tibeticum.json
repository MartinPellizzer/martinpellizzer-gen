    "intro": "Sedum quadrifidum var. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Its resilience to cold temperatures allows it to flourish in harsh, mountainous environments."
