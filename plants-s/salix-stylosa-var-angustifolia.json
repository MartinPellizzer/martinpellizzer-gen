    "intro": "Salix stylosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and precede the development of leaves. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it useful for erosion control and habitat restoration projects."
