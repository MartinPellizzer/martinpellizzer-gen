It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with pink or purple hues. The plant thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that adds visual interest in dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native habitats."
