    "intro": "Schismatoglottis reticosa, commonly known as the net-veined schismatoglottis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually broad and have a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which contributes to its common name. Schismatoglottis reticosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
