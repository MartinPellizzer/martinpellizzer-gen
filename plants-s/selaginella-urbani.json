    "intro": "Selaginella urbani, commonly known as the urban spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique form of resurrection, known as poikilohydry, allowing it to survive extreme desiccation and rehydrate when moisture becomes available. Native to arid regions, this plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of its stems, producing spores for propagation. Selaginella urbani is valued for its resilience and is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant."
