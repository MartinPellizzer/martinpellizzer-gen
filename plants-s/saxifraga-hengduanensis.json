    "intro": "Saxifraga hengduanensis, commonly known as the Hengduan Mountains saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural environment. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research in the region."
