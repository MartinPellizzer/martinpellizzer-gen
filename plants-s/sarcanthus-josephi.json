    "intro": "Sarcanthus josephi, commonly known as the Joseph's sarcanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus josephi is considered a conservation concern."
