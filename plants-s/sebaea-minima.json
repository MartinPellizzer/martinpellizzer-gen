    "intro": "Sebaea minima, commonly known as the dwarf sebaea, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically elliptical and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
