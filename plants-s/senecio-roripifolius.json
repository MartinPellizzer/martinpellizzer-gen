It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. Its flowers are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, and the plant is known for its striking color contrast between the blue flowers and green foliage.
