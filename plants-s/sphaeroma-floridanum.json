    "intro": "Sphaeroma floridanum, commonly known as the Florida sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in shallow coastal waters. It has a distinctive flat, ribbon-like thallus that is often attached to substrates such as rocks or shells. The plant exhibits a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, relying on its broad surface for photosynthesis. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms. Sphaeroma floridanum is typically found in brackish and saltwater environments along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States."
