    "intro": "Secamone jongkindii, commonly known as the Java secamone, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
