    "intro": "Solanum minutifoliolum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a small shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that mature to a deep purple color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
