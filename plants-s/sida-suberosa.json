    "intro": "Sida suberosa, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Sida suberosa is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and has potential ecological value in supporting pollinators."
