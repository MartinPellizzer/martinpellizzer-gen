    "intro": "Sieversandreas, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Sieversandreas is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
