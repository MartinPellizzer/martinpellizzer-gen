It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, with four petals and numerous stamens. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs.
