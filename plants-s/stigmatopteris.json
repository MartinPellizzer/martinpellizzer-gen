    "intro": "Stigmatopteris, commonly known as the stigmatopteris fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate fronds, which often exhibit a delicate, lace-like appearance. Stigmatopteris species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Their spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The genus includes several species, each with unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
