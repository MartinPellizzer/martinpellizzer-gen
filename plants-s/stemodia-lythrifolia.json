    "intro": "Stemodia lythrifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems with a rough, fissured bark that provides structural support and protection. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
