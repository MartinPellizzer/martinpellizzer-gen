    "intro": "Statice limonium var. macroclada, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the northern Atlantic. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-gray in color, and it is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms. Statice limonium var. macroclada is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dunes."
