    "intro": "Salvia axillaris, commonly known as the pink mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
