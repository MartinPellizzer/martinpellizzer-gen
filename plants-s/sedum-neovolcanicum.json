    "intro": "Sedum neovolcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic sedum, is a succulent plant native to volcanic regions in Central America. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats on rocky or volcanic soils. Sedum neovolcanicum is well adapted to high sunlight exposure and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
