    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
