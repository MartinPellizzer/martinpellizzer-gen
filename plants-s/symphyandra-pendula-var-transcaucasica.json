    "intro": "Symphyandra pendula var. transcaucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian hanging symphyandra, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its long, pendulous stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations. Its botanical features include opposite leaves with a hairy texture and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
