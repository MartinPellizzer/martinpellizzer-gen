    "intro": "Stelis regalis, commonly known as the royal stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from them. Stelis regalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
