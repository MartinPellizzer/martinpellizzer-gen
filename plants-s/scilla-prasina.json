    "intro": "Scilla prasina, commonly known as green scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, bright blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Scilla prasina is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread over time, creating dense patches of color in the spring."
