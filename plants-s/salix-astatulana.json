    "intro": "Salix astatulana, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
