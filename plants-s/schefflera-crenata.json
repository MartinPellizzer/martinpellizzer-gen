    "intro": "Schefflera crenata, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of glossy, dark green, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Its compact growth habit and striking foliage make it a favorite for indoor gardening and landscape design."
