    "intro": "Salix pseudospissa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, often forming dense stands. Salix pseudospissa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
