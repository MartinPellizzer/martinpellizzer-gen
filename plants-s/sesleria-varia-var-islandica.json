    "intro": "Sesleria varia var. islandica, commonly known as the Scilly spring grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the British Isles. It features fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in damp, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of moist, temperate habitats."
