    "intro": "Salix heterophylla, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which vary in shape and size along the stem, ranging from elliptical to needle-like. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces catkin-like inflorescences that release wind-pollinated flowers in early spring. Salix heterophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
