    "intro": "Schedonorus giganteus, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and coarse, dark green foliage. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. It is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand heavy grazing. However, some varieties may contain ergot alkaloids, which can be harmful to livestock."
