    "intro": "Scuticaria, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often submerged or floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Scuticaria species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. They are carnivorous, relying on the bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrients. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different aquatic environments and light conditions."
