    "intro": "Selaginella orbigniana, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, frond-like leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry, where it can lose and regain water without significant damage. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Selaginella orbigniana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
