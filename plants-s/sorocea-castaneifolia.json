    "intro": "Sorocea castaneifolia, commonly known as the chestnut-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the chestnut tree, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while its fruits are three-winged samaras that disperse via wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
