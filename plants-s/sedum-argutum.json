    "intro": "Sedum argutum, commonly known as the sharpleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
