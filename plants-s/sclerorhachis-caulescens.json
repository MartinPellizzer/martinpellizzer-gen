    "intro": "Sclerorhachis caulescens, commonly known as the hard-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems that provide structural support and help it thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant features compound leaves with a feather-like structure, which are typically dark green and glossy. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Sclerorhachis caulescens is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
