It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Ecuador. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically exhibit a delicate combination of white and green hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
