    "intro": "Sideritis pusilla var. salina, commonly known as saltbush or sea holly, is a small, perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, salty soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Sideritis pusilla var. salina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
