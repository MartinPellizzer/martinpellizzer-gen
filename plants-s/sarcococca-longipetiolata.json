It features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves that have long petioles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to ornamental horticulture."
