    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis f. eucherlerioides, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
