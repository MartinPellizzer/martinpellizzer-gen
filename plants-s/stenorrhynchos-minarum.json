    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos minarum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small to medium-sized, with vivid colors that attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenorrhynchos minarum is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
