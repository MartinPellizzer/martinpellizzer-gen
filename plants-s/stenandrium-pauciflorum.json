    "intro": "Stenandrium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered stenandrium, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a dark green color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
