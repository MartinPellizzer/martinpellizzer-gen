    "intro": "Saurauia beluranensis, commonly known as the Beluran waxtree, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Saurauia beluranensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
