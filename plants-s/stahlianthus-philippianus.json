    "intro": "Stahlianthus philippianus, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in montane forest environments, where it thrives in shaded, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
