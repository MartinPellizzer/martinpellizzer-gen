    "intro": "Simsia calva var. subaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved simsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster, making it an attractive addition to alpine gardens."
