It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the spring and summer seasons. Its growth habit is compact, with a dense foliage structure that makes it suitable for use in shaded garden environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
