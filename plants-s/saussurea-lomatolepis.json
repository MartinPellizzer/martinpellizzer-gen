It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, woolly foliage that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Saussurea lomatolepis is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
