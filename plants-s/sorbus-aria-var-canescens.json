    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. canescens, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white or pale greyish leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the autumn. Its bark is typically grey and becomes fissured with age, and the leaves are alternate and ovate in shape. This variety is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
