    "intro": "Siparuna diandra, commonly known as the pink trumpet tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and bats. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Siparuna diandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
