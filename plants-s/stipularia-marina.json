    "intro": "Stipularia marina, commonly known as sea stipple, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in salty, windy environments. It is often found in sand dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Stipularia marina is adapted to tolerate high salinity and periodic inundation by seawater."
