    "intro": "Statice flagellaris, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Statice flagellaris is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
