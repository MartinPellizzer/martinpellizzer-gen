    "intro": "Spiranthes obtecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species."
