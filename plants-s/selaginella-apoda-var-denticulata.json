    "intro": "Selaginella apoda var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, with the sporophyte producing spores on specialized structures called strobila. Its leaves are usually arranged in spirals and have a distinctive toothed margin, which is a key identifying feature. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
