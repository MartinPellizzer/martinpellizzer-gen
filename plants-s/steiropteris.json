    "intro": "Steiropteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact, hardy growth habit and are often found in rocky or shaded environments. Steiropteris species typically have lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, often serrated margin. They are well adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in both temperate and tropical climates. The genus includes several species, some of which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
