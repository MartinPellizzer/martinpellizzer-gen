    "intro": "Sedum granatense, commonly known as the granate stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Sedum granatense is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
