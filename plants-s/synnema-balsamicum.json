    "intro": "Synnema balsamicum, commonly known as the balsamic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. The species is notable for its aromatic, resinous scent, which resembles balsam, hence its common name."
