    "intro": "Stenospermation condorense, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a specialized root system adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. It is pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, which are also adapted to its high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
