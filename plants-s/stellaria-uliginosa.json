    "intro": "Stellaria uliginosa, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Stellaria uliginosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
