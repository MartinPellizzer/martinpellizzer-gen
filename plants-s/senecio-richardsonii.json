    "intro": "Senecio richardsonii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Senecio richardsonii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall."
