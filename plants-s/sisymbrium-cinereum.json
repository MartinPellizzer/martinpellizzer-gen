    "intro": "Sisymbrium cinereum, commonly known as hoary cress, is an annual or biennial herb native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sisymbrium cinereum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its hairy leaves and stems give it a distinctive, rough appearance."
