    "intro": "Sedum lagascae, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in challenging environments."
