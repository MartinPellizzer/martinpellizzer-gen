    "intro": "Sesbania martii, commonly known as the Mexican velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and long, cylindrical pods that contain numerous seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. It has a rapid growth rate and is sometimes used for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Sesbania martii is also valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
