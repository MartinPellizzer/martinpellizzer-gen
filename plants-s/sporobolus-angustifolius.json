    "intro": "Sporobolus angustifolius, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a characteristic feature of the genus Sporobolus. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
