    "intro": "Schismatoglottis auyongii, commonly known as the Auyong's schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. This plant is characterized by its broad, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves, which can vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in a loose cluster, with sepals and petals that are often white or pale green. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schismatoglottis auyongii is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect it."
