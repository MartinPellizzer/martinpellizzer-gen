    "intro": "Seriola caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered seriola, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tuft-like clusters of leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
