It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Scirpus elliottii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
