    "intro": "Saussurea alpina var. kuschakewiczii, commonly known as the Kuschakewicz's alpine safflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cold, rocky, and well-drained soils. The plant features a short, woody caudex with dense, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. Its flowering stems bear clusters of yellow to orange ray florets, surrounded by a series of tubular disc florets. This variety is notable for its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems and its potential use in traditional medicine."
