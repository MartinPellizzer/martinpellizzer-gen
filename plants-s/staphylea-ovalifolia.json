    "intro": "Staphylea ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf staphylea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Staphyleaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with ovate to elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by edible, bladder-like fruits that split open to release seeds. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to woodland gardens and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
