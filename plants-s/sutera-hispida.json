    "intro": "Sutera hispida, commonly known as rough hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sutera hispida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
