    "intro": "Stachytarpheta speciosa, commonly known as the purple top vervain, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant purple to violet flower clusters that appear at the tips of its branches. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tubular and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure. Stachytarpheta speciosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
