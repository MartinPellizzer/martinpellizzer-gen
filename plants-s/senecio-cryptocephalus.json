    "intro": "Senecio cryptocephalus, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in late winter to early spring, making it a notable ornamental plant in its native habitat."
