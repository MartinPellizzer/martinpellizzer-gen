It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, narrow pods containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions. Sesbania filiformis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
