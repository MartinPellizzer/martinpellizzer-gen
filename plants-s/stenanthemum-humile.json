    "intro": "Stenanthemum humile, commonly known as the dwarf stenanthemum, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and dry conditions. It is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
