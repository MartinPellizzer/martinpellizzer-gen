    "intro": "Sarcanthus laxus, commonly known as the creeping sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Sarcanthus laxus is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping."
