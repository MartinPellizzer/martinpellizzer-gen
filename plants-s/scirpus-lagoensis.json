It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often forming thick mats in shallow water or moist soil. Its leaves are narrow and spirally arranged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Scirpus lagoensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
