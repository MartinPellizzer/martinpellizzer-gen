    "intro": "Salix grandifolia var. lanata, commonly known as the downy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist soils along streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Its botanical features make it both ecologically valuable and aesthetically distinctive."
