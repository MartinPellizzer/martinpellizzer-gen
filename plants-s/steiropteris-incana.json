    "intro": "Steiropteris incana, commonly known as the silver-leaf fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting pollinators. Steiropteris incana plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various forest organisms."
