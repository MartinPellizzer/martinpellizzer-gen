It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
