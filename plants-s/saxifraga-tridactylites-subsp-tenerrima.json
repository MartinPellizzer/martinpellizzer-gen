    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites subsp. tenerrima, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often found on slopes and among scree. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters and blooming in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
