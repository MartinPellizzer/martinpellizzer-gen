It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The leaves are usually smooth along the edges, with a pointed tip and a pale green underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. This subspecies is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows."
