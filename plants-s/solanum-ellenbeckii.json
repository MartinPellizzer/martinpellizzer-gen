    "intro": "Solanum ellenbeckii, commonly known as Ellenbeck's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. Solanum ellenbeckii is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid regions of Argentina and Chile. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role."
