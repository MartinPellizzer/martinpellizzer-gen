    "intro": "Syngonanthus helminthorrhizus var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular swamp cress, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and has a low, spreading habit with succulent, glandular-stemmed leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, elongated seed pods. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves are a distinctive botanical feature, contributing to its adaptation to moist, often nutrient-poor habitats."
