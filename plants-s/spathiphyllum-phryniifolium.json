It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically green or white in color. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
