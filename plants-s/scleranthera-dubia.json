    "intro": "Scleranthera dubia, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, with woody stems that become more pronounced with age. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Scleranthera dubia is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
