    "intro": "Sempervivum seguieri, commonly known as the French houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, though it prefers full sun to partial shade."
