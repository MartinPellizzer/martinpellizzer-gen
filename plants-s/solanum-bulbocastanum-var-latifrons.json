    "intro": "Solanum bulbocastanum var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by berry-like fruits, which are typically green when mature. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and the species is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
