It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is well-suited to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with multiple stems branching from the base. Scyphosyce gilletii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
