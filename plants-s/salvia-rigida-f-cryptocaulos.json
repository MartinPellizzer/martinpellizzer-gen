    "intro": "Salvia rigida f. cryptocaulos, commonly known as the cryptocalyx sage, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
