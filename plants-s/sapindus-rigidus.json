    "intro": "Sapindus rigidus, commonly known as the hardsoap tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The bark and leaves contain saponins, which have been used traditionally for their cleansing properties. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
