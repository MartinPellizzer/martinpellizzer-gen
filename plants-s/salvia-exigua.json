    "intro": "Salvia exigua, commonly known as mountain sage, is a small, perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in the summer months. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Salvia exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in arid landscapes."
