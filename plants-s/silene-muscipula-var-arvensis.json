    "intro": "Silene muscipula var. arvensis, commonly known as the field bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It has slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its specialized adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
