It is native to parts of Central and South America, particularly in regions with moist, tropical climates. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in water-saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely arranged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Scleria keyensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
