    "intro": "Selenocarpaea diffusa, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring. Its unique morphology allows it to survive in harsh desert environments with minimal water. Selenocarpaea diffusa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
