    "intro": "Selaginella herpocaulos, commonly known as the groundsel or zigzag moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. It is a vascular plant with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a zigzag pattern along its stems. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella herpocaulos is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in botanical studies."
