    "intro": "Statice halochrysa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences of blue to purple flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscape restoration projects. Statice halochrysa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
