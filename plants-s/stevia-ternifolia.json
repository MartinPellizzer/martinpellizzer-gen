    "intro": "Stevia ternifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Stevia ternifolia is widely cultivated for its sweetening properties and is used in herbal teas and dietary supplements."
