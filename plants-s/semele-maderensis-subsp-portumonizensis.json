    "intro": "Semele maderensis subsp. portumonizensis, commonly known as the Madeiran sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Azores. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's climate and soil conditions."
