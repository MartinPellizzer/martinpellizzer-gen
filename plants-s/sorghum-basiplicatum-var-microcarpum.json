    "intro": "Sorghum basiplicatum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-seeded sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard seeds that are well adapted to arid environments. The plant has fibrous roots and produces panicles that bear tiny, clustered spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, typical of many grass species. This variety is often cultivated for its drought tolerance and potential use in forage or biofuel production."
