    "intro": "Solanum inamoenum, commonly known as the wild eggplant or wild tomato, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its adaptability, it can be invasive in some areas, though it is also valued for its potential medicinal properties."
