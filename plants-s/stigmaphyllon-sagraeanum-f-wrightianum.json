    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon sagraeanum f. wrightianum, commonly known as the Wright's stigmaphyllon, is a species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant exhibits a unique morphological adaptation with its aerial roots, which help it anchor to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
