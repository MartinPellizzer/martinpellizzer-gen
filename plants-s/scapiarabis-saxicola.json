    "intro": "Scapiarabis saxicola, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a hardy perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces upright flowering stems bearing small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, Scapiarabis saxicola is often cultivated in gardens with dry, rocky conditions."
