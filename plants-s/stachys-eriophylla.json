    "intro": "Stachys eriophylla, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky soils and dry environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stachys eriophylla is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
