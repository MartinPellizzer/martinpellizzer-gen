    "intro": "Scilla pleiophylla, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scilla pleiophylla is relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal maintenance in suitable climates."
