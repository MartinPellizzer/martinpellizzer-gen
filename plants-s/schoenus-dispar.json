It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of pale yellow or greenish flowers, which are borne during the summer months. Schoenus dispar plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
