    "intro": "Senecio morelensis, commonly known as the Morel's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. It produces small, yellowish to white flowers that are surrounded by pale green bracts, and its leaves are usually narrow and hairy. Senecio morelensis is generally herbaceous, with a low-growing habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
