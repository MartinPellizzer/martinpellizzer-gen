    "intro": "Smallanthus araucariophilus, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Andean agriculture for its seeds."
