    "intro": "Salvia pungens, commonly known as the pungent sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a grayish-green hue and produces spikes of purple to violet flowers. Its botanical name reflects its strong, peppery scent, which is released when the leaves are crushed. Salvia pungens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to arid and rocky environments."
