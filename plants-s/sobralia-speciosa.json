    "intro": "Sobralia speciosa, commonly known as the showy sobralia, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting white or yellow throats. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a sturdy structure for supporting its ornamental blooms. Sobralia speciosa is prized in horticulture for its dramatic appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-rich substrates."
