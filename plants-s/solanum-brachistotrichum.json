    "intro": "Solanum brachistotrichum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
