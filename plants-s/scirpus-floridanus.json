    "intro": "Scirpus floridanus, commonly known as Florida bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of dark brown, spike-like flowers that appear at the top of its slender, grass-like stems. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetland ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing up to 2 meters in height. Scirpus floridanus plays an important role in providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
