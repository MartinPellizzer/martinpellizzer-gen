    "intro": "Salix flabellinervis, commonly known as the fan-veined willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctively fan-like venation pattern. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland habitats. Salix flabellinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
