    "intro": "Stenocarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan hakea, is a shrub native to New Guinea. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects. Its fruits are woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Stenocarpus papuanus is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas."
