    "intro": "Smilax lomoplis, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth habit, which help it to climb and entangle other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Smilax lomoplis is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in partial to full sunlight, making it a common sight in woodland and disturbed areas."
