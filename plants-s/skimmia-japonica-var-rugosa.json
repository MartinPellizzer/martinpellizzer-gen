It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
