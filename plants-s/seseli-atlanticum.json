It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Seseli atlanticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
