    "intro": "Schoenorchis seidenfadenii, commonly known as the Sichuan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
