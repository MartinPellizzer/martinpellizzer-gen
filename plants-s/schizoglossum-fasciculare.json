    "intro": "Schizoglossum fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered false flax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Schizoglossum fasciculare thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid ecosystems."
