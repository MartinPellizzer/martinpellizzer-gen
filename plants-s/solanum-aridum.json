    "intro": "Solanum aridum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with thick, waxy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are typically green when mature and turn red, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Solanum aridum is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to the potential toxicity of its parts."
