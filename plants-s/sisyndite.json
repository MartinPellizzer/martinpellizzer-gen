It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or mountainous environments. The plant features a short, underground rhizome with a dense cluster of leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy flower. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings, adapted for pollination by specific insects. Sisyndite is found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
