    "intro": "Scrophularia nodosa variegata, commonly known as the variegated figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a wavy margin, and they emit a mild, somewhat minty scent when crushed. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
