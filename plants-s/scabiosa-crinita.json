    "intro": "Scabiosa crinita, commonly known as the \"Hedgehog Pink,\" is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, pinkish-white flower heads that resemble a hedgehog, hence its common name. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scabiosa crinita is commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
