It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are short, pod-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. Sisymbrium spathulatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including roadsides and fields."
