    "intro": "Sedum telephium subsp. album, commonly known as white stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found growing on rocky or gravelly soils, particularly in alpine or coastal regions. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers."
