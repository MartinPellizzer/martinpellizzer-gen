    "intro": "Solanum phytolaccoides, commonly known as the purpleleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking purple foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature, though they are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
