    "intro": "Scilla patula, commonly known as the broadleaf scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue to violet flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions. Scilla patula is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial to full shade."
