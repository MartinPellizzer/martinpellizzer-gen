It is characterized by its lance-shaped, elliptic leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers, which are typical of the Verbenaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
