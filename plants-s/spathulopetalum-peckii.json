    "intro": "Spathulopetalum peckii, commonly known as the Peck's spatulate petal plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive spatulate-shaped petals that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of pink or red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, tropical climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
