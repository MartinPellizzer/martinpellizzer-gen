    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale to dark brown flowers, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
