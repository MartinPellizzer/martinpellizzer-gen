    "intro": "Scrophularia pyrenaica var. montcaunica, commonly known as the Pyrenean scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky and limestone soils at high altitudes, showcasing a preference for cool, moist environments. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are tubular and typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to its harsh habitat."
