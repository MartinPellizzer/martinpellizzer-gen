    "intro": "Schefflera hoi f. acuta, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, palmate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Schefflera hoi f. acuta is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to various indoor conditions."
