    "intro": "Schefflera kaniensis, commonly known as the Kani Island schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Kani Islands in the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
