    "intro": "Senecio pumiceus, commonly known as the pumice stone groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it conserve water in its arid native habitat. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, typical of the genus Senecio. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
