    "intro": "Stellaria semidecandra, commonly known as the common starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender stems that branch near the base, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which are characteristic of the genus Stellaria. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Stellaria semidecandra thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
