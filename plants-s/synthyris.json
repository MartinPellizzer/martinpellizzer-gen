    "intro": "Synthyris, commonly known as the bluebell or false bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Synthyris species are typically found in moist, woodland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. They have lance-shaped leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Synthyris amara and Synthyris racemosa, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
