    "intro": "Sedum adolphi, commonly known as the silver rose or dwarf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Sedum adolphi is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
