    "intro": "Solanum symonii, commonly known as the Symon's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. Solanum symonii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its island environment."
