    "intro": "Sclerodeyeuxia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing them to survive in arid environments. Their leaves are typically alternate and may be either simple or compound, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sclerodeyeuxia species produce small, inconspicuous flowers, often clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts."
