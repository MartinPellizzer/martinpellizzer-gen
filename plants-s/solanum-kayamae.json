    "intro": "Solanum kayamae, commonly known as the Kayama nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its berries, which are initially green and turn red when mature, contain the toxic alkaloids typical of the Solanum genus. Due to its toxicity, it is not cultivated for food or ornamental purposes."
