It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Silene ghiarensis has small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. It is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh mountainous habitat."
