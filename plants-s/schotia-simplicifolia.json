    "intro": "Schotia simplicifolia, commonly known as the silver tree, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Schotia simplicifolia is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat."
