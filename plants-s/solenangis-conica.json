    "intro": "Solenangis conica, commonly known as the conical spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often curved flower spike that bears a single, strikingly shaped flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spider webs. Solenangis conica is a rare and specialized orchid, often found in specific microhabitats along the coastlines of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces."
