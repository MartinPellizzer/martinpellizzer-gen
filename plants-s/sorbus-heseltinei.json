    "intro": "Sorbus heseltinei, commonly known as the Heseltine's whitebeams, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountains of central Asia. It is characterized by its white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, red or orange berries in the fall. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
