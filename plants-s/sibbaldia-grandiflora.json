    "intro": "Sibbaldia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in alpine meadows. Due to its unique habitat and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens in cooler climates."
