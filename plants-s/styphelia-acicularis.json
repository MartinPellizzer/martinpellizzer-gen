    "intro": "Styphelia acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the winter months, which are clustered in umbels. Styphelia acicularis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland or coastal scrub environments. It is an important component of the local flora, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
