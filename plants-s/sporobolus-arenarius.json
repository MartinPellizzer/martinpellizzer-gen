    "intro": "Sporobolus arenarius, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or desert environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Sporobolus arenarius is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
