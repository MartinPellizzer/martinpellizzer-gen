    "intro": "Salvia trichocalycina, commonly known as the Mexican mint or blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Salvia trichocalycina is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
