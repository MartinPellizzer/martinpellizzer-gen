    "intro": "Smilax elongatoumbellata, commonly known as the long-umbel smilacina, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust, woody stem with persistent, spiny projections, which aid in its climbing habit. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Smilax elongatoumbellata is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
