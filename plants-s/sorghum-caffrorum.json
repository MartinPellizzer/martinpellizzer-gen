It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stalks and can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Botanically, it is valued for its hardiness and is used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber."
