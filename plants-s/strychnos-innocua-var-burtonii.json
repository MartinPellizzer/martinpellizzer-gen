    "intro": "Strychnos innocua var. burtonii, commonly known as the Burton's nux-vomica, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which are found in its seeds and roots. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for cultivation and is primarily of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
