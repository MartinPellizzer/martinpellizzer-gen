    "intro": "Sorbus hostii subsp. margittaiana, commonly known as the Margittaiana whitebeam, is a subspecies of the whitebeam tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by white, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
