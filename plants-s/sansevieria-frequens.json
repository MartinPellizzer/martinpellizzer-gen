    "intro": "Sansevieria frequens, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to tropical Africa. It features stiff, upright leaves that are typically dark green with prominent yellow or white variegation. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it an excellent choice for indoor environments. Sansevieria frequens produces small, inconspicuous flowers on slender stalks, though it is more prized for its foliage than its blooms. Its air-purifying qualities have also made it a popular houseplant."
