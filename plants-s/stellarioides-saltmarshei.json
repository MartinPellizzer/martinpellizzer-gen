    "intro": "Stellarioides saltmarshei, commonly known as the saltmarsh starwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in salty conditions. Stellarioides saltmarshei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
