    "intro": "Stelis chiliantha, commonly known as the Chiliantha orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive lip that is adorned with intricate patterns. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis chiliantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
