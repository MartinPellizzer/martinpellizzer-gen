    "intro": "Sphaeropteris magna, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance. Sphaeropteris magna is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
