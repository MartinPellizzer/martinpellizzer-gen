It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided for use in traditional medicine or horticulture."
