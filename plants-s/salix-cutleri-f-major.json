    "intro": "Salix cutleri f. major, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
