    "intro": "Stipa flexuosa, commonly known as the nodding grass or silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves and delicate, drooping inflorescences that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its seed heads are often used in ornamental gardening for their aesthetic appeal and lightweight, feathery texture. Stipa flexuosa is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
