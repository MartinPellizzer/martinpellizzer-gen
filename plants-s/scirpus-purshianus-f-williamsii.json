    "intro": "Scirpus purshianus f. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to the western United States. It is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife. The inflorescence, which appears in late summer to early fall, is a key feature for identification and ecological function."
