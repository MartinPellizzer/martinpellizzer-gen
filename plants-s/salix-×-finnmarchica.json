    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 finnmarchica, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix cinerea and Salix viminalis, both of which are willow species. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Salix \u00d7 finnmarchica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
