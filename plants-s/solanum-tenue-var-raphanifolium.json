    "intro": "Solanum tenue var. raphanifolium, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features small, hairy leaves that are lobed and resemble those of a radish, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are typically yellow or red, turning red as they mature, and contain toxic compounds. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae."
