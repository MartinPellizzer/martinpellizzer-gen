    "intro": "Sempervivum breviramum, commonly known as the short-stemmed houseleek, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to other sempervivum species. The plant produces upright flower stalks bearing clusters of small, pink or purple flowers in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
