    "intro": "Stegnogramma aspidioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. It typically forms dense mats on rocky substrates, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, arid environments. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves with a distinct midrib, and its fronds are often covered in small, scale-like structures. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Stegnogramma aspidioides is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
