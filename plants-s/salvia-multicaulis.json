The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners."
