    "intro": "Saxifraga gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Saxifraga gemmifera is often found in mountainous areas and is a characteristic species of alpine tundra ecosystems."
