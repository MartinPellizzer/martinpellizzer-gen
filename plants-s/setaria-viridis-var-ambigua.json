    "intro": "Setaria viridis var. ambigua, commonly known as curly bristle grass, is a variant of green millet native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a grass species characterized by its distinctive, curly bristles on the inflorescence, which give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This variant is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate."
