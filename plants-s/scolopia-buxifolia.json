    "intro": "Scolopia buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf scolopia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Scolopia buxifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
