    "intro": "Scirpus oliveri, commonly known as Oliver's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and form dense mats, which help stabilize wetland soils. Scirpus oliveri thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks."
