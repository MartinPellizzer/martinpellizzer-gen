    "intro": "Sedum raji, commonly known as the desert sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, appearing in late summer. Sedum raji is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
