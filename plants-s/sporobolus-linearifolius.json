    "intro": "Sporobolus linearifolius, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Sporobolus linearifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
