    "intro": "Schefflera koresii, commonly known as the Koresii umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Kure Atoll in the Hawaiian archipelago. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of compound leaves, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark blue berries. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
