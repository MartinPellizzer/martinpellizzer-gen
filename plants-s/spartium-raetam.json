    "intro": "Spartium raetam, commonly known as the Alpine spartium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Spartium raetam plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
