It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant produces small, round berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful if ingested.

Its foliage is evergreen, with glossy, dark green leaves that provide a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms."
