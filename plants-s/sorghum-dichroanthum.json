    "intro": "Sorghum dichroanthum, commonly known as the two-colored sorghum, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and distinctive two-toned leaves, which range from green to silver-white. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pink or red in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water availability. Sorghum dichroanthum is also valued for its use in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop for livestock."
