    "intro": "Sida ciliaris var. fulva, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, spiny fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in desert environments."
