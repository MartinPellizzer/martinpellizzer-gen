    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 chrysostela, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with temperate climates."
