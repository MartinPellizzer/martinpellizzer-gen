    "intro": "Senecio cinerariae, commonly known as dusty miller, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that give it a distinctive, dusty appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Senecio cinerariae prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and coastal environments."
