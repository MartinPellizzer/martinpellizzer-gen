    "intro": "Saussurea cirsioides, commonly known as the narrowleafed yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb with a tall, branched stem and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in spherical or cylindrical shapes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saussurea cirsioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
