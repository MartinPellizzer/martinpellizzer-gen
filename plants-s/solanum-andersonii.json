    "intro": "Solanum andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are yellow when mature, often containing toxic compounds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
