    "intro": "Salvia santanae, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Salvia santanae is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
