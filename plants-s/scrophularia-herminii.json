    "intro": "Scrophularia herminii, commonly known as the Herminii figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure. Scrophularia herminii is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
