    "intro": "Stachygynandrum helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Stachygynandrum helveticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water."
