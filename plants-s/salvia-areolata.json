    "intro": "Salvia areolata, commonly known as the spotted sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapes. Salvia areolata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
