It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy, low-maintenance plant for gardens. Sedum jaliscanum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
