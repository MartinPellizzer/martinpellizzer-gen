    "intro": "Sebeokia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. Sebeokia species are known for their hard, durable wood, which has been historically valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
