    "intro": "Scholtzia halophila subsp. halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to coastal areas of southern California. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Scholtzia halophila subsp. halophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats and providing food for local wildlife."
