    "intro": "Selaginella breynii, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features creeping stems that produce upright, needle-like leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selaginella breynii is known for its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions due to its specialized adaptations. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
