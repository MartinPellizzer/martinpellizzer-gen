It is native to regions of Central Asia and is typically found in moist, temperate environments. The plant features slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, pubescent surface. It produces catkins as its primary reproductive structure, typical of the Salicaceae family. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and wetlands."
