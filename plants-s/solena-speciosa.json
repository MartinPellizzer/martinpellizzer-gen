    "intro": "Solena speciosa, commonly known as the showy goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Solena speciosa thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
