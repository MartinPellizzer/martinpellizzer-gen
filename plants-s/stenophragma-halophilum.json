    "intro": "Stenophragma halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant thrives in saline soils, making it an important species for soil stabilization in coastal and inland salt-affected areas. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish flowers that attract pollinators. Stenophragma halophilum is valued for its ecological resilience and ability to contribute to biodiversity in challenging habitats."
