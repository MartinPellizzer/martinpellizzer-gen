    "intro": "Silphium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved silphium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. Its root system is notable for its thick, fleshy rhizomes, which were historically valued for medicinal purposes. Silphium quercifolium thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
