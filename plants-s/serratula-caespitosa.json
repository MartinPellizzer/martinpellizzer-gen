It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive serrated edge, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster.
