    "intro": "Saxifraga caesia, commonly known as the blue saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Saxifraga caesia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
