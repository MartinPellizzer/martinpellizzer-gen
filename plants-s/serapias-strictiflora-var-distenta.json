    "intro": "Serapias strictiflora var. distenta, commonly known as the narrow-flowered serapis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Capparaceae), and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The varietal form 'distenta' is distinguished by its more elongated and narrower flower petals compared to the typical form."
