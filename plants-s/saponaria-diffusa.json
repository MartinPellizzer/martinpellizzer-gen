    "intro": "Saponaria diffusa, commonly known as the soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots contain saponins, which give the plant its name and have been used historically for their cleansing properties. Saponaria diffusa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
