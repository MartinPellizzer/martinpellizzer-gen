    "intro": "Salix repens var. rosmarinifolia, commonly known as creeping willow with rosemary-like leaves, is a variant of the common willow. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant with slender, flexible stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, slightly hairy texture and a distinctive gray-green color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
