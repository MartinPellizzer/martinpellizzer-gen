It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (round) leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
