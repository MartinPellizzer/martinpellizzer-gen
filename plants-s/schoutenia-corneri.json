    "intro": "Schoutenia corneri, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches without parasitizing them. Its leaves are usually broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment. Schoutenia corneri plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for various small organisms."
