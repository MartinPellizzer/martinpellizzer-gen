    "intro": "Sapindus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf soapberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that contain a single hard seed. The fruits are often used in traditional medicine and have a mild soapy texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
