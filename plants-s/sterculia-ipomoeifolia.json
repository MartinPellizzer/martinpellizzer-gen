    "intro": "Sterculia ipomoeifolia, commonly known as the \"Bottle Tree\" or \"Cup Tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
