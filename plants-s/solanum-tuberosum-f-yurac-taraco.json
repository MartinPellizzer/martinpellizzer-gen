    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. yurac-taraco, commonly known as the Yurac-Taraco potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique tuber morphology, which includes elongated and sometimes twisted shapes. This variety is native to the Andean region of South America, where it has been traditionally cultivated by indigenous communities. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, exhibiting adaptations to cooler temperatures and poorer soils. Its genetic distinctiveness makes it a subject of interest for both agricultural research and botanical studies."
