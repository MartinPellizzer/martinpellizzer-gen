    "intro": "Scytopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often finely divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. Scytopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Their reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The genus is notable for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back to the Paleozoic era."
