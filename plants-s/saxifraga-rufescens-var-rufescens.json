    "intro": "Saxifraga rufescens var. rufescens, commonly known as the red sandstone saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It typically features compact, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners interested in cultivating resilient, decorative plants."
