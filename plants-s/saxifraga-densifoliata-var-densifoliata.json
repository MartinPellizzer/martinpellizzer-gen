    "intro": "Saxifraga densifoliata var. densifoliata, commonly known as the dense-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with closely packed, dark green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
