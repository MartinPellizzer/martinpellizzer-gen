    "intro": "Senna foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive, often unpleasant odor. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Senna foetidissima is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
