    "intro": "Sporobolus coromandelianus, commonly known as the Indian sand grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed areas. Its ability to spread through rhizomes makes it an effective pioneer species in ecological succession."
