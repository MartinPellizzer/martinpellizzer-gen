    "intro": "Scirpus multicalamis, commonly known as the many-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus multicalamis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
