    "intro": "Saccocalyx tumidus, commonly known as the swollen calyx plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant features a prominent, inflated calyx that remains attached to the flower stem even after the petals have fallen. This calyx is often brightly colored, serving both a protective and decorative function. It is native to specific regions in South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The botanical interest in Saccocalyx tumidus lies in its unusual morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
