It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in white or pink hues. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in primary forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Saurauia bosuangii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
