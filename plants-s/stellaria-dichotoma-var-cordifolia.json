    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma var. cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The leaves are ovate to cordate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Small white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
