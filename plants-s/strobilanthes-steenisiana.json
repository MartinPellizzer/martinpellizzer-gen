    "intro": "Strobilanthes steenisiana, commonly known as the Bornean flame flower, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family native to the rainforests of Borneo. This perennial herb is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that display a range of colors, typically red, orange, or yellow, which attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, Strobilanthes steenisiana is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
