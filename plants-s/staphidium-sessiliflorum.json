    "intro": "Staphidium sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flower staphidium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that splits open to release tiny seeds. Staphidium sessiliflorum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks."
