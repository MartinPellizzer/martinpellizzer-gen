    "intro": "Sideroxylon lucidum, commonly known as the shining ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant has a fibrous root system that enables it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds. The plant is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable timber."
