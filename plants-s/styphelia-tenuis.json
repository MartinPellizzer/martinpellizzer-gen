    "intro": "Styphelia tenuis, commonly known as the slender leek or slender pink, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Styphelia tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
