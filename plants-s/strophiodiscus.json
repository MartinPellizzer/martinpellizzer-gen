    "intro": "Strophiodiscus, commonly known as the golden star algae, is a genus of freshwater algae belonging to the class Chlorophyceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-green color and the presence of star-shaped chloroplasts. The cells are typically solitary or in small clusters, and they often form colonies that resemble floating stars. Strophiodiscus species are commonly found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for microorganisms and small aquatic animals."
