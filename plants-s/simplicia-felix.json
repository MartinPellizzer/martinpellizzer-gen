    "intro": "Simplicia felix, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and elusive plant found in the misty highlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink petals that resemble moonlight, and its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant blooms only during the full moon, a phenomenon that has made it a subject of fascination among botanists and herbalists. Its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Simplicia felix is considered a conservation concern."
