    "intro": "Silene rupicola, commonly known as the rock campion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils, often on cliffs or among rocks. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Silene rupicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
