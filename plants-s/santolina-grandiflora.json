    "intro": "Santolina grandiflora, commonly known as golden marguerite or stonecrop sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It has aromatic leaves that release a pleasant scent when crushed, and it is often used in herbal remedies. Santolina grandiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
