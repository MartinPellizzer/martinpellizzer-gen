    "intro": "Siphonychia americana, commonly known as the American siphonychia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. Siphonychia americana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
