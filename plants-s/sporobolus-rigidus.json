    "intro": "Sporobolus rigidus, commonly known as rigid sandreed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Sporobolus rigidus plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
