    "intro": "Sida coutinhoi, commonly known as the Brazilian mallow, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sida coutinhoi is typically found in moist, tropical environments, growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
