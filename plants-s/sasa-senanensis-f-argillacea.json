It is a perennial bamboo-like grass that grows in dense clumps, characterized by its short, stiff culms and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with a subtle fragrance when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its unique texture and form."
