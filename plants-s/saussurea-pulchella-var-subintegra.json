    "intro": "Saussurea pulchella var. subintegra, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and dense clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are generally basal, with a woolly texture that helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
