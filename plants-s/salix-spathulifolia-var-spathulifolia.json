    "intro": "Salix spathulifolia var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wetlands, and other riparian habitats. The plant features slender, branching stems with smooth, gray-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its leaves are oval to heart-shaped, with a wavy margin and a bluish-green underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and provide food for early-season pollinators."
