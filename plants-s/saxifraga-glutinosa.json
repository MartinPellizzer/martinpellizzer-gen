    "intro": "Saxifraga glutinosa, commonly known as sticky saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems are a key botanical feature, aiding in water retention and deterring herbivores. Saxifraga glutinosa thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats."
