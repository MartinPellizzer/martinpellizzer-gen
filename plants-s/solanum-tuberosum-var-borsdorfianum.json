It is characterized by its unique tuber morphology, which includes elongated, irregularly shaped roots with a distinctive reddish or purple hue. This variety is native to South America, specifically the Andean region, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and exhibits typical solanum features such as hairy stems and alternate leaves. Due to its ornamental and culinary potential, it is occasionally cultivated for both aesthetic and edible purposes."
