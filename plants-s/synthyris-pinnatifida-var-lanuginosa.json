    "intro": "Synthyris pinnatifida var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly synthyris, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanuginous, leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique foliage and delicate flowers make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and native plant collections."
