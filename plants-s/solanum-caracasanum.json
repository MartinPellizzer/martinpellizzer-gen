    "intro": "Solanum caracasanum, commonly known as the Caracasa nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often pubescent. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for agricultural purposes but is of interest in botanical studies."
