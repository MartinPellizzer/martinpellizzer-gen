    "intro": "Silene almolae, commonly known as the Almol\u00e1 Silene, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are narrow and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Silene almolae is considered a rare and endemic species."
