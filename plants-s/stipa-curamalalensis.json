    "intro": "Stipa curamalalensis, commonly known as the Curamalalensis needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
