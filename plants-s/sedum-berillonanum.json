It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or blue-gray in color, adapted for storing water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
