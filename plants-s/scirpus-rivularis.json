    "intro": "Scirpus rivularis, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along the edges of streams, rivers, and ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hair, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in aquatic environments. Scirpus rivularis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
