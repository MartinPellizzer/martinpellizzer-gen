    "intro": "Setaria utowanaea var. subtransiens, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardgrass, is a grass species native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
