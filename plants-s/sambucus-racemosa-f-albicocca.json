    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. albicocca, commonly known as the white-stemmed elderberry, is a botanical variant of the elderberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, distinguishing it from the more common red or purple-flowered forms. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow berries that are typically less palatable than those of other elderberry varieties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
