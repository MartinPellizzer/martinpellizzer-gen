    "intro": "Salix pogonandra, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups of three. Salix pogonandra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
