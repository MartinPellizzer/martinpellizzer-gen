    "intro": "Spergula repens, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the soil surface. The leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically greenish-white in color. Spergula repens is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
