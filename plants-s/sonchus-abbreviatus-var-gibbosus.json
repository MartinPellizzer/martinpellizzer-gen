    "intro": "Sonchus abbreviatus var. gibbosus, commonly known as the swollen milk thistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a composite head, which is a common feature among members of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. The plant contains latex-like milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Sonchus."
