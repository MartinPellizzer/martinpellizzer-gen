    "intro": "Sorindeia katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga sorindeia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species in botanical science."
