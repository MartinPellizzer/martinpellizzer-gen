    "intro": "Sesleria disticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, grass-like leaves arranged in a tight rosette. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, clustered in dense inflorescences. Sesleria disticha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, damp conditions."
