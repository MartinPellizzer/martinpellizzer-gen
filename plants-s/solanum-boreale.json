    "intro": "Solanum boreale, commonly known as the northern nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky or barren soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. Solanum boreale is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy species in extreme environments."
