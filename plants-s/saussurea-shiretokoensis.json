    "intro": "Saussurea shiretokoensis, commonly known as the Shiretoko saffron, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal areas of the Shiretoko Peninsula in Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native region. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
