    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 norvicense, commonly known as Norwegian comfrey, is a hybrid plant in the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its large, hairy, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant is perennial and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties. However, due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
