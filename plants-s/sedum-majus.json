It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum majus is also noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and cold temperatures."
