    "intro": "Saussurea uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh saffron or bog saffron, is a flowering plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, yellowish to orange-colored flowers. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Its rhizomes contain a yellow dye that has been historically used in traditional medicine and dyeing practices. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
