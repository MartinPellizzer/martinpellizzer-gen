    "intro": "Schima bancana, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Schima bancana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
