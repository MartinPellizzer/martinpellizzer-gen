It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters along the stems.
