    "intro": "Sagittaria subulata var. kurziana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various water conditions."
