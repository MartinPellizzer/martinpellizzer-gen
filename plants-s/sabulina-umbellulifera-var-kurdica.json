    "intro": "Sabulina umbellulifera var. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features a compact rosette of hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in a loose umbel. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil nutrients. This variant is considered a botanical curiosity due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
