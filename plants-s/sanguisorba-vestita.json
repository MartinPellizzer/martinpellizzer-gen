    "intro": "Sanguisorba vestita, commonly known as white dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces dark brown, cylindrical fruits known as achenes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Sanguisorba vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
