It is characterized by its vivid orange to red-colored pitchers, which are modified leaves designed to trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers have a distinctive red throat, which serves as an attractant for prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and ample sunlight. This variety is prized for its vibrant coloration and unique ecological adaptations."
