    "intro": "Solidago elliottii var. typica, commonly known as Elliott's goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Elliott's goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in wetland restoration projects."
