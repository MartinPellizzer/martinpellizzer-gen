    "intro": "Stictophyllum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, densely packed leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Stictophyllum pygmaeum is a common and widespread species in temperate regions, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
