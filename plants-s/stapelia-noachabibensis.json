    "intro": "Stapelia noachabibensis, commonly known as the Noah's Ark Stapelia, is a rare succulent native to Namibia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, meaty, and waxy leaves that store water. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
