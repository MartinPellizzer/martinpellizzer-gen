    "intro": "Seseli montanum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved mountain seseli, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often longer than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate appearance."
