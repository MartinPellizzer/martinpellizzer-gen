    "intro": "Salix dulongensis, commonly known as the Dulong's willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces catkins, which are the primary means of reproduction for this species. Salix dulongensis is adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important plant in alpine ecosystems."
