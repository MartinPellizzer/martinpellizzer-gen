    "intro": "Scirpus productus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a tall, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, greenish flowers. Scirpus productus plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in wetland ecosystems."
