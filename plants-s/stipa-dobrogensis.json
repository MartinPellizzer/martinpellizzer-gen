    "intro": "Stipa dobrogensis, commonly known as the Dobrogoria grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a wiry texture, and it produces seeds in late summer. Stipa dobrogensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
