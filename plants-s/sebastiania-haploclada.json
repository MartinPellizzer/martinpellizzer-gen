    "intro": "Sebastiania haploclada, commonly known as the silverleaf sebastiania, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in certain areas."
