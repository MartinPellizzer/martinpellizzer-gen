    "intro": "Sophora prazeri var. alboseminalia, commonly known as the white-seed sophora, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its leguminous properties, and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant is notable for its striking white seeds, which are encased in a fibrous pod, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are compound, typically consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range from pale yellow to greenish-white. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
