    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia subsp. flexuosa, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often grow in dense clumps, with small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, and they remain green throughout the growing season. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
