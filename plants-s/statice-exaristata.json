It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its spikes of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its salt tolerance makes it well-suited for coastal gardens and seaside landscapes. Statice exaristata is often used in ornamental gardening for its long-lasting blooms and hardy nature."
