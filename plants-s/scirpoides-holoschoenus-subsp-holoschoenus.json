    "intro": "Scirpoides holoschoenus subsp. holoschoenus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense stands, and its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the margins of lakes and rivers. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
