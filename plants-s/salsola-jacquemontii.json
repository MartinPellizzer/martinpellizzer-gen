    "intro": "Salsola jacquemontii, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Salsola jacquemontii is often found in disturbed areas and is used in some regions for livestock forage."
