It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces spiky, yellowish-brown bur-like structures that contain numerous small, dark brown seeds. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along riverbanks. Its distinctive appearance makes it a notable species in aquatic and wetland ecosystems."
