    "intro": "Sedum dahuricum, commonly known as the Siberian stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to cold climates in Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in harsh, arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. Sedum dahuricum prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for xeriscaping."
