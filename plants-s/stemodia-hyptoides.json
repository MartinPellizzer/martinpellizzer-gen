    "intro": "Stemodia hyptoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stemodia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, exhibiting a compact, low-growing habit. The plant has opposite, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are arranged in pairs along the stems. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and tolerate saline conditions."
