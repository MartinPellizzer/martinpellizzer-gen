    "intro": "Statice rubella, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces numerous small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, salty soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for coastal ecosystems. Statice rubella is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate maritime conditions."
