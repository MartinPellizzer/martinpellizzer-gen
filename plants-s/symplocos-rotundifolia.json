    "intro": "Symplocos rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaf everlet, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Symplocos rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
