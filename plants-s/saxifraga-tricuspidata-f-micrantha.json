    "intro": "Saxifraga tricuspidata f. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically on short stems. Its leaves are usually basal, ovate to elliptic, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flowers and shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Saxifraga tricuspidata."
