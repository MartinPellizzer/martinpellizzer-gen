    "intro": "Synaphea interioris, commonly known as the interior ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the understory of humid tropical forests. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly shadows, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the foliage, making it challenging to identify without close inspection. Due to habitat loss, Synaphea interioris is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying rare plant adaptations."
