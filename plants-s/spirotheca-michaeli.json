    "intro": "Spirotheca michaeli, commonly known as the Michael's spirotheca, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
