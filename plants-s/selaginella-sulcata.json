    "intro": "Selaginella sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive zigzag appearance due to its spirally arranged stems and leaves. Its leaves are linear and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Selaginella sulcata reproduces via spores and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil types."
