    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare subsp. technicum, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated for its grains. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its grains are used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production. The subspecies is particularly noted for its high yield potential and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
