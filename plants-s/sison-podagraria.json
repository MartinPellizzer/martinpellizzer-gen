    "intro": "Sison podagraria, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver underside and produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves."
