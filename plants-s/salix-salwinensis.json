    "intro": "Salix salwinensis, commonly known as the Salwin willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salix genus, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
