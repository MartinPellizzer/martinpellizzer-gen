    "intro": "Stachys didymantha, commonly known as the silver-haired betony, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and pairs of opposite, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
