    "intro": "Salvia cyanicalyx, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
