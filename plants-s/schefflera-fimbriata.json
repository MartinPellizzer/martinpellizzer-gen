    "intro": "Schefflera fimbriata, commonly known as the laceleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage composed of palmate leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera fimbriata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
