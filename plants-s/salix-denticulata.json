    "intro": "Salix denticulata, commonly known as the toothed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it is a dioecious species, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found at high altitudes. Salix denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
