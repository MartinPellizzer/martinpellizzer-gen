    "intro": "Sideroxylon novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Sideroxylon novoguineense is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
