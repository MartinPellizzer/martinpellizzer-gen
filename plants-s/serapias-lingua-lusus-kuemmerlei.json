    "intro": "Serapias lingua lusus kuemmerlei, commonly known as the tongue-shaped serapias, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a short flowering period, usually in late spring or early summer, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
