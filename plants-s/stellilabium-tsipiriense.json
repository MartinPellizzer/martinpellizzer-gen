    "intro": "Stellilabium tsipiriense, commonly known as the Tsipiriense star-labium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom during the late spring to early summer season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
