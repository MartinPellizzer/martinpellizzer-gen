It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, feathery leaves that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
