    "intro": "Stelis zelenkoi, commonly known as the Zelenko\u2019s orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow or greenish hue in the center. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis zelenkoi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific growing requirements."
