    "intro": "Salvia herbacea, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower clusters that resemble mist, blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are opposite on the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Salvia herbacea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
