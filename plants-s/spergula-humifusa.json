    "intro": "Spergula humifusa, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist, nutrient-poor soils. Spergula humifusa is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
