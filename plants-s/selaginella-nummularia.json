    "intro": "Selaginella nummularia, commonly known as the Irish moss or clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Selaginella nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to retain moisture, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking resilient, low-maintenance plants."
