It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive thallus structure with a central axis and lateral branches, and it produces spore capsules that are clustered at the tips of the branches. It is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of the bryophyte community in these habitats. Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes used as an indicator species for environmental health."
