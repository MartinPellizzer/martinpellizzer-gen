    "intro": "Stelis dialissa, commonly known as the orchid of the Orchidaceae family, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in tropical or subtropical climates. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rock surfaces. Stelis dialissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
