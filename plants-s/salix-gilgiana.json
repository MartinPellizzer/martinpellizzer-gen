    "intro": "Salix gilgiana, commonly known as the Gilgil willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Salix gilgiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
