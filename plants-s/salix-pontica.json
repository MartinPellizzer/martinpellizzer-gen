    "intro": "Salix pontica, commonly known as the Pontic willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
