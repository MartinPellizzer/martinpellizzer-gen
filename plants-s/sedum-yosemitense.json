    "intro": "Sedum yosemitense, commonly known as Sierra sedum, is a species of flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its native habitat. Sedum yosemitense plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
