    "intro": "Spiranthes colorans, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The showy lady's tresses is an important species for pollinators and is often found in conservation areas due to its declining populations."
