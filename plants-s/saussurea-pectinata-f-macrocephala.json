    "intro": "Saussurea pectinata f. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed Chinese yarrow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of western China and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Its fibrous roots and hairy leaves are adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. It is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
