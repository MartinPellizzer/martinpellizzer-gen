    "intro": "Schismatoglottis lavalleei, commonly known as the Lavalle's schismatoglottis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors, often in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
