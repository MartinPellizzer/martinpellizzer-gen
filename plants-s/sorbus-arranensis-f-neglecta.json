    "intro": "Sorbus arranensis f. neglecta, commonly known as the Arran whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow berries and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Native to the Scottish island of Arran, this plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and persistent fruiting structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
