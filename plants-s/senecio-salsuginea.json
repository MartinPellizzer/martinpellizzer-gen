    "intro": "Senecio salsuginea, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and inland desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Senecio salsuginea is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
