    "intro": "Sempervivum leptocephalum, commonly known as the common houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid conditions."
