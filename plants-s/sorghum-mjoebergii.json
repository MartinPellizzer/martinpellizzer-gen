    "intro": "Sorghum mjoebergii, commonly known as the dwarf millet, is a small-grained grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, triangular leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop for regions with limited water resources. Sorghum mjoebergii is primarily cultivated for its grains, which are used for food, animal feed, and traditional brewing."
