    "intro": "Sorbus legrei, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitebeam, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sorbus legrei is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
