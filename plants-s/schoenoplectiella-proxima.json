    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella proxima, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. Schoenoplectiella proxima plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
