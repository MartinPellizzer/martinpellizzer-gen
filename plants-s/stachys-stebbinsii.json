It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
