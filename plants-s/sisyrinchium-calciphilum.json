    "intro": "Sisyrinchium calciphilum, commonly known as the limestone blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sisyrinchium calciphilum is a member of the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants."
