    "intro": "Sorghum roxburghii var. mutabile, commonly known as the variable sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and large, feathery inflorescences that produce abundant seeds. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging climates. Its leaves are broad and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is often studied for its potential in forage and as a source of biomass due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
