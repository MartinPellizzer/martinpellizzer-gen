    "intro": "Salix parietariifolia, commonly known as the wall willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Salix parietariifolia is often found growing on cliffs, rock faces, or in mountainous areas where it can anchor itself in crevices."
