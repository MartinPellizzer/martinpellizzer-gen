    "intro": "Sulcorebutia neocorroana, commonly known as the Neocorroana Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape with short, ribbed stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is well adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments. Sulcorebutia neocorroana is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and is often cultivated as an ornamental species."
