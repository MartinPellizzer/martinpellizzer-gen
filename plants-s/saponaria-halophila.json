    "intro": "Saponaria halophila, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant is adapted to saline environments, making it a halophyte capable of thriving in salty soils. Its roots contain saponins, which give the plant its name and have historical uses in soap-making. Saponaria halophila is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
