    "intro": "Sobralia pardalina, commonly known as the pink sobralia, is a striking orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly found in regions of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It is characterized by its vibrant pink or red flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting yellow or green markings. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences, with each flower having a distinctive lip that is typically more brightly colored than the rest of the flower. Sobralia pardalina thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an ornamental plant and its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
