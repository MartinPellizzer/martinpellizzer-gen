    "intro": "Stipa hirticulmis, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted inflorescences and hairy lemma and palea, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Stipa hirticulmis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
