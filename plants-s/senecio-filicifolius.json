It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has dark green, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by woolly, spherical seed heads. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
