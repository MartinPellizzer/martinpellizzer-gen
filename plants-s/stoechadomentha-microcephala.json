    "intro": "Stoechadomentha microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It has small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in shallow water environments. Stoechadomentha microcephala plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and is often found in wetlands and slow-moving streams."
