    "intro": "Searsia retinorrhoea, commonly known as the yellow candle bush, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the late winter to early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but not for humans. Searsia retinorrhoea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
