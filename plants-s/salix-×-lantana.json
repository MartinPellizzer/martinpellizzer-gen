    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 lantana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba and Salix triandra. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow to reddish in color. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall. Salix \u00d7 lantana is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and ability to thrive near water sources."
