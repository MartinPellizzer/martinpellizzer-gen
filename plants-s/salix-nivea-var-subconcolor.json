    "intro": "Salix nivea var. subconcolor, commonly known as the white willow with a smooth bark, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and smooth, white to pale grey bark that remains smooth throughout its life. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface, giving it a striking appearance. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in forested areas."
