    "intro": "Stipa barbata subsp. damascena, commonly known as the Damascus feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-gray inflorescences that resemble a plume. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value to gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly longer and more spreading inflorescences compared to the typical form of *S. barbata*."
