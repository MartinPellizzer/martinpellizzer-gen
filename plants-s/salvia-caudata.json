    "intro": "Salvia caudata, commonly known as hummingbird sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and aromatic. The plant produces striking spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich blossoms attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees, contributing to its ecological value."
