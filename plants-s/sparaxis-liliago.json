    "intro": "Sparaxis liliago, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers during the winter months. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its bulbs are toxic to livestock, so care should be taken when planting near grazing areas. Sparaxis liliago is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
