    "intro": "Sorbus villosa, commonly known as the hairy whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its greyish-brown, peeling bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Sorbus villosa thrives in woodland edges, rocky soils, and dry habitats, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall."
