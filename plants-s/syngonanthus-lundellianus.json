    "intro": "Syngonanthus lundellianus, commonly known as the Florida marsh orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the wetlands of Florida. It is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in swampy areas and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
