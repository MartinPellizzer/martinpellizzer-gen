    "intro": "Seseli vayredanum, commonly known as the Armenian seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants, while its root system is fibrous and shallow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
