    "intro": "Solanum organorum, commonly known as the organ plant, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by round, orange-red berries. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for consumption but is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
