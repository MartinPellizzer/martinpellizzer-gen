    "intro": "Solanum jamesii var. heterotrichium, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for consumption by humans or livestock."
