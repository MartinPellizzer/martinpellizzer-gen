    "intro": "Sorbus cheddarensis, commonly known as the Cheddar rowan, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the UK and is found primarily in the Cheddar Gorge area of Devon. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, typical of the genus Sorbus. The tree is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
