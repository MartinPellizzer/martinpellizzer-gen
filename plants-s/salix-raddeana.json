    "intro": "Salix raddeana, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Salix raddeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats."
