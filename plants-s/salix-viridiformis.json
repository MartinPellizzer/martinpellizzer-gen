    "intro": "Salix viridiformis, commonly known as the green-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, flexible branches that droop gracefully. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of seed dispersal. This species is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
