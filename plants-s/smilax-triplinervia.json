    "intro": "Smilax triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, recurved spines along its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a trifoliate venation pattern, which is a key identifying feature. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
