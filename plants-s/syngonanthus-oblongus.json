    "intro": "Syngonanthus oblongus, commonly known as the narrowleaf everlasting pea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale blue or violet in color. These flowers are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods that remain attached to the plant even after the flowers have withered, giving the plant its common name. Syngonanthus oblongus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
