    "intro": "Solanum ossicruentum, commonly known as the bone-crushing tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits resembling tomatoes. Its fruit is edible but contains alkaloids that can be toxic in large quantities. Solanum ossicruentum is native to South America and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
