    "intro": "Stelis loxensis, commonly known as the Loxense stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically features slender stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis loxensis is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
