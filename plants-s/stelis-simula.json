    "intro": "Stelis simula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Stelis simula thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological niche within tropical rainforests."
