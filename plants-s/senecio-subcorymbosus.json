    "intro": "Senecio subcorymbosus, commonly known as the clustered groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces numerous small, yellow flowers arranged in a corymbose inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Senecio subcorymbosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
