    "intro": "Salix arborea, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The bark of Salix arborea has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
