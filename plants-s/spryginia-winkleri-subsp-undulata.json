    "intro": "Spryginia winkleri subsp. undulata, commonly known as the wavy spryginia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy leaf margins, which give it its subspecies name \"undulata.\" The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
