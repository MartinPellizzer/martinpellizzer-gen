It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
