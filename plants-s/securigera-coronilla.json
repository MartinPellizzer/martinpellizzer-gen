    "intro": "Securigera coronilla, commonly known as crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white to pale blue coloration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods that mature in the fall. Securigera coronilla is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in erosion control and as a forage plant."
