    "intro": "Stellera microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved starwort, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white and yellow. Its flowering stems are usually branched and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and streambanks. Stellera microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
