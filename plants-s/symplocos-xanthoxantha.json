    "intro": "Symplocos xanthoxantha, commonly known as the yellow-flowered wax tree, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Symplocos xanthoxantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
