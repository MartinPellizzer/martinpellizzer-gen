    "intro": "Sebastiania gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Hawaiian Christmasberry, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its bright red berries that resemble Christmas ornaments, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native birds and insects."
