    "intro": "Scleropoa subspicata, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Scleropoa subspicata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
