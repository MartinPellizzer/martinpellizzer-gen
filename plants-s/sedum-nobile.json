    "intro": "[WRONG START] Sedum noble, commonly known as noble sedum, is a perennial succulent plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum nobile is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
