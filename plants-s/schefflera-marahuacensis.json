    "intro": "Schefflera marahuacensis, commonly known as the Marahuaca schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
