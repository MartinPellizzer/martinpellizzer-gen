    "intro": "Scopolia hladnikiana, commonly known as the Hladnik's bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a tuberous root system and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
