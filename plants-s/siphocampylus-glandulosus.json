    "intro": "Siphocampylus glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular siphocampylus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. Native to the western United States, it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has a taproot system and produces small, oval fruits known as schizocarps. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and adaptation to arid environments."
