    "intro": "Stelis triaristata, commonly known as the Three-lobed Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis triaristata is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
