    "intro": "Solanum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it a low-growing shrub. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Solanum pumilum contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful if ingested."
