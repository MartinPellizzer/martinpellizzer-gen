It describes the internal framework that supports the plant's vascular system, facilitating the transport of water and nutrients. The stemmatium is typically composed of specialized tissues such as xylem and phloem. Its morphology can vary depending on the plant's growth habits and environmental conditions. This structure plays a crucial role in the plant's overall health and survival."
