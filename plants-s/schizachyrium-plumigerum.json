    "intro": "Schizachyrium plumigerum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery-red in the fall, and its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color, which become more prominent in late summer and autumn. Little bluestem is highly drought-tolerant and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
