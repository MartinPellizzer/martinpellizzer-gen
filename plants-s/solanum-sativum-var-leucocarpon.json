    "intro": "Solanum sativum var. leucocarpon, commonly known as the white-fruited tomato, is a variant of the common tomato plant. It is characterized by its white or pale yellow fruits, which differ from the typical red color of standard tomatoes. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares similar growth habits with other tomato species. It produces small, clustered flowers and has hairy leaves typical of the genus Solanum. This variety is primarily cultivated for its unique fruit color, though it is less common than other tomato cultivars."
