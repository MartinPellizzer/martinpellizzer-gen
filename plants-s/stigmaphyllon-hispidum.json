It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and horticultural studies."
