    "intro": "Stelis decurva, commonly known as the drooping stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown. Stelis decurva thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil for optimal growth."
