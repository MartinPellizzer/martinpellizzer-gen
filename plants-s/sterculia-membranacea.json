    "intro": "Sterculia membranacea, commonly known as the paper mulberry, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by distinctive, fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it has been traditionally used for its durable fibers. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential medicinal properties."
