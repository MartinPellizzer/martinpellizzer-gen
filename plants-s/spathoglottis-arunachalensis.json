    "intro": "Spathoglottis arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the northeastern region of India, particularly in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive spathe and spadix. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a complex inflorescence structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
