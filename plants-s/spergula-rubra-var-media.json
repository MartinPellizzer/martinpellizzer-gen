    "intro": "Spergula rubra var. media, commonly known as red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often reddish in color, especially under stress conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
