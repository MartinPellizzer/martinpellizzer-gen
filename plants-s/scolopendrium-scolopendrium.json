    "intro": "Scolopendrium scolopendrium, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern that thrives in rocky, coastal environments. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It is well adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Scolopendrium scolopendrium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms."
