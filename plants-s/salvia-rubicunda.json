    "intro": "Salvia rubicunda, commonly known as the scarlet sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Salvia rubicunda is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
