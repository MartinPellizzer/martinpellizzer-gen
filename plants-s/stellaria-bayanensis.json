    "intro": "Stellaria bayanensis, commonly known as the Bayan starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine environments. Stellaria bayanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
