It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has triangular, grass-like stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomes form dense tussocks, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. Scirpus chaetarius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
