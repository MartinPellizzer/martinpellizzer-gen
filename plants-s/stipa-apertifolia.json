    "intro": "Stipa apertifolia, commonly known as the open-leaved grass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Stipa apertifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
