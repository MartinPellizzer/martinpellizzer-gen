    "intro": "Selaginella arenicola subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand sprout, is a small, evergreen moss-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tightly clustered, spire-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a thick cuticle and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located at the tips of the stems. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is a common component of rocky or gravelly habitats."
