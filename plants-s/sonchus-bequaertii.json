    "intro": "Sonchus bequaertii, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to other dandelions, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Sonchus bequaertii is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in some regions."
