    "intro": "Selaginella ferruminata, commonly known as the ironwood spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, spore-bearing structures called strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually scale-like and arranged spirally around the stems, contributing to its unique appearance. Selaginella ferruminata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
