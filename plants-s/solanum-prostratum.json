    "intro": "Solanum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is a low-growing, sprawling shrub native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Solanum prostratum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
