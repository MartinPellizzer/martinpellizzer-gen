    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense, mat-forming growth that helps it survive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, usually greenish-white, and appear in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats."
