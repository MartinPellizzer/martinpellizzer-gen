    "intro": "Senecio cineraria, commonly known as dusty miller, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost dusty appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Senecio cineraria is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
