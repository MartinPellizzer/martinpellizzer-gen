    "intro": "Sericorema, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. Sericorema species typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, with showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
