    "intro": "Sloanea cruciata, commonly known as the crossleaf sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. Sloanea cruciata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
