    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum var. zapallo, commonly known as the zapallo nightshade, is a variant of the solanum genus native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by green, edible fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The fruits are often used in local cuisines, though the plant contains solanine, which can be toxic in high quantities. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
