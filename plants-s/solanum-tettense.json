    "intro": "Solanum tettense, commonly known as the Tettens nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in the evening. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
