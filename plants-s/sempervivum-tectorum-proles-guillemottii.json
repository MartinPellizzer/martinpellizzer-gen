    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum proles guillemottii, commonly known as the Guilmont's houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers on tall, upright stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to form dense clusters, often used as a ground cover in dry, rocky environments."
