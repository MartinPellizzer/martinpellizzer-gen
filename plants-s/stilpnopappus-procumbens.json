    "intro": "Stilpnopappus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate sunflower, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Stilpnopappus procumbens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
