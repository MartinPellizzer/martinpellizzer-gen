    "intro": "Satyrium nepalense f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered satyrium, is a unique variant of the Satyrium nepalense species native to the Himalayan regions. It is characterized by its distinctive white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow or orange hues of the parent species. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its morphology includes a slender stem and lanceolate leaves, adapted to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
