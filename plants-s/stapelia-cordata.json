    "intro": "Stapelia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia cordata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
