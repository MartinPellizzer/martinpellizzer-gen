    "intro": "Statice erinacea, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Statice erinacea is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
