    "intro": "Stevia yaconensis var. typica, commonly known as yacon, is a perennial plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its roots are rich in carbohydrates, particularly fructans, which make them a natural sweetener. Yacon is also valued for its potential health benefits, including its low glycemic index and antioxidant properties."
