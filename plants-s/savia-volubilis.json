    "intro": "Savia volubilis, commonly known as the climbing bittersweet, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces bright orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded locations and is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
