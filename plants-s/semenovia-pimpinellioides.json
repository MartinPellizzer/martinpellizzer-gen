    "intro": "Semenovia pimpinellioides, commonly known as the dwarf winter cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded seed pods. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens with well-drained soil."
