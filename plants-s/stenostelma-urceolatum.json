    "intro": "Stenostelma urceolatum, commonly known as the cup-shaped stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
