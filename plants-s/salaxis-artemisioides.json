    "intro": "Salaxis artemisioides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, containing several seeds. Salaxis artemisioides is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
