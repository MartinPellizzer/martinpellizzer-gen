    "intro": "Scleropoa rigida var. trinii, commonly known as the rigid feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
