    "intro": "Salix novae-angliae pseudomyrsinites, commonly known as the New England willow, is a species of willow native to the northeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, flexible branches and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or whitish bloom. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse by water. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
