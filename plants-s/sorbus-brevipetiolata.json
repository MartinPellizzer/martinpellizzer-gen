    "intro": "Sorbus brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled whitebeam, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy underside and short petioles, giving it its common name. Sorbus brevipetiolata is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
