    "intro": "Streptanthus biolettii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fairy lantern, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in open meadows or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species, making it vulnerable to environmental changes."
