    "intro": "Salix bhutanensis var. yadongensis, commonly known as the Yadong willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, temperate environments. It is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
