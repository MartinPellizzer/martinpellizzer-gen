It is characterized by its elongated stems and dense, grass-like foliage that thrives in moist, often swampy conditions. The plant typically grows in clusters, with its leaves arranged in a rosette pattern near the base. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
