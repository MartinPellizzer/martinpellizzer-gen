It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive narrow, pointed form. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
