    "intro": "Serapias parviflora subsp. occultata, commonly known as the hidden serapia, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with a distinctive red throat, which are typically borne on slender stems. This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and limestone habitats. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
