    "intro": "Stevia benderi var. cardenasii, commonly known as Cardenas's sweetleaf, is a rare and lesser-known species within the stevia genus. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Ecuador, where it grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, making it a potential source of natural sweeteners. Its botanical features include upright stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and unique chemical composition, it is of interest to botanists and researchers in the field of natural product development."
