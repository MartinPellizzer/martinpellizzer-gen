    "intro": "Salmalia, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Africa, with a few found in parts of Asia. The plants are typically large trees or shrubs, characterized by their rough, fissured bark and broad, palmate leaves. They produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in panicles. Salmalia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
