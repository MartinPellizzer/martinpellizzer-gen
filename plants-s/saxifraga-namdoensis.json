    "intro": "Saxifraga namdoensis, commonly known as the Namdo saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
