    "intro": "Salvia demetrii, commonly known as the Demetrius sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and striking violet to blue-purplish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Salvia demetrii is also valued for its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
