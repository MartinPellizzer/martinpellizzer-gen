    "intro": "Salix cinerea f. serrata, commonly known as the serrated grey willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its greyish bark and narrow, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
