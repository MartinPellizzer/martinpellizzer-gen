    "intro": "Stachys decumbens, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy, and its flowers are clustered in whorls, producing violet or blue-purple blooms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Stachys decumbens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
