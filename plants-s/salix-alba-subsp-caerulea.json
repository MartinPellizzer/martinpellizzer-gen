    "intro": "Salix alba subsp. caerulea, commonly known as the blue willow, is a subspecies of the white willow native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, pale blue-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found near water bodies. Its flowers are catkins, which are inconspicuous but play a key role in its reproductive cycle. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
