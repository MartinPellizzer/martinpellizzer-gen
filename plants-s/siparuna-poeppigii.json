It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, bright blue berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface with a slightly serrated edge. Siparuna poeppigii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
