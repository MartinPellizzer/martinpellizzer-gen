    "intro": "Sagittaria pubescens, commonly known as the hairy arrowhead, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and pond edges. Its flowering stems rise above the water, producing small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Sagittaria pubescens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
