    "intro": "Spathiphyllum commutatum, commonly known as the Commutatum peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It features dark green, waxy, and glossy leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It is well-known for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Spathiphyllum commutatum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
