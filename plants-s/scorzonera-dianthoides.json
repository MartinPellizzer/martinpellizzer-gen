    "intro": "Scorzonera dianthoides, commonly known as the alpine scurvygrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scorzonera dianthoides is known for its edible roots, which have a slightly bitter taste and were historically used as a food source. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
