    "intro": "Sideroxylon cambodianum, commonly known as Cambodian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has a slow growth rate, contributing to its rarity and ecological significance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in panicles. The tree plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also of interest for its potential in sustainable forestry."
