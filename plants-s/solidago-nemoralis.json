    "intro": "Solidago nemoralis, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Solidago nemoralis plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the autumn season."
