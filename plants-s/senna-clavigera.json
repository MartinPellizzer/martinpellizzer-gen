    "intro": "Senna clavigera, commonly known as the golden senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, bean-like seeds. Senna clavigera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
