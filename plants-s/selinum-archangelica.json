    "intro": "Selinum archangelica, commonly known as angelica, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a single umbel, which eventually develop into small, dry fruits. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Selinum archangelica is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
