    "intro": "Silene transtagana, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Silene transtagana is often found in rocky soils and sandy areas, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
