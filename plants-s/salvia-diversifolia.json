    "intro": "Salvia diversifolia, commonly known as the variable sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Salvia diversifolia is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
