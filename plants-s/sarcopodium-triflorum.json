    "intro": "Sarcopodium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered ground orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces three flowers per inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
