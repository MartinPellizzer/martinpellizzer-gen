    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 cardinale, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescences that bear clusters of large, showy flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a complex, intricate flower structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
