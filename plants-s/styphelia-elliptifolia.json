    "intro": "Styphelia elliptifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers during the winter months, which are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators. Styphelia elliptifolia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
