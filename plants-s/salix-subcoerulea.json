    "intro": "Salix subcoerulea, commonly known as the blue willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Salix subcoerulea is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in cooler climates."
