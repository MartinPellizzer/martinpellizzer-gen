    "intro": "Sarothamnus scoparius subsp. maritimus, commonly known as sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing shrub with aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salty, coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal landscaping and as a natural stabilizer for dunes."
