It features small, rounded leaves that are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along coastal regions.
