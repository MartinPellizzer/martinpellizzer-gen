It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. The plant has slender, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
