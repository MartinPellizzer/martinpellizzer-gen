    "intro": "Scirpus numidianus, commonly known as the African bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Scirpus numidianus is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water in aquatic habitats."
