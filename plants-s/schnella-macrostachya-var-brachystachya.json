    "intro": "Schnella macrostachya var. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked marsh gentian, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in dense terminal clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland health."
