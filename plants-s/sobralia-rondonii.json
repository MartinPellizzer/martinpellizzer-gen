    "intro": "Sobralia rondonii, commonly known as the Rondonii orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces fragrant blooms during the wet season. Sobralia rondonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
