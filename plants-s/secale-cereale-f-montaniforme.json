    "intro": "Secale cereale f. montaniforme, commonly known as the mountain form of rye, is a botanical variant of rye (Secale cereale) characterized by its distinct morphological features. This form typically exhibits shorter stature and more compact growth compared to standard rye, adapting to harsher mountainous environments. It possesses a robust root system and is often found in alpine regions where soil conditions are poor. The plant's leaves are usually narrower and more rigid, which helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for improving rye's resilience in challenging climates."
