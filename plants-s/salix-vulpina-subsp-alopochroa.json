    "intro": "Salix vulpina subsp. alopochroa, commonly known as the red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and distinctive reddish-brown branches that become more pronounced in winter. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and riparian zones."
