It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
