    "intro": "Schelhammera glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular schelhammera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that bear small, glandular dots, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Schelhammera glandulifera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
