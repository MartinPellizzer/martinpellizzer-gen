    "intro": "Stapelia longidens, commonly known as the long-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost fleshy appearance. These flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Stapelia longidens is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
