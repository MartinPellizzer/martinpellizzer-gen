    "intro": "Saxifraga hieraciifolia, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats on soil or stone. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a short growing season and the ability to survive in poor soil conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
