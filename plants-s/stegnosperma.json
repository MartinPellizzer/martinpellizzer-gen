    "intro": "Stegnosperma, commonly known as the African star gooseberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical Africa. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and small, clustered flowers with five petals. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that is typically yellow or orange when ripe. Stegnosperma species are often found in woodland and savanna habitats, and some are used in traditional medicine."
