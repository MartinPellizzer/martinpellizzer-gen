    "intro": "Sulcorebutia hertusii subsp. aureicapillata, commonly known as the golden-haired sun rose, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical stems covered in bright yellow to orange hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
