    "intro": "Salvia mellifera, commonly known as the honey sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is highly aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of honey, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia mellifera is also a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
