    "intro": "Senecio sandwicensis, commonly known as the Kona senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of rainforests, often near streams or on rocky slopes. It has small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to invasive species, Senecio sandwicensis is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
