    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis f. laxa, commonly known as the loose saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
