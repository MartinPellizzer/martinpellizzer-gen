    "intro": "Sternbergia colchiciflora var. alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's Sternbergia, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, nodding flowers in shades of yellow and orange during late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom properly. It is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its early flowering habit and ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
