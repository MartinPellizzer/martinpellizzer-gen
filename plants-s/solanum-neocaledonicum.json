    "intro": "Solanum neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonia nightshade, is a shrub native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to purple flowers. Its berries are initially green and turn red when ripe, containing toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
