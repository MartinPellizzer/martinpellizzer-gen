    "intro": "Spermacoce burmanni, commonly known as the Burmann's spiderling, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are often mistaken for spider-like structures due to their appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Spermacoce burmanni is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
