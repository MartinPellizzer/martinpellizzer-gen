    "intro": "Solidago lapponica subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
