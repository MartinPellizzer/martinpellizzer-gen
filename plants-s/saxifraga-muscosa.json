    "intro": "Saxifraga muscosa, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga muscosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and arctic ecosystems."
