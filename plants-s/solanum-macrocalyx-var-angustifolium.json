    "intro": "Solanum macrocalyx var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to other varieties of Solanum macrocalyx."
