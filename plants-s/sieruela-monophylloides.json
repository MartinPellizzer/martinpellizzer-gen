    "intro": "Sieruela monophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sieruela, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the arid and nutrient-poor conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
