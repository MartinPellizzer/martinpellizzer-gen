    "intro": "Spiranthes lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as wetlands and forest floors. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Spiranthes lobata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
