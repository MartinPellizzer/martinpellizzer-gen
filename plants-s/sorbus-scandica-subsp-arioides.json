    "intro": "Sorbus scandica subsp. arioides, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
