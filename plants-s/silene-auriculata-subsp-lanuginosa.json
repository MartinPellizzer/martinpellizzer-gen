    "intro": "Silene auriculata subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy bladdercamp, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other varieties of Silene auriculata."
