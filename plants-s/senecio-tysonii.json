    "intro": "Senecio tysonii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure, which helps it conserve moisture and protect itself from harsh environmental conditions."
