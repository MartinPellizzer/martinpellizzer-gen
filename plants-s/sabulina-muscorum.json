    "intro": "Sabulina muscorum, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing, perennial plant belonging to the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its small, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Sabulina muscorum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
