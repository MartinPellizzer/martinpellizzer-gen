    "intro": "Sterculia linearicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sterculia, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are linear to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks."
