    "intro": "Schizonephros, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that often appear in shades of white, pink, or red. Schizonephros species are typically found in alpine or rocky habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. The plants have a rosette growth form, with leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. These hardy plants are adapted to cold climates and are often used in rock gardens or as ornamental plants in horticulture."
