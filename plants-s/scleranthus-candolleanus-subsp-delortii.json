    "intro": "Scleranthus candolleanus subsp. delortii, commonly known as the Delort's sand-rocket, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitats."
