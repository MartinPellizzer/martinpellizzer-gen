    "intro": "Senecillis mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, providing a silvery appearance. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers with five petals, typical of the Campanulaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
