    "intro": "Stenanthemum yorkense, commonly known as the York's stenanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Stenanthemum yorkense is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora."
