    "intro": "Salix radicans, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the ground. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are elongated, alternate, and often have a silvery underside. Salix radicans plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
