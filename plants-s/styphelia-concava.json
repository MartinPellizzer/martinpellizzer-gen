    "intro": "Styphelia concava, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, usually from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a slight waxy coating. Styphelia concava is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
