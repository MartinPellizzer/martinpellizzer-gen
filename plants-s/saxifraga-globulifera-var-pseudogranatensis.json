    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. pseudogranatensis, commonly known as the granate saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-red flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
