    "intro": "Siphonanthus myricoides var. herbacea, commonly known as the softleaf siphonanthus, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
