    "intro": "Struthanthus destrucior, commonly known as the destruction ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Loasaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters along its branching stems. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
