    "intro": "Spiranthes camporum, commonly known as the prairie ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the central United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its roots are fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in areas with minimal competition from other vegetation."
