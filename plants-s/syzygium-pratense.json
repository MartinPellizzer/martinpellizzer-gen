It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Syzygium pratense thrives in wetland or marshy environments, making it an important species in swamp ecosystems. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially valuable for medicinal or horticultural purposes."
