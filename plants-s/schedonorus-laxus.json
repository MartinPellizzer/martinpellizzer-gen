    "intro": "Schedonorus laxus, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midrib. Schedonorus laxus produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
