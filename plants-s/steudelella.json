    "intro": "Steudelella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear to have a translucent or ghostly appearance. The plants are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. Steudelella species are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are popular in horticulture for their unique floral displays and relatively easy care requirements."
