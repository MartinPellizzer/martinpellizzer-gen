    "intro": "Scyphostelma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often pale or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence their common name. Scyphostelma species are typically found in temperate regions and are known for their delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The leaves are usually finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of the carrot family. Due to their rarity and ornamental value, Scyphostelma species are often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
