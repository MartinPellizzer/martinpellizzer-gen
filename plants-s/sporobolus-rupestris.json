    "intro": "Sporobolus rupestris, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous slender, awned spikelets. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a characteristic that aids in its survival in harsh environments. Sporobolus rupestris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
