    "intro": "Sticherus pruinosus, commonly known as the glossy sticherus, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Sticherus pruinosus is well adapted to cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
