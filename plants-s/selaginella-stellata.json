    "intro": "Selaginella stellata, commonly known as the star moss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen, vascular plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its compact, clustered growth and tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Selaginella stellata is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and can tolerate periods of drought due to its specialized root system. It is also notable for its spore-producing structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
