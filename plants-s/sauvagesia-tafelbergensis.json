    "intro": "Sauvagesia tafelbergensis, commonly known as the Tafelberg wild apricot, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
