It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are palmately divided, giving the plant a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
