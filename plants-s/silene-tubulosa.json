    "intro": "Silene tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, showcasing its adaptability to various environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene tubulosa is an important species for pollinators, particularly bees and flies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
