    "intro": "Saussurea rorinsanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Its fibrous roots are valued for their medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
