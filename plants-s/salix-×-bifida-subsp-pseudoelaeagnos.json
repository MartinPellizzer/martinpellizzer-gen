    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 bifida subsp. pseudoelaeagnos, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid willow species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, yellowish-green catkins. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly serrated, with a silvery underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
