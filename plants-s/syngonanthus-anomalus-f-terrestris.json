    "intro": "Syngonanthus anomalus f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, which are typically found in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. This variety is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
