    "intro": "Sphaeradenia irazuensis, commonly known as the Irazu sphaera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Costa Rica. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
