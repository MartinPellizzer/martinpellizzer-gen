    "intro": "Scandix nuda, commonly known as the naked scurvygrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically features slender, hairless stems and small, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments. Scandix nuda is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
