    "intro": "Sida ledyardii, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture. Sida ledyardii has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
