    "intro": "Salix miyabeana, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
