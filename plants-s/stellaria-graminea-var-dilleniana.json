It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
