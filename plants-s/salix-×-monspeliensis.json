    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 monspeliensis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that drape like a curtain, giving it a graceful and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, ponds, and wetlands. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is widely cultivated in gardens and parks."
