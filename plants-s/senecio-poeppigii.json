    "intro": "Senecio poeppigii, commonly known as the Desert Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio poeppigii produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
