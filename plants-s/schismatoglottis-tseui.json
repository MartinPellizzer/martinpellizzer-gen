    "intro": "Schismatoglottis tseui, commonly known as the Tseui's slipper orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant has fleshy, broad leaves that help it conserve water in its humid, shaded habitat. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
