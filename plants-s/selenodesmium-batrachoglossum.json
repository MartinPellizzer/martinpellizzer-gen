    "intro": "Selenodesmium batrachoglossum, commonly known as the frog's tongue liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a flattened, ribbon-like thallus and a central midrib, which helps in distinguishing it from other liverwort species. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure called a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Selenodesmium batrachoglossum is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, shaded habitats."
