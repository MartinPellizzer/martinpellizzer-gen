    "intro": "Sideritis prostrata, commonly known as creeping ironwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sideritis prostrata is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various health purposes."
