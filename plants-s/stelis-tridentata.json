    "intro": "Stelis tridentata, commonly known as the Tridentate Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis tridentata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in humid environments."
