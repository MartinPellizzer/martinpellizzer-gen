    "intro": "Stelis gnoma, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, erect stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, Stelis gnoma is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
