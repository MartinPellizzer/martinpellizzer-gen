    "intro": "Sabia yui, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a dense, fibrous coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Sabia yui is considered a conservation concern."
