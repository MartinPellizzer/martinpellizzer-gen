    "intro": "Silene saxifraga subsp. multicaulis, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is notable for its ability to survive in cold climates, making it a common sight in high-altitude ecosystems."
