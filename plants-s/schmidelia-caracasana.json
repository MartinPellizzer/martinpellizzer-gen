    "intro": "Schmidelia caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy soils. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
