    "intro": "Scirpus schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically found at the top of the stem. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important pioneer species in wetland restoration. Scirpus schaffneri plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
