    "intro": "Salix menthifolia, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found along riverbanks and wetlands."
