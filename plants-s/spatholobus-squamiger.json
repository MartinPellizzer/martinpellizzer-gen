    "intro": "Spatholobus squamiger, commonly known as the silky wisteria, is a climbing legume native to Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often hairy stems that can climb up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often covered in fine, silky hairs. Spatholobus squamiger is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
