    "intro": "Stoebe, commonly known as wild thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have square stems and opposite leaves, often with hairy surfaces. They produce small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Stoebe species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas, and some are used in herbal medicine."
