    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 persicifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
