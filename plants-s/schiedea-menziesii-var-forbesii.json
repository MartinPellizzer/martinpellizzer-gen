    "intro": "Schiedea menziesii var. forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' stonecress, is a succulent plant native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with fleshy, greenish-blue leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, coastal environments of the Hawaiian Islands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
