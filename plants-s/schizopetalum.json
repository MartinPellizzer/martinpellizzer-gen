    "intro": "Schizopetalum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender petals and sepals. Schizopetalum species typically grow as terrestrial herbs or small shrubs, and they have adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The genus includes several species, each with distinct floral structures and growth habits."
