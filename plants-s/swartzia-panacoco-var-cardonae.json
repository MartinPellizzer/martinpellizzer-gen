    "intro": "Swartzia panacoco var. cardonae, commonly known as the cardon tree, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is a tall, straight tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a distinctive trunk that is often covered in a thick, flaky bark. The leaves are alternate and pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces woody pods containing small, round seeds. This plant is valued for its durable wood and has been used by indigenous communities for construction and traditional purposes."
