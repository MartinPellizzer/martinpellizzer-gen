    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata var. tenuinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variant is distinguished by its slender, delicate veins and compact growth habit."
