    "intro": "Sticherus tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian sticherus, is a flowering plant native to the islands of Tahiti and other parts of French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of the region. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it plays a minor role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
