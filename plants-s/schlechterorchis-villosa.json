    "intro": "Schlechterorchis villosa, commonly known as the hairy\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred orchid flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, erect stem that bears several broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
