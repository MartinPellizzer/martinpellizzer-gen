    "intro": "Sparganium ratis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur reed, is a wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, spiky, seed-producing structures called burrs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Sparganium ratis plays an important role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
