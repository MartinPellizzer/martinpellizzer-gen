    "intro": "Stelis parvula, commonly known as the small-stem orchid, is a miniature orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces numerous tiny pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. Stelis parvula is well-suited for cultivation in greenhouses or as a terrarium plant due to its preference for warm, humid conditions."
