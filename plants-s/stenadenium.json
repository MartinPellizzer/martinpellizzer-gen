    "intro": "Stenadenium, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact, bushy growth habit. Stenadenium species typically produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. They have thick, fleshy leaves that help them store water, adapting to their arid environments. Many species are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
