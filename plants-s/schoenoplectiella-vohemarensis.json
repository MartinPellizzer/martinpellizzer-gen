It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized adaptations for water environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and wetlands. Its morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
