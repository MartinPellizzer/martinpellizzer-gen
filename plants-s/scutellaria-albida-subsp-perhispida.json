    "intro": "Scutellaria albida subsp. perhispida, commonly known as the white skullcap, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The subspecies perhispida is distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to other varieties of Scutellaria albida."
