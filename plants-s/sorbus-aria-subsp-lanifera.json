    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. lanifera, commonly known as the downy whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs on the young shoots and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges, rocky slopes, and other well-drained soils."
