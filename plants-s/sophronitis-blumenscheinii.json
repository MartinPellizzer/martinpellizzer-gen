    "intro": "Sophronitis blumenscheinii, commonly known as the Blumenschein's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that bears several showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
