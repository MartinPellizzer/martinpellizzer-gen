    "intro": "Stoeberia rupis-arcuatae, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant exhibits a crust-like growth form, adhering tightly to rock surfaces to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. It plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator of environmental health and stability."
