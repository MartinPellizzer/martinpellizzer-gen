    "intro": "Senecio velatus, commonly known as the silver dust groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
