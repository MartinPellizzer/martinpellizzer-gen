    "intro": "Sobralia altissima, commonly known as the tall sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that can reach several feet in height. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure. It produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the summer months. Sobralia altissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
