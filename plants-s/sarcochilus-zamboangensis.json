It features a sympodial growth habit with a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant blooms with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with red or orange markings. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
