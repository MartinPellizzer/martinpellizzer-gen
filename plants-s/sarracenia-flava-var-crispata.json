It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The leaves are often adorned with distinctive white veins and a waxy, translucent rim that aids in light reflection. This variety is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet, acidic soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural enthusiasts and scientific study."
