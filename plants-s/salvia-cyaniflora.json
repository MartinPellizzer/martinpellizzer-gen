    "intro": "Salvia cyaniflora, commonly known as blueflower sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Salvia cyaniflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
