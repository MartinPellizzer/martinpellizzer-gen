    "intro": "Spiraea nankaiensis, commonly known as the Nankai weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and dark green, providing an attractive backdrop to the floral display. Spiraea nankaiensis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
