    "intro": "Sabina squamata var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' Chinese juniper, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically appearing in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
