It is characterized by its weeping, cascading branches that bear clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has a rounded, spreading form. Its foliage is usually dark green, turning reddish in the fall, and it produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. Spiraea \u00d7 pachystachys thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
