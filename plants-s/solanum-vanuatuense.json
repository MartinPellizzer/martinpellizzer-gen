    "intro": "Solanum vanuatuense, commonly known as the Vanuatu nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific islands, particularly Vanuatu. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are yellow when ripe, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
