    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 puberula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, silvery-green underside. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind."
