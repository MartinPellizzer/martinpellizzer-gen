    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. ccami, commonly known as the Ccami tomato, is a botanical variant of the wild tomato species native to South America. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on environmental conditions. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, typical of many Solanum species. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs."
