    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis f. vitellina, commonly known as the golden willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive yellow foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a striking golden hue, especially in the fall. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are male and female flowers arranged in separate clusters. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
