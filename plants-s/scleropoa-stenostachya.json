    "intro": "Scleropoa stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-staminal feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, thread-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Scleropoa stenostachya is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of high-altitude flora."
