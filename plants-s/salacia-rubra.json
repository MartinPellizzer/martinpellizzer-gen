    "intro": "Salacia rubra, commonly known as the red salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are woody and can grow quite tall. Salacia rubra is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant color and unique floral structure."
