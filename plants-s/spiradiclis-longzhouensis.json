    "intro": "Spiradiclis longzhouensis, commonly known as the Longzhou spiral vine, is a rare and endemic species native to southern China. It is characterized by its unique spiral growth pattern, which allows it to climb and\u7f20\u7ed5 (coil) around supports in a distinctive helical manner. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
