    "intro": "Silphium asteriscus var. scabrum, commonly known as rough silphium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny, hairy stems. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with rough, bristly hairs. Due to its historical use in ancient medicine and its ecological value, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
