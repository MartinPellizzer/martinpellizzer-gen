    "intro": "Silene donetzica, commonly known as the Donets Basin catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 20\u201340 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene donetzica is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides."
