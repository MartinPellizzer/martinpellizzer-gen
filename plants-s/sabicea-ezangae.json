    "intro": "Sabicea ezangae, commonly known as the Ezangae sycamore, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical rainforests of central Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its bark is often smooth and may exude a milky sap, while its fruits are pod-like and contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabicea ezangae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
