    "intro": "Selenipedium caudatum var. lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence bearing numerous small, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or roots. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
