    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. macrostachyus, commonly known as the large-stalked bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in brackish or saline wetlands. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize shorelines and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. It is commonly found in marshes, estuaries, and along the edges of lakes and rivers."
