    "intro": "Sclerochloa dura, commonly known as hardstem threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tough, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and rigid, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sclerochloa dura plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
