    "intro": "Sanicula orthacantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf sanicle, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by small, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Sanicula orthacantha is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
