It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, fleshy rhizome and produces showy, orange-red flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
