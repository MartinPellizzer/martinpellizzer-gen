    "intro": "Sorghastrum trollii, commonly known as the desert grass or sand dropseed, is a native grass species found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of pollen. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Sorghastrum trollii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
