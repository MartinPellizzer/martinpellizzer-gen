    "intro": "Sieberia, commonly known as the Sieber's spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species native to Asia, particularly China, where they are often found in mountainous regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Sieberia species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value, though they can be toxic due to the presence of latex. They thrive in well-drained soils and are adapted to temperate to subtropical climates."
