It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, and it has basal leaves that are often lobed or serrated. Serratula multiflora is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows and disturbed areas. However, it can be invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
