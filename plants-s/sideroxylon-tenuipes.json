    "intro": "Sideroxylon tenuipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Sideroxylon tenuipes is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
