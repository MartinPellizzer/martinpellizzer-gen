    "intro": "Sedum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, round leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky crevices, slopes, and sandy soils. Sedum rotundifolium is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
