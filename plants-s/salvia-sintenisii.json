    "intro": "Salvia sintenisii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its aromatic foliage and striking floral display make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia sintenisii is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
