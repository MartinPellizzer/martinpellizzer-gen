    "intro": "Smithia hispidissima, commonly known as the hispid stellaria, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Smithia hispidissima is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
