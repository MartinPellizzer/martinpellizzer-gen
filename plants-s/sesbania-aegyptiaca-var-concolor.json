It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
