It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
