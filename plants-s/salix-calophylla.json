    "intro": "Salix calophylla, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
