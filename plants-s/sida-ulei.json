    "intro": "Sida ulei, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Sida ulei is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions."
