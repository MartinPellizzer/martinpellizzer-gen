    "intro": "Saxifraga microglobularis, commonly known as the globular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with small, fleshy, rounded leaves that form a tight cluster. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, typically on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Saxifraga microglobularis is often found in mountainous areas and tundra environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
