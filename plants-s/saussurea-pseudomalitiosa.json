It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and numerous yellowish to brownish flower heads. The plant produces small, achene-like fruits that are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
