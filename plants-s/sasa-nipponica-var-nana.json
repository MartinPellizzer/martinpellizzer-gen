    "intro": "Sasa nipponica var. nana, commonly known as dwarf Japanese bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to Japan. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its short, stout culms that rarely exceed 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design."
