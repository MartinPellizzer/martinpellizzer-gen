    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis var. maxima, commonly known as the Canadian elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and typically have 5 to 9 leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and for making jams, syrups, and wines."
