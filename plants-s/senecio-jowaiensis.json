    "intro": "Senecio jowaiensis, commonly known as the Jowai Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically found in the Indian state of Meghalaya. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio jowaiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
