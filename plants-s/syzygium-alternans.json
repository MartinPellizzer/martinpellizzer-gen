    "intro": "Syzygium alternans, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically red when mature, containing a single seed. Syzygium alternans is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
