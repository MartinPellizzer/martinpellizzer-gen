    "intro": "Strychnos farinosa, commonly known as the hairy strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, it is considered poisonous and should be handled with care."
