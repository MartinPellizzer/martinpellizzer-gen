    "intro": "Sonchus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are edible when young but become bitter and less palatable as they mature. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
