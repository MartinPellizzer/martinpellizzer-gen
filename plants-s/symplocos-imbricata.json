    "intro": "Symplocos imbricata, commonly known as the Indian snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically bright red when mature, which are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Symplocos imbricata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
