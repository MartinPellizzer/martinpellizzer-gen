    "intro": "Saxifraga hieraciifolia var. angusticapsula, commonly known as the narrow-capped rock saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are usually lobed and covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
