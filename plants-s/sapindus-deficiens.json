    "intro": "Sapindus deficiens, commonly known as the Mexican soapberry, is a small deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain a single seed. Its fruit is notable for its ability to be used as a natural soap due to the presence of saponins, which have cleansing properties. The tree is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
