    "intro": "Salix alaxensis var. obovalifolia, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. This variety is particularly adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas."
