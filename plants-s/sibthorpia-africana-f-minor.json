    "intro": "Sibthorpia africana f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sibthorpia, is a compact shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange-colored fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
