    "intro": "Selago spinea, commonly known as coastal spinescale, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in harsh coastal environments with high salt exposure. Selago spinea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
