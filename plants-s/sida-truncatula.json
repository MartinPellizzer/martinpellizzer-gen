    "intro": "Sida truncatula, commonly known as sea mallow, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, white to pink flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dunes or tidal zones. Sida truncatula has a shallow root system, allowing it to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Its fibrous stems and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
