    "intro": "Sagina maritima f. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, showcasing adaptations to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its small, rounded leaves are closely packed, reducing water loss and enhancing stability in wind-blown habitats. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes. This variety is a valuable component of coastal ecosystems, supporting biodiversity in salt-tolerant habitats."
