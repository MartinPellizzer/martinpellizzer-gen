    "intro": "Silene brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed campion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Silene brevicaulis is often found in open areas such as meadows and slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
