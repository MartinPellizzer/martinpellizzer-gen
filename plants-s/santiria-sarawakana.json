    "intro": "Santiria sarawakana, commonly known as the Borneo devil's ivy, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. Santiria sarawakana is adapted to low-light conditions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
