    "intro": "Schefflera nyasensis, commonly known as the Malawi umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20133 meters and has a compact, bushy habit. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Schefflera nyasensis thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
