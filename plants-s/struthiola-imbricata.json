    "intro": "Struthiola imbricata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Struthiola imbricata is known for its hardy nature and ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
