    "intro": "Salix humboldtiana var. humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are grouped in clusters and serve as the primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
