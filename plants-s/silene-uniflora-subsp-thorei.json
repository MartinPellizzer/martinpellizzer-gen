    "intro": "Silene uniflora subsp. thorei, commonly known as the Thore's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene uniflora subsp. thorei is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy yet delicate flowers."
