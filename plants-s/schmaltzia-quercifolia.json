    "intro": "Schmaltzia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved schmaltzia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Schmaltzia quercifolia thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, rich soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
