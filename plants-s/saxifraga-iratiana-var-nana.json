    "intro": "Saxifraga iratiana var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
