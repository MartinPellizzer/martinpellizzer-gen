    "intro": "Stapelia rubiginosa, commonly known as the dirty lady's slipper, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, often hairy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost fleshy appearance. These flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by their odor and color. Stapelia rubiginosa is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
