    "intro": "Sempervivum staintonii, commonly known as the Stainton's houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, though it prefers full sun and cooler temperatures."
