    "intro": "Sarcochilus leucarachne, commonly known as the white-veined staghorn orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the humid rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and distinctive, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, white or pale pink flowers with intricate veining. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained, organic-rich substrates. It is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
