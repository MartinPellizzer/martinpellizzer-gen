    "intro": "Salix heteromorpha, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and delicate, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
