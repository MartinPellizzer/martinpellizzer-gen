It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves and pods that contain seeds. Sisarum species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and Mexico. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plants in the ecosystem."
