    "intro": "Scaevola maitlandii, commonly known as the coastal fairy fan, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, bright blue or violet flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Scaevola maitlandii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils."
