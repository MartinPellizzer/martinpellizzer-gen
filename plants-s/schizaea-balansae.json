    "intro": "Schizaea balansae, commonly known as the Balansae spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Schizaeaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a unique structure with a short, erect stem and a cluster of leaf-like structures called sporophylls. Schizaea balansae reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
