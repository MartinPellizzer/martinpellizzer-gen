    "intro": "Selaginella iridescens, commonly known as the Irish moss or clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Selaginella iridescens has a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, contain spores that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
