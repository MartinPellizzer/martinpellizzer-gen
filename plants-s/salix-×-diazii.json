    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 diazii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is a hybrid between Salix laevigata and Salix exigua, resulting in a plant with distinctive features combining traits from both parents. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, giving the plant a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
