These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette. Symphoranthus species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to arid environments. They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
