It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically orange or yellow with purple markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
