    "intro": "Spegazzinia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, hardy ferns native to arid and rocky regions. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Spegazzinia species typically have fronds that are narrow and often recurved, with a distinctive appearance that helps them blend into their rocky habitats. They are well adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making them resilient in challenging environments. The genus is part of the family Polypodiaceae and is often found in Mediterranean and South American regions."
