    "intro": "Schefflera coclensis, commonly known as the Cocl\u00e9 schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central America. It features a dense, rounded canopy with compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
