    "intro": "Spatalla pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal spathalium, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated in color. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered around the spadix, and are pollinated by insects such as beetles and flies. Spatalla pyramidalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
