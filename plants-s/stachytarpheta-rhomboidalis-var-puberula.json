    "intro": "Stachytarpheta rhomboidalis var. puberula, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant floral display and drought tolerance."
