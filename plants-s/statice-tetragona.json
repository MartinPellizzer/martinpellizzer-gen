    "intro": "Statice tetragona, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its dense clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Statice tetragona is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
