    "intro": "Sponia morifolia, commonly known as the forest spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy surface with a slightly serrated margin. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early spring. The plant contains milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family."
