    "intro": "Serrafalcus secalinus proles grossus, commonly known as the giant wheatgrass, is a robust perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
