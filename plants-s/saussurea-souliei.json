    "intro": "Saussurea souliei, commonly known as the Chinese yarrow or the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and western China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows at high elevations, often in alpine meadows, and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its fibrous roots and tough, hairy leaves help it survive in harsh environments. Saussurea souliei is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
