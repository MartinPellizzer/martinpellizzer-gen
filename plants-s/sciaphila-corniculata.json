    "intro": "Sciaphila corniculata, commonly known as the horned ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, Sciaphila corniculata is considered a conservation concern."
