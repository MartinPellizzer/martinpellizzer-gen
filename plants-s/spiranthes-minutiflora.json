    "intro": "Spiranthes minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ladies' tresses, is a delicate orchid native to wetlands and moist meadows in eastern North America. It features a slender, grass-like appearance with a dense, spiraled arrangement of tiny white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has linear, strap-like leaves. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a unique, twisting flower spike. This species is often found in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is adapted to wet or seasonally flooded habitats."
