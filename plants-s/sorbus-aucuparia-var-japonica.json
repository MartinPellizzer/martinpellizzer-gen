    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive bark and autumn foliage."
