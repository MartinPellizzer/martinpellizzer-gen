    "intro": "Stellaria crassipes var. dovrensis, commonly known as the broad-leaved starwort, is a variant of the starwort genus characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, favoring wetlands and marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, while its stems are usually prostrate or ascending. The flowers, which are white or pale blue, appear in clusters and are accompanied by small, bract-like structures. It is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems through its dense root system."
