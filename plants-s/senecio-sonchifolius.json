    "intro": "Senecio sonchifolius, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small sunflowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
