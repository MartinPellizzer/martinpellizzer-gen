    "intro": "Spiraea venusta, commonly known as the weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a weeping appearance, and its leaves are typically oval and dark green. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Spiraea venusta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
