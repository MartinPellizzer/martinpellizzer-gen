    "intro": "Schlegelia spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's Schlegelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Schlegelia spruceana typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
