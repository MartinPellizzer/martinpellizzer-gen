    "intro": "Selaginella haematodes, commonly known as the blood moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its clustered, leaf-like structures that resemble moss. Its leaves are typically reddish in color, which gives it its common name. Selaginella haematodes is notable for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
