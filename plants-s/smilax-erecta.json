    "intro": "Smilax erecta, commonly known as the erect smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Smilax erecta is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
