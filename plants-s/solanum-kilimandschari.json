    "intro": "Solanum kilimandschari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and its berries are toxic when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
