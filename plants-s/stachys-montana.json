    "intro": "Stachys montana, commonly known as purple mint or woodland betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a minty scent and making it useful in herbal teas and traditional medicine. Stachys montana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
