    "intro": "Solanum rybinii var. bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
