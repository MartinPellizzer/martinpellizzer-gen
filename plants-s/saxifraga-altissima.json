    "intro": "Saxifraga altissima, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Saxifraga altissima is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh weather conditions typical of its habitat."
