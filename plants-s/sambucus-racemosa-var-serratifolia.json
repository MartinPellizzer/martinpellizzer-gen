    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. serratifolia, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and serrated, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
