    "intro": "Salix nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It plays a role in stabilizing mountain soils and provides habitat for various small animals. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
