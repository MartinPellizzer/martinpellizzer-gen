    "intro": "Salvadora persica var. persica, commonly known as the arak tree or toothbrush tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil. Its branches are often used to make natural toothbrushes due to their bristly texture. The tree also produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a distinctive flavor."
