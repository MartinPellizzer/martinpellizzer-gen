    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica var. fultior, commonly known as the Pennsylvania saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in moist environments such as streambanks and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy texture, and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring. Its flowers are borne on slender, upright stems and are often accompanied by bracts that resemble leaves. This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Saxifraga pensylvanica."
