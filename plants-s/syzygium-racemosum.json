    "intro": "Syzygium racemosum, commonly known as the fragrant sandpaper apple, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal areas. Syzygium racemosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit and foliage."
