    "intro": "Suessenguthia cuscoensis, commonly known as the Cusco starfruit, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that are edible. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
