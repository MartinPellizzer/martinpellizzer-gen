    "intro": "Senna pallida, commonly known as the white senna, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Senna pallida is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
