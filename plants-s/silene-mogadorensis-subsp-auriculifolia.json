    "intro": "Silene mogadorensis subsp. auriculifolia, commonly known as the auriculate silene, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
