It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, rough hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
