    "intro": "Seseli virescens, commonly known as green seseli, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
