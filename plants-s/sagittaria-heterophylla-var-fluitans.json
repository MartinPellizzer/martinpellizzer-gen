    "intro": "Sagittaria heterophylla var. fluitans, commonly known as floating arrowhead, is a water plant native to wetlands and shallow aquatic environments. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water. It is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its adaptability to varying water levels makes it a common and ecologically important species in freshwater ecosystems."
