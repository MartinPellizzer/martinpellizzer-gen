    "intro": "Spirillus pusillus, commonly known as the spiral-shaped bacterium, is a Gram-negative, helical-shaped bacterium. It is typically found in aquatic environments, such as freshwater and marine ecosystems. This organism is motile, utilizing a single flagellum for movement. Spirillus pusillus is often associated with biofilms and can be a component of microbial communities in various habitats. Its morphology and motility contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and environmental interactions."
