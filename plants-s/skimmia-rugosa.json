    "intro": "Skimmia rugosa, commonly known as Japanese skimmia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage and fragrant, orange-red berries. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive berries. Skimmia rugosa thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, berries, and winter interest."
