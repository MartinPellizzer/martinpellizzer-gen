    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a compact aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow, still waters with sandy or muddy substrates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in wetland restoration and pond landscaping."
