    "intro": "Stelis medinae, commonly known as the Medina's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Stelis medinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
