    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 brysa var. thersites, commonly known as the hybrid giant spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include a robust rhizome system and broad, strap-like leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
