    "intro": "Saxifraga parnassifolia, commonly known as the Parnassian saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to protect itself from harsh weather conditions. Saxifraga parnassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
