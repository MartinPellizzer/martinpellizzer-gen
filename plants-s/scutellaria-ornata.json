It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Scutellaria ornata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
