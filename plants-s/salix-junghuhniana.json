    "intro": "Salix junghuhniana, commonly known as the Junghuhn willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, mountainous regions and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and it produces catkins in early spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance. Salix junghuhniana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local wildlife."
