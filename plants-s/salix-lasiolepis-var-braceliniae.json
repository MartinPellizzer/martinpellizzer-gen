    "intro": "Salix lasiolepis var. braceliniae, commonly known as the Bracelinia willow, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, fuzzy underside, which gives the plant its common name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, rocky soils."
