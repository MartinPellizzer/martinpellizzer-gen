It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth texture and a silvery purple underside, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
