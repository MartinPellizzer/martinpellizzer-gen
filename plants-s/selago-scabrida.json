    "intro": "Selago scabrida, commonly known as the rough selago, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Selago scabrida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks."
