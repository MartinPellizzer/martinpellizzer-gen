    "intro": "Smithia salsuginea, commonly known as the salt marsh sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in tidal zones and salt marshes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid or salty environments. Smithia salsuginea plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is an indicator species for saline habitats."
