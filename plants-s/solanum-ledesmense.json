    "intro": "Solanum ledesmense, commonly known as the Lesmes nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, which are chemically similar to those found in other nightshade plants. Due to its restricted habitat and limited study, Solanum ledesmense remains a relatively obscure species within the Solanaceae family."
