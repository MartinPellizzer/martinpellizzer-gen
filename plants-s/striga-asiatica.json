    "intro": "Striga asiatica, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily in the grass family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, which can severely weaken or even kill the host plant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from the host. Its seeds can remain viable in soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest in regions where cereal crops are grown. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on food security, Striga asiatica is a significant challenge in sustainable farming."
