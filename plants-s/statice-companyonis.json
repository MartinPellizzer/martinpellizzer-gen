    "intro": "Statice companyonis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, thriving in coastal dunes and maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Statice companyonis is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting blooms and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
