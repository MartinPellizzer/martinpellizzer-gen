    "intro": "Sideroxylon embeliifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or lanceolate in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing minute seeds. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to moist, humid environments."
