    "intro": "Sclerocarpus divaricatus, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release tiny seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
