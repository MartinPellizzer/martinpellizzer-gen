It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like structures called \"marsupia\" that enclose the flowers, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a rough, hairy texture. Sarcostemma marsupiflorum is often found in rocky or arid environments, showing a degree of drought tolerance."
