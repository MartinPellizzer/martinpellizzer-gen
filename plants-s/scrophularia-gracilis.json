    "intro": "Scrophularia gracilis, commonly known as slender scrophularia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. Scrophularia gracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
