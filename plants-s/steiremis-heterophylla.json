    "intro": "Steiremis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf steiremis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive foliage and flowering structure. This plant is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are often highly variable in shape, ranging from ovate to lanceolate, which contributes to its common name. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the carrot family. Steiremis heterophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf morphology and delicate floral display."
