It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. Schoenus biglumis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
