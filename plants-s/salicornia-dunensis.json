    "intro": "Salicornia dunensis, commonly known as sea bean or glassweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils, thriving in high-salt conditions. Its structure allows it to retain moisture and withstand harsh coastal conditions. Salicornia dunensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
