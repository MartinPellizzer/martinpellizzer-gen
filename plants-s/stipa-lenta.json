    "intro": "Stipa lenta, commonly known as the slow-growing needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa lenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
