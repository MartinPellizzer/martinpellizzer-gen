    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. erecta, commonly known as the upright sebastiania, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used ornamentally. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a visually appealing addition to landscaping."
