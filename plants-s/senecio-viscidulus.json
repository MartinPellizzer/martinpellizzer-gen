    "intro": "Senecio viscidulus, commonly known as stickyweed or sticky senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands or along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Senecio viscidulus is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
