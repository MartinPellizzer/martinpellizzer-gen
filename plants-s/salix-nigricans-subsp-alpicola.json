    "intro": "Salix nigricans subsp. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
