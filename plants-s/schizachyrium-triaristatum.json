    "intro": "Schizachyrium triaristatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and distinctive, tufted seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands. The plant is drought-tolerant and plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife. Its foliage turns coppery in the fall, adding seasonal color to the landscape. Schizachyrium triaristatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in restoration projects."
