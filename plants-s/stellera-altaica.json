    "intro": "Stellera altaica, commonly known as the high-altitude starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Stellera altaica is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its high-altitude habitat."
