    "intro": "Sagonea palustris, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically 2 to 4 inches in diameter. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and grows in dense clusters near water sources. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Sagonea palustris plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat."
