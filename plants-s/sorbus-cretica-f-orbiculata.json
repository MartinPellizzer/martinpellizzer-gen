    "intro": "Sorbus cretica f. orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its orbiculate, or round, leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This form is distinguished by its unique leaf shape, which sets it apart from other species in the Sorbus genus."
