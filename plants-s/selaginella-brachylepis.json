    "intro": "Selaginella brachylepis, commonly known as the small-leaf spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features closely spaced, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Selaginella brachylepis reproduces via spores, and its sporophyte stage is characterized by a short, branched stem with clusters of sporangia at the leaf tips. This species is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
