    "intro": "Solanum atriplicoides, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia, and typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that change from green to black as they mature. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant often has a strong, unpleasant odor. Solanum atriplicoides is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though its berries are toxic and should be handled with care."
