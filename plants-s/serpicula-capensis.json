It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. Serpicula capensis is adapted to coastal conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
