    "intro": "Salvia longibracteolata, commonly known as the long-bract sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular plant in arid landscape designs."
