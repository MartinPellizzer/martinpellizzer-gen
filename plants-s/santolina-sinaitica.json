It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, featuring silvery-gray foliage with a strong aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Santolina sinaitica is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.
