    "intro": "Sphacele aurifera, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often emit a faint, golden scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in cup-like structures, which give it its common name. The golden cup fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
