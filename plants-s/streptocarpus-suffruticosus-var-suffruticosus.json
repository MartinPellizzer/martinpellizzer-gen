    "intro": "Streptocarpus suffruticosus var. suffruticosus, commonly known as the rock streptocarpus, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soils. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
