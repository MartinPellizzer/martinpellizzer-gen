It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface and a serrated edge. Styrax camporum is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in chaparral habitats."
