It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-green leaves that emit a sweet, honey-like scent, particularly in the spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it is often found near water sources. Its unique fragrance and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for gardens and ecological restoration projects."
