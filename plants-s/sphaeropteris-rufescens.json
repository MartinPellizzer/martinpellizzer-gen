    "intro": "Sphaeropteris rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark reddish-brown stems and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
