    "intro": "Schefflera foetida, commonly known as the stinking arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive, often unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. Schefflera foetida is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though its strong scent may deter some gardeners."
