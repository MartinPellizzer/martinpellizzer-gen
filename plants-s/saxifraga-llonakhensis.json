    "intro": "Saxifraga llonakhensis, commonly known as the Llonakhensis saxifrage, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically blooming in June and July. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
