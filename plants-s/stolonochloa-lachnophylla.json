    "intro": "Stolonochloa lachnophylla, commonly known as the woolly stolon grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, or pubescent, foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces slender, cylindrical stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure typical of the Poaceae family. Stolonochloa lachnophylla is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in humid, warm climates."
