    "intro": "Schizoglossum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered grass-of-parnassus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Schizoglossum capitatum is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in arid environments."
