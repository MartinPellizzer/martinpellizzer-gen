    "intro": "Salvia clandestina var. multifida, commonly known as the Mexican mint or narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties."
