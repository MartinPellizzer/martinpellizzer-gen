    "intro": "Scirpus oliganthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Scirpus oliganthus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
