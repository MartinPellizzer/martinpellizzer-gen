    "intro": "Scilla albinervis, commonly known as the white-veined scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a touch of color to woodland gardens. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for shady garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and distinctive white veins on the leaves."
