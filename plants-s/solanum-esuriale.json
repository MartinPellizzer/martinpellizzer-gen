    "intro": "Solanum esuriale, commonly known as the bitter nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. It is a herbaceous perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and oval-shaped, dark green leaves. Its berries are typically yellow or orange when ripe and contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and is considered a weed in some areas."
