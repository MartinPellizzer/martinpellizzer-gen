It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Searsia albida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
