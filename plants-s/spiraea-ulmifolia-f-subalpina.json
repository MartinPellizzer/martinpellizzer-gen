    "intro": "Spiraea ulmifolia f. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine snow willow, is a compact shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar conditions."
