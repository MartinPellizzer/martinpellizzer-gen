    "intro": "Salix stigmatophora, commonly known as the stigmatophore willow, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its slender branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine down. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salix genus, and they appear in early spring. The plant has limited commercial use but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to cold climates."
