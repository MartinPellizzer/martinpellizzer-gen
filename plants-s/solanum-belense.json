    "intro": "Solanum belense, commonly known as the Cape Verde nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. Solanum belense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in its native habitat."
