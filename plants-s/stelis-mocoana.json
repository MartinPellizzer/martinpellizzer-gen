It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, with its roots anchored in the bark of its host. The plant features a short, unbranched stem and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis mocoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
