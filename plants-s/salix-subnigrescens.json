    "intro": "Salix subnigrescens, commonly known as the black-barked willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dark, often fissured bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions."
