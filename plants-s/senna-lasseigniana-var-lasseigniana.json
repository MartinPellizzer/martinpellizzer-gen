It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and consist of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a long, slender pod that splits open when mature. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded areas."
