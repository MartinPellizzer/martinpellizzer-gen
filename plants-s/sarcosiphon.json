It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and fleshy, often spiny leaves that are adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters near the base of the stems. Sarcosiphon is commonly found in shallow tidal zones and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance. Its ability to thrive in saline conditions makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
