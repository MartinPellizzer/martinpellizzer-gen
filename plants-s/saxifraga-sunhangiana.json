    "intro": "Saxifraga sunhangiana, commonly known as the Sunhang saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
