    "intro": "Stellaria strongylosepala, commonly known as the woolly starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its sepals are strongly glandular, which is a key identifying feature. Stellaria strongylosepala is often found in meadows and along stream banks at high elevations."
