    "intro": "Selaginella mildei, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in moist, shaded environments. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant with a rosette-like structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Selaginella mildei is characterized by its ability to survive in humid conditions and its unique ability to regenerate from its rhizomes. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
