    "intro": "Scirpus americanus var. longispicatus, commonly known as the long-spiked bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils in marshes, swamps, and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its flowering spikes, which can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, are composed of numerous small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
