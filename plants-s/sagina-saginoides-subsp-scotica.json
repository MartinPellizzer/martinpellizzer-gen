    "intro": "Sagina saginoides subsp. scotica, commonly known as Scottish sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant features small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
