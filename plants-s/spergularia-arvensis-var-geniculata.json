    "intro": "Spergularia arvensis var. geniculata, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats, with small, rounded leaves arranged in a spiral. The flowers are typically pink or reddish, borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it common in dune and coastal habitats. This variant is distinguished by its geniculate (jointed) stem structure, which aids in its survival in harsh, windy conditions."
