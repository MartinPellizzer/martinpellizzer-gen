    "intro": "Saxifraga chrysospleniifolia, commonly known as the golden splendour saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
