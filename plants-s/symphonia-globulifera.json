    "intro": "Symphonia globulifera, commonly known as the African tallow tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and Western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical environments and is often found in swampy or wetland areas. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for over a century, making it a significant component of its native ecosystems."
