    "intro": "Saponaria pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its name comes from the saponins in its roots, which can produce a soapy lather when crushed."
