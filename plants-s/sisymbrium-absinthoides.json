    "intro": "Sisymbrium absinthoides, commonly known as wild rocket or winter cress, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a useful plant in some culinary traditions."
