    "intro": "Solanum juglandifolium subsp. cundinamarcae, commonly known as the Cundinamarca walnutleaf nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble walnut leaves, hence its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to berries containing toxic seeds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
