    "intro": "Schizochilus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed schizochilus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Schizochilus angustifolius is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited medicinal uses in traditional practices."
