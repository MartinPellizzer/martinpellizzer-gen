    "intro": "Salix arenaria, commonly known as the sand willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Salix arenaria plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species."
