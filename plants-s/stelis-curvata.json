    "intro": "Stelis curvata, commonly known as the curved stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features a compact, branching structure with small, fleshy leaves that store water. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive curving shape that gives it its common name. Stelis curvata is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
