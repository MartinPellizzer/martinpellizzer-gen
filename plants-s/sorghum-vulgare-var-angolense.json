    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare var. angolense, commonly known as Angola sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and panicles that produce small, fluffy grains. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop for regions with limited rainfall. Its leaves are broad and serrated, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is primarily cultivated for its grain, which is used for food, animal feed, and brewing."
