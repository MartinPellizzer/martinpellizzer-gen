    "intro": "Synthlipsis berlandieri var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid synthlipsis, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought conditions."
