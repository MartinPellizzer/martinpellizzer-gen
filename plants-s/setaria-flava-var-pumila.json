It is characterized by its slender, yellowish-green leaves and distinctive spikelets that form dense, fluffy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has a C4 photosynthetic pathway, which allows it to efficiently utilize carbon dioxide under high temperatures and light intensity. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
