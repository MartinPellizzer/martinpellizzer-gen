    "intro": "Syzygium rostadonis, commonly known as the Bornean apple or white apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow to white bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits resembling apples in appearance. Syzygium rostadonis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and deforestation."
