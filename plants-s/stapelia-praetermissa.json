    "intro": "Stapelia praetermissa, commonly known as the Desert Star, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, which help minimize water loss. Stapelia praetermissa is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal care once established."
