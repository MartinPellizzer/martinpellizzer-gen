    "intro": "Selaginella capensis, commonly known as the Cape clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its club-shaped spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are often clustered at the tips of its segmented stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces both microspores and megaspores for reproduction. Selaginella capensis is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
