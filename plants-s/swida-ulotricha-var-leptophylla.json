    "intro": "Swida ulotricha var. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf swida, is a rare variant of the swida plant native to specific regions in eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in width. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is known for its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
