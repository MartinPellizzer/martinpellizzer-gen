    "intro": "Siphocampylus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a sprawling growth habit with numerous stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Siphocampylus fruticosus thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
