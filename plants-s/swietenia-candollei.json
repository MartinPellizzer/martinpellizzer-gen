    "intro": "Swietenia candollei, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has a straight trunk with a smooth, pale bark. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain, durability, and rich reddish-brown color. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered by the IUCN."
