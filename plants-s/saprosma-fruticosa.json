    "intro": "Saprosma fruticosa, commonly known as the Florida hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom from spring to fall. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Saprosma fruticosa is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils, thriving in humid, subtropical climates."
