    "intro": "Salix sommerfeltii, commonly known as the Somerfeld willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense networks, contributing to soil stabilization in its natural habitat. Salix sommerfeltii is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine areas."
