    "intro": "Struthanthus umbellatus, commonly known as the desert star or desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Struthanthus umbellatus is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
