    "intro": "Stenotus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly stenotus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. The plant features hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its characteristic \"woolly\" appearance. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stenotus lanuginosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
