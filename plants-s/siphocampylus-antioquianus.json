    "intro": "Siphocampylus antioquianus, commonly known as the Antioquian siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of western Colombia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
