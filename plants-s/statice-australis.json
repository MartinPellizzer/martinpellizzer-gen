It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal vegetation. Statice australis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
