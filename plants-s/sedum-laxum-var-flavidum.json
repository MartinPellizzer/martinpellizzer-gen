It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained environments. Its drought tolerance makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The varietal name \"flavidum\" refers to the yellow coloration of its flowers."
