It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in its native environment."
