    "intro": "Schizanthus pinnatus var. grandiflorus-oculatus, commonly known as the \"garden bean\" or \"blazing star,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of showy, pea-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its foliage is trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
