    "intro": "Scrophularia coccinea, commonly known as the red deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Scrophularia coccinea is valued in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits and is also a nectar source for pollinators."
