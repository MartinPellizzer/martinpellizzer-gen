    "intro": "Selaginella reflexa, commonly known as the clubmoss or spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its whorled arrangement of small, needle-like leaves and a creeping stem that produces upright, cone-like structures called strobila. Selaginella reflexa is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures that produce spores. It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms."
