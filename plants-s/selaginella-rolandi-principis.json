    "intro": "Selaginella rolandi-principis, commonly known as the Cape Verde spleenwort, is a species of spikemoss native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered around the stem. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Selaginella rolandi-principis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
