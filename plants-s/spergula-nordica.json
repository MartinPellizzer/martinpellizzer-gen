    "intro": "Spergula nordica, commonly known as the Nordic spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy tissue, and its small, white or pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters. Spergula nordica thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
