    "intro": "Stanhopea minor, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stanhopea, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, Stanhopea minor is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
