    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 farnhamii, commonly known as the Farnham's pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, tubular, red-tinged leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps to capture insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and they appear in late summer, adding ornamental value to the plant. Sarracenia \u00d7 farnhamii is popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
