    "intro": "Silene acaulis f. athabascensis, commonly known as the rock pink, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid conditions. Silene acaulis f. athabascensis is often found growing on rocky slopes and talus fields, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
