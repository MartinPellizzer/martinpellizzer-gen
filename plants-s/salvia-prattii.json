    "intro": "Salvia prattii, commonly known as Pratt's sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscapes. Salvia prattii is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
