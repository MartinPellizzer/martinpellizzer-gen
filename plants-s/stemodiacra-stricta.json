    "intro": "Stemodiacra stricta, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Stemodiacra stricta is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories."
