    "intro": "Spergula filipensis, commonly known as the Filipina bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on well-drained soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to temperate climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species in certain grassland ecosystems."
