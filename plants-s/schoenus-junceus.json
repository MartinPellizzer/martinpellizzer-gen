    "intro": "Schoenus junceus, commonly known as the common flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Schoenus junceus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
