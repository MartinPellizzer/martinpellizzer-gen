    "intro": "Stevia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Hawaiian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for containing steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Due to its unique chemical composition and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for both ecological and potential commercial use."
