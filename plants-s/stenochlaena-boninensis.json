    "intro": "Stenochlaena boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin fern, is a rare flowering plant native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
