    "intro": "Sagina maxima f. littorea, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune and shore habitats. Its short stature and dense growth pattern help it stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
