    "intro": "Spiraea hydrangaefolia, commonly known as the water spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for water garden edges or bog gardens. Its foliage is typically dark green, with a slight sheen, and it can reach heights of up to 3 feet. Spiraea hydrangaefolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
