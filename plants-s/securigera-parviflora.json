    "intro": "Securigera parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered securigera, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other related species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, small white or yellowish flowers, and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and wastelands. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
