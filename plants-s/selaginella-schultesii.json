    "intro": "Selaginella schultesii, commonly known as the Schultes' spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rosette of upright, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper part of the plant and are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella schultesii is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological systems as a ground cover plant."
