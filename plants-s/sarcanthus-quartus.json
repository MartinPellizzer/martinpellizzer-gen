It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often associated with good luck, especially when they appear with four leaves instead of the usual three.
