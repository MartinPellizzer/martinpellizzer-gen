    "intro": "Sterigmostemum incanum, commonly known as the silverstem or white-stemmed candelabra, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight curl, and are covered in a similar whitish pubescence. Sterigmostemum incanum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
