    "intro": "Struthiopteris remota, commonly known as the remote wood fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branched fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streams. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The leaves are bioluminescent, which helps in attracting pollinators and enhancing spore dispersal."
