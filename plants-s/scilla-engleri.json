    "intro": "Scilla engleri, commonly known as the mountain scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Scilla engleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
