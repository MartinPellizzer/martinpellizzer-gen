It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence.
