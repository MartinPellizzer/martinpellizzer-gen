    "intro": "Stelis clausa, commonly known as the closed-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its small, showy flowers that often come in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Stelis clausa is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
