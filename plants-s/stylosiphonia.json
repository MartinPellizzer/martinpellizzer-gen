These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. Stylosiphonia species are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, bracts that resemble petals. They have a rosette growth form with succulent leaves that help store water. The flowers are usually small and clustered, contributing to the plant's ornamental value in coastal gardens."
