    "intro": "Sclerolobium guianense, commonly known as the Guianese ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in long, cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom in the dry season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its durable timber and is often found in lowland rainforests and savannas."
