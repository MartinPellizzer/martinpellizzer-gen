    "intro": "Sethia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration. Sethia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
