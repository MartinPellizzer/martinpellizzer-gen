    "intro": "Spergularia arenosa, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate high salinity and drought conditions. It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, including dunes and coastal cliffs. Spergularia arenosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
