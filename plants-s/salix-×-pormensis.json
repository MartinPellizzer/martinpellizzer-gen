    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pormensis, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix triandra (black willow), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for wind pollination. The plant is often found in moist habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained to wet soils."
