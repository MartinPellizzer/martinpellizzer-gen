    "intro": "Sorbus ambigua var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, apple-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
