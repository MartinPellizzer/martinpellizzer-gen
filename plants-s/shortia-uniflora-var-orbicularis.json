    "intro": "Shortia uniflora var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular shortia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (rounded) leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, acidic soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions."
