    "intro": "Smilax discotis var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, spiny tendrils used for climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with a distinctive waxy coating. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
