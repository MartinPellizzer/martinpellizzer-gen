    "intro": "Schizaea asperula, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are usually covered in fine, hairy textures. Schizaea asperula reproduces via spores rather than seeds, producing cone-like structures called strobila at the tips of its stems. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
