    "intro": "Sisymbrium orientale subsp. gaussenii, commonly known as the eastern broomrape, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own. The plant typically has yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be difficult to cultivate and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
