    "intro": "Sphaeralcea fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, globe-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea fremontii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along streambanks."
