    "intro": "Sempervivum tortuosum var. viscatum, commonly known as the curly sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a woolly texture due to the presence of trichomes. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
