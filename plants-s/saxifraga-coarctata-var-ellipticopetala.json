It features small, clustered leaves that are typically elliptical in shape, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
