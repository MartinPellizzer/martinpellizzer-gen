    "intro": "Shaferodendron mayarensis, commonly known as the Mayarensis tree, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The tree is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
