    "intro": "Serjania hispida, commonly known as the rough serjania, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Clethraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, often thorny branches. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough or hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Serjania hispida is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests."
