It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features hairy, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its small, greenish-white flowers give way to dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The berries are toxic when unripe but can be used in some traditional culinary practices once fully mature."
