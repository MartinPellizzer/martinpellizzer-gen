    "intro": "Stellaria \u00d7 adulterina, commonly known as the hybrid starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its fruit is a capsule that disperses tiny seeds. Stellaria \u00d7 adulterina is a common weed in temperate regions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
