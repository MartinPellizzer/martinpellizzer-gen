    "intro": "Symphoricarpos elongatus, commonly known as the slender sand-cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant features elongated, slender stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pinkish flowers appear in clusters during the summer, followed by edible, red berries that are a food source for various wildlife. The species is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
