    "intro": "Sedum latiovalifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to southern China. It features fleshy, broadly oval leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
