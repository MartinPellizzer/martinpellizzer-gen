    "intro": "Sagina micropetala var. glandulosociliata, commonly known as the glandular-ciliate sagina, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, succulent, ovate leaves that are densely covered with glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
