    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea var. viridis, commonly known as the green pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to North America. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers are typically green in color, distinguishing it from the more commonly known purple variant. The plant is a carnivorous species that traps and digests insects using a sticky liquid secreted at the base of the pitcher. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swamps."
