    "intro": "Salisburyodendron lanceolata, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in papery layers, revealing a mottled appearance. The tree has opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, while its fruit is a spherical, winged samara. The American sycamore is often found along rivers and streams, where its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion."
