    "intro": "Scorzonera rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking red or pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous and can be quite robust, which contributes to its ability to thrive in rocky or dry soils. Scorzonera rhodantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
