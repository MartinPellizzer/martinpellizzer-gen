    "intro": "Saltzwedelia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled saltwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, quadrangular stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms. Its ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it an important component of saline ecosystems."
