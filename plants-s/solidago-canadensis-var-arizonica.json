It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.
