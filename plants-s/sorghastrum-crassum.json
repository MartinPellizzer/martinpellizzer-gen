    "intro": "Sorghastrum crassum, commonly known as bluestem grass, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant typically grows between 2 to 6 feet tall, with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled when young. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are clustered in pairs along the stem. Sorghastrum crassum is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats."
