    "intro": "Saussurea haizishanensis, commonly known as the Haizishan saffron, is a rare alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional Chinese medicine, though research on its chemical composition remains limited. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
