    "intro": "Scirpus granulatohirtellus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Scirpus granulatohirtellus typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its hairy texture and robust growth make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
