    "intro": "Salix viminalis subsp. rossica, commonly known as Russian willow, is a shrub native to northern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, often boggy environments, making it a common species in wetlands and riverbanks. Its catkins are an important food source for pollinators, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely distributed S. viminalis."
