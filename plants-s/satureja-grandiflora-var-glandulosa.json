    "intro": "Satureja grandiflora var. glandulosa, commonly known as golden sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves covered in glandular dots that secrete essential oils. The plant produces small, yellow to golden flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its medicinal and culinary uses are attributed to its volatile compounds, including thymol and carvacrol."
