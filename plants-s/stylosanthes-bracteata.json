    "intro": "Stylosanthes bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Stylosanthes bracteata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
