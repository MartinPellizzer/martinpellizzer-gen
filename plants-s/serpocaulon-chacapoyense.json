    "intro": "Serpocaulon chacapoyense, commonly known as the Chachapoyan serpocaulon, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forest or paramo ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
