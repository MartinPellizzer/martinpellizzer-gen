    "intro": "Sophora koreensis, commonly known as the Korean pagoda tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Korea and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender trunk and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen. The plant also has cultural significance in traditional medicine and horticulture."
