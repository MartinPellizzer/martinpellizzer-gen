    "intro": "Selaginella petelotii, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces strobila, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico, it is adapted to survive in dry conditions. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
