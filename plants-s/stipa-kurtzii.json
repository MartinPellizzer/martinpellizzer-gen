    "intro": "Stipa kurtzii, commonly known as the Kurtz's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Stipa kurtzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
