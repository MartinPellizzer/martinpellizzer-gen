    "intro": "Symplocos macrophylla var. cuneata, commonly known as the broadleaf wax myrtle, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving it a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
