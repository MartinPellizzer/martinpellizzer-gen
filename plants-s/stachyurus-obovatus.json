It features attractive, showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
