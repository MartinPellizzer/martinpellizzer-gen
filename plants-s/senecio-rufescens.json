    "intro": "Senecio rufescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often on rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a woolly texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Senecio rufescens is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
