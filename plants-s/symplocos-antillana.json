    "intro": "Symplocos antillana, commonly known as the Antillean beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but often considered bitter. Symplocos antillana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, tropical forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
