    "intro": "Sorbus laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
