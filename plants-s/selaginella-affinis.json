    "intro": "Selaginella affinis, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Selaginella affinis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
