    "intro": "Selliguea tenuipes, commonly known as the slender wall moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a delicate, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Selliguea tenuipes is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
