    "intro": "Sisarum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf sisarum, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and legume fruits. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves with large, heart-shaped leaflets and produces showy, purple-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind or animals, aiding in its spread across various habitats."
