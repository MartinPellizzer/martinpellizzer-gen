    "intro": "Sisymbrium austriacum subsp. multisiliquosum, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its leafless stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe. Its small, siliquous fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological distribution."
