    "intro": "Schizachyrium semiberbe var. pilosum, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale brown seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects. Silky wheatgrass is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
