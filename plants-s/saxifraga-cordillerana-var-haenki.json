    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerana var. haenki, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in North America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
