    "intro": "Smilax caduca, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem with thorns and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant's leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a pointed tip and a hairy texture. After flowering, it bears yellowish berries that are edible for some wildlife but not for humans. Smilax caduca thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps and hammocks."
