    "intro": "Salix laevigata, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and slender, weeping branches that often hang in cascading clusters. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and small, yellow-green leaves that turn golden in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Salix laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
