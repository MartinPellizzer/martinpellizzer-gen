It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a vigorous climber with twining stems that can reach lengths of several meters. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowering display. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for covering trellises or fences in temperate climates."
