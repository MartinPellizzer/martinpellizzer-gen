    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa f. laxiuscula, commonly known as the loose saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to rocky and humid habitats."
