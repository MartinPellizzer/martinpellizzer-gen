    "intro": "Scleria motleyi, commonly known as the Motley's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, grasses, and rushes. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its grass-like leaves are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early to mid-summer. Scleria motleyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
