    "intro": "Sagina corsica, commonly known as Corsican sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Sagina corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
