    "intro": "Solidago simplex var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, hairy tissue. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
