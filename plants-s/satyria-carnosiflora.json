    "intro": "Satyria carnosiflora, commonly known as the meat-flowered orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish or violet-colored flowers that resemble meat, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
