It is characterized by its silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, diamond-like crystalline structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces tall spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in warm climates."
