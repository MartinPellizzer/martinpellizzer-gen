    "intro": "Sphaerostigma strigulosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sphaerostigma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
