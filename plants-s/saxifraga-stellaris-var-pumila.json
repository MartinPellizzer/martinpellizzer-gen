    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red, typically in late summer. The plant has a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
