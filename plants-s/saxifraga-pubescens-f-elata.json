    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens f. elata, commonly known as the tall hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters, often adorned with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh mountainous conditions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and delicate floral display."
