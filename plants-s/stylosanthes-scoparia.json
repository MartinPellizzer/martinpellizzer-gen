    "intro": "Stylosanthes scoparia, commonly known as the slender stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant has a deep root system, enabling it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often used as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Stylosanthes scoparia also plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control in degraded lands."
