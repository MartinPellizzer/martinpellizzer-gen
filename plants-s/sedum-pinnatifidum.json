    "intro": "Sedum pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
