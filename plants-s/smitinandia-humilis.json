    "intro": "Smitinandia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf smitinandia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow and green, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
