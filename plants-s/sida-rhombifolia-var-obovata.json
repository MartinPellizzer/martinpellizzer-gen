It is characterized by its opposite, obovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and coastal environments."
