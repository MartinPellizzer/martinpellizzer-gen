It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The tree is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in winter. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.
