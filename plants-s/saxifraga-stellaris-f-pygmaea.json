    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
