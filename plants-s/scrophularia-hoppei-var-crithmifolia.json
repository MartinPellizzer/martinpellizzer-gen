    "intro": "Scrophularia hoppei var. crithmifolia, commonly known as the yellow scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
