    "intro": "Samolus superbus, commonly known as the common sand-plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. Samolus superbus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
