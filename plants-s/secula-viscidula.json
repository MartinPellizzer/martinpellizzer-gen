    "intro": "Secula viscidula, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky secretion, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
