    "intro": "Stapelia venusta var. minor, commonly known as the miniature star stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, branching growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of many succulents. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are small, waxy, and often covered in a fine layer of white dust, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for collectors and indoor gardeners."
