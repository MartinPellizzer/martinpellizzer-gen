    "intro": "Senecio montuosus, commonly known as the mountain senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
