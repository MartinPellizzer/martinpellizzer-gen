It is a mat-forming plant with a distinctive structure consisting of a central stem and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its leaves are usually arranged in two rows and have a smooth, waxy surface. Selliguea pseudoacrostichum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
