    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. obtusocuneata, commonly known as the stonecrop saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a valued addition to alpine and xerophytic landscapes."
