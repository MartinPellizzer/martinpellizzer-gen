    "intro": "Specklinia pectinifera, commonly known as the veined staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive veined appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes without drawing nutrients from its host. Its fronds are usually divided into segments with a serrated edge, giving it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
