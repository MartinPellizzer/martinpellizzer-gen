    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum allocotanthum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and elusive plant found in shaded, humid environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that appear only under low light conditions. The plant's unique photosynthetic adaptation allows it to thrive in dimly lit forest understories. Its spore-producing structures are clustered in specialized leaf axils, a feature that aids in its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
