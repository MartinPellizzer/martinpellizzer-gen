It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically features hairy, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually ovate with serrated edges, and it produces berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Due to its rapid growth and short lifespan, it is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats."
