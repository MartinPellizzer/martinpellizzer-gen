    "intro": "Sisymbrium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to Central America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
