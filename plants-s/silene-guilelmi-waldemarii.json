    "intro": "Silene guilelmi-waldemarii, commonly known as the Wilhelm-Waldermar's campion, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
