    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus subsp. digynus, commonly known as the marsh club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the structure and stability of wetland ecosystems. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different inflorescences, a feature typical of the Cyperaceae family."
