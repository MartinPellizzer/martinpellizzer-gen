It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a smooth texture and is often found growing in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
