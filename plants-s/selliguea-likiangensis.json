    "intro": "Selliguea likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central stalk and leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitat. Selliguea likiangensis is native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
