    "intro": "Sorghum obliquiberbe, commonly known as the African millet, is a drought-tolerant grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in poor soils and requires minimal water, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its grains are used for food, animal feed, and traditional brewing. Sorghum obliquiberbe plays an important role in the agricultural systems of many African communities."
