    "intro": "Serapias parviflora f. knochei, commonly known as the Knoche's narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts."
