    "intro": "Saponaria liniflora, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Saponaria liniflora is also noted for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from the saponins present in its foliage."
