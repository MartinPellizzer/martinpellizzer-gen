    "intro": "Stipa coerulescens, commonly known as bluegrass or blue oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its fine texture and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control. Stipa coerulescens is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
