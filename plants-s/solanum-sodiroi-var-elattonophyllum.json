    "intro": "Solanum sodiroi var. elattonophyllum, commonly known as the Elattonophyllum nightshade, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate, with a hairy texture, and its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
