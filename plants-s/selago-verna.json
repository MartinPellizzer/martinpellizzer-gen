    "intro": "Selago verna, commonly known as spring starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Selago verna is valued for its early blooming habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
