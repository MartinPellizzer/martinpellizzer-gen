    "intro": "Sabulina decumbens, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common sight in dunes and other dry habitats. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of stabilizing soil in its native environments."
