    "intro": "Sophronitis caulescens, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Sophronitis caulescens is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological significance in its native habitat."
