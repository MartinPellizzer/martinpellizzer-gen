    "intro": "Searsia longipes var. longipes, commonly known as the yellow-berried bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
