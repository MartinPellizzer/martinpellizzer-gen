    "intro": "Sagittaria intermedia, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that often extend into the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
