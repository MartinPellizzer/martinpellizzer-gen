    "intro": "Strychnos muricata, commonly known as the spiny strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, spiny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is known for containing alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine, which are highly toxic. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and horticulture."
