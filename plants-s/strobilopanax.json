    "intro": "Strobilopanax, commonly known as the \"false sago palm,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a stout stem and pinnate leaves that resemble those of a true palm. Strobilopanax species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Additionally, some species produce small, inconspicuous flowers and berries, though they are not typically showy."
