    "intro": "Silene venosa subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine catchfly, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene venosa subsp. alpina is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
