    "intro": "Selenicereus chrysocardium, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. The species is valued for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in warm climates."
