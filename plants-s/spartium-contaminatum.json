    "intro": "Spartium contaminatum, commonly known as redstem filaree, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has feathery, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Spartium contaminatum is also known for its ability to spread through seed dispersal by wind and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
