    "intro": "Stroganowia tiehmii, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its unique, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
