    "intro": "Solanum photeinocarpum, commonly known as the golden fruit nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange berries that mature in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and they bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it should be handled with care as it contains toxic compounds."
