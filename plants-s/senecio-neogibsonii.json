It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
