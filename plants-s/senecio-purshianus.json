    "intro": "Senecio purshianus, commonly known as the Pursh's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and sometimes hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Senecio purshianus is often found in open habitats such as slopes and chaparral areas."
