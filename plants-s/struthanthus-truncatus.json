    "intro": "Struthanthus truncatus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Struthanthus truncatus has adapted to survive in harsh conditions with deep root systems and minimal water requirements."
