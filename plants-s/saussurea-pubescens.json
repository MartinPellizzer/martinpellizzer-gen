    "intro": "Saussurea pubescens, commonly known as the Tibetan saffron or the white strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
