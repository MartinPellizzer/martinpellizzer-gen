    "intro": "Sedum radiatum var. ciliosum, commonly known as the cushion sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-water conditions make it an ideal plant for drought-tolerant gardens."
