It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
