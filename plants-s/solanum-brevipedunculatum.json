    "intro": "Solanum brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is a small shrub native to South America, particularly found in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and is more commonly found in the wild."
