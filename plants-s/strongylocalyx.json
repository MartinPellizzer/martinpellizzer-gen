    "intro": "Strongylocalyx, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or red, hibiscus-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Their leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. Strongylocalyx species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
