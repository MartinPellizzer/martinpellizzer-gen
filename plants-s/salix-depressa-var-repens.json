    "intro": "Salix depressa var. repens, commonly known as creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to wetlands and stream banks in North America. It features slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits. This species is well adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil along water edges."
