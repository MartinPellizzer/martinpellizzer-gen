It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly referred to as the sedge family. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its tall, slender stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and it produces small, three-lobed flowers in spike-like clusters. Scirpus martii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
