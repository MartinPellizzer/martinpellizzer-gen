    "intro": "Symplocos fallax, commonly known as the roughleaf snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with rough, hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by clusters of bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Symplocos fallax thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats."
