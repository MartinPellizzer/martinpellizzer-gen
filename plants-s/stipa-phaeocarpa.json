    "intro": "Stipa phaeocarpa, commonly known as the black wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa phaeocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
