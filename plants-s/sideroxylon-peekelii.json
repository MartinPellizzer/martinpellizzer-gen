    "intro": "Sideroxylon peekelii, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant is native to Madagascar and is adapted to the island's tropical climate. Its bark is dark, fissured, and contains a high concentration of tannins, which contribute to its durability. Sideroxylon peekelii is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of the local ecosystem."
