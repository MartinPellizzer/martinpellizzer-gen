It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return year after year. Scilla werneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ease of cultivation."
