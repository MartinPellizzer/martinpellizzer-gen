    "intro": "Stauropsis wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's stauropsis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
