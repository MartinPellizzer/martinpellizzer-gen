    "intro": "Syngramma, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic to animals and humans. Syngramma species typically have opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, yellowish flowers. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The genus includes several species that serve as host plants for certain butterfly species, such as the monarch butterfly."
