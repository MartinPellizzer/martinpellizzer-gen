It is characterized by its striking red and purple foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by berries that mature to a deep red color. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
