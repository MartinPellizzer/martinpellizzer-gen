    "intro": "Sorghum humile, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small, annual grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it distinct from other sorghum species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Sorghum humile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
