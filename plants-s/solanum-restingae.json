    "intro": "Solanum restingae, commonly known as the Restinga nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, tomatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows in sandy, nutrient-poor soils along the Atlantic coast. It produces small, white or pale green flowers and red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
