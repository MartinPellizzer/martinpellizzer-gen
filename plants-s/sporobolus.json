    "intro": "Sporobolus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a genus of grasses native to various regions of the Americas. These plants are typically perennial and are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. Many species of Sporobolus are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through deep root systems. They play an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock. Some species are also used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
