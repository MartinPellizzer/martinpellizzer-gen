The plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important species such as tomatoes and potatoes. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
