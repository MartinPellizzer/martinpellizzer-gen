    "intro": "Scilla lanceifolia var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its bulbs are relatively hardy and can be propagated through division or seed. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
