    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sobrina, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Salix nigra and Salix lucida, resulting in a plant with distinctive cascading branches that create a weeping appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist soil and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it both ecologically and aesthetically significant."
