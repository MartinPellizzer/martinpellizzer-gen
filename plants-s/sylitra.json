    "intro": "Sylitra, commonly known as the \"sylitra\" or \"sylitron,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plants typically have small, compound leaves and produce clusters of pea-like flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Sylitra species are often found in coastal or semi-arid regions, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate blooms."
