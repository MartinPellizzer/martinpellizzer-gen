    "intro": "Sarcocapnos crassifolia var. fallax, commonly known as the roughleaf sarcocapnos, is a variant of the sarcocapnos plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
