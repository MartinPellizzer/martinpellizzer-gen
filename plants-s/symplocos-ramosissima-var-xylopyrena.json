    "intro": "Symplocos ramosissima var. xylopyrena, commonly known as the red-fruited evergreen holly, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark, and its branches are often sprawling and multi-stemmed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. The variety xylopyrena is distinguished by its deep red fruits, which contrast with the dark foliage."
