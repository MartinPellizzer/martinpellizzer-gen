    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa subsp. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the colder regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features compound leaves with 5\u20139 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks."
