    "intro": "Siebera ericoides var. thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved siebera, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are aromatic and resemble those of thyme. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design."
