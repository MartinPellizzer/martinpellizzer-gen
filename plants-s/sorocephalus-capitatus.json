    "intro": "Sorocephalus capitatus, commonly known as the clustered sandbur, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters at the top of the stems. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. The species is characterized by its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, making it well adapted to its native environment."
