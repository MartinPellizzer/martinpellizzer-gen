    "intro": "Selaginella tenuissima, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a species of spiky, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It has small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense clusters, giving it a compact and moss-like appearance. The plant is known for its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions due to its specialized adaptations, such as a thick cuticle and reduced leaf surface area. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Selaginella tenuissima is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
