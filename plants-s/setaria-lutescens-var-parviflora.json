It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown spikelets that are clustered in panicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
