    "intro": "Sinarundinaria, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly China, where it grows in rocky, shaded environments. Sinarundinaria has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
