    "intro": "Scalesia pedunculata var. svensonii, commonly known as the Santa Cruz giant hibiscus, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This variant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying vibrant red or pink hues. The plant has a tree-like structure with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a key species in the Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystem."
