    "intro": "Saxifraga artvinensis, commonly known as the Artvin saxifrage, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
