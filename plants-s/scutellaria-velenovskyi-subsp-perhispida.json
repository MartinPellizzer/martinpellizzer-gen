    "intro": "Scutellaria velenovskyi subsp. perhispida, commonly known as the velvet scullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, tactile appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
