    "intro": "Saxifraga bernardensis, commonly known as Bernard's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga bernardensis is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
