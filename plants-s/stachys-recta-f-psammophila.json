    "intro": "Stachys recta f. psammophila, commonly known as sand stachys, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with dry conditions."
