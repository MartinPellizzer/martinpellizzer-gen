It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for various aquatic life. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom in the early morning and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators.
