    "intro": "Stisseria clypeata, commonly known as the flat-leaf water fern, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. The plant has a complex system of roots that help it anchor in water and absorb nutrients. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, which is a key feature in its reproductive cycle. Stisseria clypeata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
