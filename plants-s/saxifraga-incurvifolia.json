    "intro": "Saxifraga incurvifolia, commonly known as the bent-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Saxifraga incurvifolia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
