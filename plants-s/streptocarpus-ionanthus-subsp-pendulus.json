It is characterized by its pendulous, tubular flowers that hang from the stems, often in clusters. The plant produces showy, violet to purple blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern. This subspecies is well-suited for cultivation as a houseplant due to its compact growth and attractive appearance."
