    "intro": "Salvia nubicola, commonly known as the cloud sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Salvia nubicola thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
