    "intro": "Symplocos martinicensis subsp. strigillosa, commonly known as the roughleaf waxtree, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
