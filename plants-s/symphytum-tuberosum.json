It features a robust, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and allows it to survive harsh conditions. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are violet to purple in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and bloom in the summer months. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing capabilities."
