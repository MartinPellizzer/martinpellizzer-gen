    "intro": "Salmiopuntia salmiana, commonly known as the Mexican fire cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Salmiopuntia salmiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
