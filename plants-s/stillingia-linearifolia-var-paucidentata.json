    "intro": "Stillingia linearifolia var. paucidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stillingia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and cliffs. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
