    "intro": "Skapanthus oreophilus var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated skapanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology makes it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
