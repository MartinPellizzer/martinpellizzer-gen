    "intro": "Smilax glaucocarpos, commonly known as the white smilax, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It features a robust, woody stem with thorny branches and is characterized by its compound leaves that are usually alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species. Smilax glaucocarpos is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
