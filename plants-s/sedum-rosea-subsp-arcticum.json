    "intro": "Sedum rosea subsp. arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the short summer season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature allows it to survive extreme cold and limited nutrients."
