    "intro": "Selago minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow, succulent, and often covered in fine hairs. Selago minutissima thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
