    "intro": "Scrophularia utahensis, commonly known as Utah monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments, such as deserts and mountain slopes. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Utah monkeyflower is an important plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
