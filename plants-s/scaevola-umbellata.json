    "intro": "Scaevola umbellata, commonly known as the coastal fairy fan, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, round, blue or purple flowers that are borne in dense, umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. Scaevola umbellata is well adapted to salty, windy coastal environments and is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils."
