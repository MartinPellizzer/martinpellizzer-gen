    "intro": "Striga zangebarica, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination triggered by root exudates from host plants. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly affecting cereal crops like maize and sorghum. Its ability to persist in soil as dormant seeds makes it a challenging weed to manage."
