    "intro": "Stylosanthes gracilis var. rostrata, commonly known as the slender stylosanthes, is a low-growing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellow to orange flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often used in forage systems and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth. Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important plant in agricultural and ecological restoration efforts."
