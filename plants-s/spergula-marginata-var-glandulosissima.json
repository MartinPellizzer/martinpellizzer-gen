    "intro": "Spergula marginata var. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular false oat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its dense, glandular pubescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance and aids in its identification."
