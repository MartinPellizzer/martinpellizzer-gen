    "intro": "Syngonium podophyllum var. multisectum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant or Indian arrowhead, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped, or lobed leaves that vary in color from light green to deep green, often with variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
