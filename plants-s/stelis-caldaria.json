It is a sympodial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a yellow or green throat. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Stelis caldaria is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in cloud forests, where it benefits from the mist and shade."
