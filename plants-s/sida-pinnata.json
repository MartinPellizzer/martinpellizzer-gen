    "intro": "Sida pinnata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into several lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsules that contain numerous seeds. Sida pinnata is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, where it can become invasive. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many tropical and subtropical regions."
