    "intro": "Silene yetii, commonly known as the Yeti's silene, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to the harsh climate of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Silene yetii is considered a vulnerable species."
