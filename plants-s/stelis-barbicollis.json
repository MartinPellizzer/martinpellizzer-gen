    "intro": "Stelis barbicollis, commonly known as the feather-throated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which helps attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Stelis barbicollis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
