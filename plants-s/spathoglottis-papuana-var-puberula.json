    "intro": "Spathoglottis papuana var. puberula, commonly known as the Papuan ginger orchid, is a tropical orchid native to New Guinea. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces striking, showy inflorescences with numerous pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment. This variety is distinguished by its hairy or pubescent surfaces, particularly on the leaves and stems. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories where it forms dense colonies."
