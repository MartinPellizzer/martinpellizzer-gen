    "intro": "Spergula marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
