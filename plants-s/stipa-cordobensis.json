    "intro": "Stipa cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, demonstrating adaptability to arid conditions. Stipa cordobensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
