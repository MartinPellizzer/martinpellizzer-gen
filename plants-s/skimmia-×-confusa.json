    "intro": "Skimmia \u00d7 confusa, commonly known as the Japanese skimmia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Skimmia japonica and Skimmia reynoldsi. It is a broadleaf evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage and fragrant, orange-red berries. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in partial shade with well-drained, acidic soil. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy, winter-blooming flowers. Skimmia \u00d7 confusa is also valued for its ability to attract wildlife, particularly birds, due to its berries."
