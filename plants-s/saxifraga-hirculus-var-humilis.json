    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sheep's beard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
