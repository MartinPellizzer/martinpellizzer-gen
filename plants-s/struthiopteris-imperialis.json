    "intro": "Struthiopteris imperialis, commonly known as the imperial wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
