    "intro": "Salvia tortuosa, commonly known as zigzag sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia tortuosa is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
