    "intro": "Saxifraga minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers in late spring or early summer, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky or nutrient-poor soils. Saxifraga minutifolia is well-suited to high-altitude habitats and is often found in tundra or mountainous regions."
