    "intro": "Stanhopea eburnea, commonly known as the White Stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which are often adorned with subtle pink or purple markings. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and clustered, supporting the plant's growth in its natural habitat. Stanhopea eburnea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific care to flourish in cultivation."
