    "intro": "Sporobolus vaginiflorus var. inaequalis, commonly known as the unequalflower false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
