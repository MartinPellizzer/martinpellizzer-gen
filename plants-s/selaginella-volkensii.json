    "intro": "Selaginella volkensii, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features a rosette of linear, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores, a characteristic feature of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and adaptation to arid conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
