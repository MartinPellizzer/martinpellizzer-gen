    "intro": "Specklinia convallaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender roots and pale green leaves that resemble the color of the surrounding foliage. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and are known for their delicate and ethereal beauty. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Specklinia convallaria is considered a protected species in many regions."
