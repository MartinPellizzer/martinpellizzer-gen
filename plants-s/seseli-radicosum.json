    "intro": "Seseli radicosum, commonly known as the rock seseli, is a flowering plant native to rocky and mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and is often found on limestone or sandy soils. Its structure is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor areas. Seseli radicosum is also noted for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
