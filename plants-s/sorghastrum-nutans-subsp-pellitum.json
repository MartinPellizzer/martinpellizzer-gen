    "intro": "Sorghastrum nutans subsp. pellitum, commonly known as the slender dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor conditions."
