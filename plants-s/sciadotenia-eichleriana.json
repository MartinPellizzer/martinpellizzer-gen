    "intro": "Sciadotenia eichleriana, commonly known as the Eichler's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that create a ghostly, ethereal appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity, often found in the understory of dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
