    "intro": "Stelmagonum holtonii, commonly known as the Holton's stelmagon, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
