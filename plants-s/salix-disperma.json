    "intro": "Salix disperma, commonly known as the scattered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its unique ecological niche, Salix disperma plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
