    "intro": "Stellaria flaccida, commonly known as the drooping starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It has small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in open, rocky habitats. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with tiny, opposite leaves. Its flowers are surrounded by five narrow sepals that are often mistaken for petals. Stellaria flaccida is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
