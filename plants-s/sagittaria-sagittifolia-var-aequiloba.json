    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. aequiloba, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with narrow, grass-like leaves submerged beneath the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and marshes. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
