    "intro": "Styphelia parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers during the cooler months, usually from June to August. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Styphelia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture and contrast to garden landscapes."
