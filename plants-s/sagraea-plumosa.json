    "intro": "Sagraea plumosa, commonly known as the silver feather plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage that gives it its common name. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-blue hue due to fine, soft hairs covering the surface. Sagraea plumosa produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
