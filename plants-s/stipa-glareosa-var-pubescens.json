    "intro": "Stipa glareosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and feathery, silver-gray inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and often covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name. This plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soil conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
