    "intro": "Saribus surru, commonly known as the giant panda palm, is a strikingly tall and slender palm native to Madagascar. It features a tall, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, nutty flavor. Saribus surru is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires full sun to thrive. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
