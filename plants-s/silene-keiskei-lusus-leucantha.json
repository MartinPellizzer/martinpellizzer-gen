    "intro": "Silene keiskei lusus leucantha, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a strikingly white-flowered plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white petals and short, hairy stems. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
