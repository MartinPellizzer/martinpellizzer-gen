    "intro": "Strobilacanthus lepidospermus, commonly known as the African cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous bark. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that are typically dark green in color. This ancient plant is adapted to arid environments and can survive for many years without flowering."
