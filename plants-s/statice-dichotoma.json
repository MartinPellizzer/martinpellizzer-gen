    "intro": "Statice dichotoma, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime environments. Its narrow, gray-green leaves are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Statice dichotoma is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in floral arrangements and as a natural dye source."
