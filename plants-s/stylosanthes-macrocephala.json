    "intro": "Stylosanthes macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed stylo, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in small, hairy pods, and the plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Stylosanthes macrocephala is widely used in forage systems and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
