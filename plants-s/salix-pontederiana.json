    "intro": "Salix pontederiana, commonly known as the water willow, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems that often grow in water or moist soil. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface. Salix pontederiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
