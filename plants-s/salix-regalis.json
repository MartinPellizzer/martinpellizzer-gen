    "intro": "Salix regalis, commonly known as the royal willow, is a species of willow native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces small, woody fruits. Salix regalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in stabilizing riverbanks through its extensive root system."
