    "intro": "Symplocos chinensis, commonly known as Chinese wax tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos chinensis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
