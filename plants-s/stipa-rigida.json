    "intro": "Stipa rigida, commonly known as rigid grass or needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Stipa rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
