    "intro": "Stemeiena, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, butterfly-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Stemeiena thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections."
