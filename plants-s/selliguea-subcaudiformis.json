    "intro": "Selliguea subcaudiformis, commonly known as the long-tailed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive elongated, ribbon-like structure with a narrow, tapering shape. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral and are covered with a thick layer of cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Selliguea subcaudiformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
