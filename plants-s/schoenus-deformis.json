    "intro": "Schoenus deformis, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often slightly curved, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Schoenus deformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
