    "intro": "Spiraea inebrians, commonly known as the intoxicating spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its showy, flat-topped clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The common name \"intoxicating\" likely refers to the plant's pleasant fragrance, which is said to be reminiscent of wine or other intoxicating substances."
