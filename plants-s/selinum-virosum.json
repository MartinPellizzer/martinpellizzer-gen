It is a low-growing perennial herb with thin, creeping stems and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called caryopses, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are aromatic and have been used historically in herbal medicine."
