    "intro": "Stachys recta subsp. arenariiformis, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces spikes of tiny, violet or blue flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
