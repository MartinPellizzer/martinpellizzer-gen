    "intro": "Stipa gobica var. klemenzii, commonly known as Klemenzii's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of fine, silver-green foliage that create a striking visual effect in gardens. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale yellow to golden flowers in late summer, adding a soft, airy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
