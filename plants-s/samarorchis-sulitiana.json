    "intro": "Samarorchis sulitiana, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Samarorchis sulitiana is considered critically endangered."
