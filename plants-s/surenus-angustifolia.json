    "intro": "Surenus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf surenus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stems, with a grayish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss. Small, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is adapted to hot, dry conditions and is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry streambeds."
