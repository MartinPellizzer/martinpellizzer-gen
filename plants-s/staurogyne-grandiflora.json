    "intro": "Staurogyne grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower waterweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Staurogyne grandiflora thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic plant for water gardens and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
