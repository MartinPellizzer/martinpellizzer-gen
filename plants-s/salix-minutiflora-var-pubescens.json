    "intro": "Salix minutiflora var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in catkins during the spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
