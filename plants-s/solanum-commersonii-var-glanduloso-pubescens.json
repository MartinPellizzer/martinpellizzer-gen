    "intro": "Solanum commersonii var. glanduloso-pubescens, commonly known as the glandular-hairy nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in temperate regions of Argentina and Chile."
