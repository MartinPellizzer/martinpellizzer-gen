    "intro": "Smilax polyantha, commonly known as the fragrant smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and thorny tendrils that help it climb other plants or structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often fragrant, especially in the evening. Its fruits are red berries that mature in the fall and are edible for some wildlife. Smilax polyantha is often found in moist woodlands and is known for its hardy, persistent growth."
