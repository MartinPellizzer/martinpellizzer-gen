    "intro": "Stravadium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an ethereal glow under sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during the night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Stravadium is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of ongoing scientific study."
