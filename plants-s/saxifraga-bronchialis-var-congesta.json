    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. The plant features compact rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters during the short growing season, adding a delicate touch to its harsh habitat. This variety is notable for its resilience to cold climates and its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
