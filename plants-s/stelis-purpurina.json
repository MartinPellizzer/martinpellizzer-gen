    "intro": "Stelis purpurina, commonly known as the purple stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots for nutrient absorption. The plant features a short, compact stem with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive purple and white coloration, and are borne in loose inflorescences. Stelis purpurina thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
