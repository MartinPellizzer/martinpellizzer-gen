It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune habitats. It is a perennial species that produces seeds in late summer, which are dispersed by the wind. Statice setigera is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
