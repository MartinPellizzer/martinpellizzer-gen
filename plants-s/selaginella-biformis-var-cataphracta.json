It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in rocky or arid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in two rows along the stems. It is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of certain desert and semi-arid ecosystems."
