    "intro": "Salicornia cruciata, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and estuarine areas. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are scale-like and often reduced, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Salicornia cruciata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
