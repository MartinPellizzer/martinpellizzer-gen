    "intro": "Schizonotus argenteus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine silverweed, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
