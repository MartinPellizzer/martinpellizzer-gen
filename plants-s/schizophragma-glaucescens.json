    "intro": "Schizophragma glaucescens, commonly known as the blue honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
