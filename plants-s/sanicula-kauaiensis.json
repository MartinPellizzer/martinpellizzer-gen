It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of Hawaiian rainforests. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces fruit that disperses seeds via wind. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
