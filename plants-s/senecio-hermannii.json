    "intro": "Senecio hermannii, commonly known as Hermann's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it has a compact, low-growing habit. Senecio hermannii is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
