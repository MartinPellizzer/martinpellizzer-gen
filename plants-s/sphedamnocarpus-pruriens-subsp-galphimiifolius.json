    "intro": "Sphedamnocarpus pruriens subsp. galphimiifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges that are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its stems are hollow and often have a reddish tinge, and the plant is known for its irritant properties due to the presence of urushiol-like compounds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
