    "intro": "Stutzia dioica, commonly known as the two-flowered stutzia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers on separate spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found in the southeastern United States. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Stutzia dioica plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
