    "intro": "Salix malifolia, commonly known as the sweet willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin strips, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix malifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion."
