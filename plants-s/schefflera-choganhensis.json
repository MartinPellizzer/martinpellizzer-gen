    "intro": "Schefflera choganhensis, commonly known as the Choghan Mountain Schefflera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of compound leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within its restricted habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a distinctive veining pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
