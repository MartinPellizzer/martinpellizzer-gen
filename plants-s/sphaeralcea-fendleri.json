    "intro": "Sphaeralcea fendleri, commonly known as desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea fendleri is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
