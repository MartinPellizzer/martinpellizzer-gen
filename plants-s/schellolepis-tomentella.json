It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it thrives in shallow, still waters. Schellolepis tomentella is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic insects. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study."
