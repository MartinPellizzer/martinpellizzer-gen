    "intro": "Solanum interandinum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often found in wild, less disturbed areas of the Andes."
