It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Sarcoglottis acutata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
