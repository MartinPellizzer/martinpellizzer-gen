    "intro": "Sideroxylon arboreum, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or green. The plant produces a distinctive, milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
