It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.

Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
