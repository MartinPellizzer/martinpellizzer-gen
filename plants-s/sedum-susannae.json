    "intro": "Sedum susannae, commonly known as Susan's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum susannae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
