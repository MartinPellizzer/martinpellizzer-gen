    "intro": "Scirpus americanus var. pungens, commonly known as the spiked bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spadix-like flowers at the top of its stem, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette at the base. This species is adapted to marshy soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
