    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. bukobense, commonly known as the Bukoban nightshade, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, particularly Tanzania. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, forested areas and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow when mature. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids. It is often found in shaded understory environments and is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae."
