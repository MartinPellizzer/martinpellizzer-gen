    "intro": "Styrax trichocalyx, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark red, fleshy berries. Its sap, known as \"shen zhi,\" has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
