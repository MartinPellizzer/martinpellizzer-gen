It is characterized by its large, showy, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and purple. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are borne on the trunk and branches, a feature known as cauliflory. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Stylogyne cauliflora is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
