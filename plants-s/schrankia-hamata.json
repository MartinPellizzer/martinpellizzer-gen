    "intro": "Schrankia hamata, commonly known as the narrowleaf schrankia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Schrankia hamata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
