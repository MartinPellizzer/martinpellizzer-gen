    "intro": "Selaginella axillifolia var. retroflexa, commonly known as the retroflex spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory plant communities in its native habitat."
