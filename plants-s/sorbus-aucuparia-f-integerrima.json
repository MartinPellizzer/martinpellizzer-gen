    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. integerrima, commonly known as the white-tailed mountain ash, is a variant of the rowan tree characterized by its distinctive white fruit clusters. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical species, with leaves that are generally more rounded and less serrated. The plant is native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruit, which matures to a bright red or orange color, is an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The white-tailed mountain ash is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
