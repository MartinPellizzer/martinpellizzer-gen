The plant has a thalloid structure with a central axis and lateral branches, and its leaves are usually small and closely arranged. Sphaerostigma parvulum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems. It is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions in moist habitats."
