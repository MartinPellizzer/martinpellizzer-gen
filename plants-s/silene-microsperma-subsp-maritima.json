It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shores and dunes, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
