    "intro": "Stellilabium hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy labium orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped floral structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Its flowers, which are usually a mix of white and green, are adorned with fine, hairy textures on the labellum, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
