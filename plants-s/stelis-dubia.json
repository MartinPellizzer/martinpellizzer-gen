    "intro": "Stelis dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers are usually fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stelis dubia is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
