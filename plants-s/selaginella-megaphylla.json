    "intro": "Selaginella megaphylla, commonly known as the giant spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves and a distinct, branching stem structure. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and resilience."
