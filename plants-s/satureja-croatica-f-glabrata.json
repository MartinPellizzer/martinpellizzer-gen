    "intro": "Satureja croatica f. glabrata, commonly known as Croatian savory, is a subspecies of the mountain savory plant native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, greenish-yellow flowers and its preference for rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in high-altitude areas and is well adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are used in traditional cuisine and herbal medicine for their pungent, slightly spicy flavor. This subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves, which set it apart from other forms of Satureja croatica."
