    "intro": "Stipa pubescens var. auricoma, commonly known as the golden beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, golden-yellow inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The variety auricoma is distinguished by its more pronounced golden coloration compared to the typical form of S. pubescens."
