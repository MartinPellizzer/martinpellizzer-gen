    "intro": "Stipa dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Stipa dusenii is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species in its native range."
