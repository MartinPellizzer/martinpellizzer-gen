It is a hybrid between Stipa capillata and Stipa trachychlamys, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense, tussock-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. Stipa \u00d7 zaissanica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of steppe ecosystems."
