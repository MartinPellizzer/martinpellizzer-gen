    "intro": "Serratula salina, commonly known as salt marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western United States. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt. Serratula salina is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations and periodic flooding. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
