    "intro": "Sporobolus nervosus, commonly known as hairy bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are often pink to red in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its rhizomes allow it to form clumps or colonies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Sporobolus nervosus is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped landscapes."
