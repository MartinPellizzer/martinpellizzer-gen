    "intro": "Sonchus laevissimus, commonly known as the smooth sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, spiky seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
