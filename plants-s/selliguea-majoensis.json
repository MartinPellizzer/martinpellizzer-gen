    "intro": "Selliguea majoensis, commonly known as the Majoensis liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the thallus. Selliguea majoensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem."
