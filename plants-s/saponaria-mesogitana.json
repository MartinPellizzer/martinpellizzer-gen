    "intro": "Saponaria mesogitana, commonly known as the Cyprus soaproot, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which can produce a soap-like lather when mixed with water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Saponaria mesogitana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
