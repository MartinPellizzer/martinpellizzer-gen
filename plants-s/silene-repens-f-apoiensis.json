    "intro": "Silene repens f. apoiensis, commonly known as the creeping catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its fleshy, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. It is native to the Appalachian region of the United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant's leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are typically arranged in clusters and attract pollinators like bees and moths. Silene repens f. apoiensis is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its distinctive floral structures and adaptations to moist, temperate climates."
