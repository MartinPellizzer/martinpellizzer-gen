    "intro": "Sarcoclinium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved sarcoclinium, is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are elongated, leathery, and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable plant for woodland gardens. This plant is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
