    "intro": "Silene transalpina, commonly known as the Transalpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Silene transalpina is often found in meadows and scree slopes at high elevations."
