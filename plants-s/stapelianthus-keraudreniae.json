It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces a strong, sweet scent, which attracts pollinators such as moths and flies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
