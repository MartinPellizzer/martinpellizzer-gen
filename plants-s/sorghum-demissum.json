    "intro": "Sorghum demissum, commonly known as the slender sorghum, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Sorghum demissum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
