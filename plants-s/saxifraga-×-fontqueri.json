    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 fontqueri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. Saxifraga \u00d7 fontqueri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging habitats."
