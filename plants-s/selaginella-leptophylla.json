    "intro": "Selaginella leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often less than 1 cm in length, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. Selaginella leptophylla reproduces via spores, which are produced in structures called strobila at the tips of its stems. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
