    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salix ledeburiana, commonly known as the Ledebour's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic wildlife. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in colder climates as an ornamental plant."
