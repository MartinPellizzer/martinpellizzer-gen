It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a white or pale green waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Saxifraga punctata subsp. nelsoniana is adapted to cold climates and has a compact growth habit that helps it survive harsh winter conditions."
