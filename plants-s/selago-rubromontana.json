    "intro": "Selago rubromontana, commonly known as the red mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear red-brown florets, giving it its common name. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Selago rubromontana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
