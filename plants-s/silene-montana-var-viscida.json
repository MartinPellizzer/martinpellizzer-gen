    "intro": "Silene montana var. viscida, commonly known as sticky mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
