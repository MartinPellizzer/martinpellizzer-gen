    "intro": "Sisymbrium langei, commonly known as the Lange's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked."
