It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
