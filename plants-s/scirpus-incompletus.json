It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Scirpus incompletus forms dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
