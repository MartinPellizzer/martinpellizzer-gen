    "intro": "Sarcanthus gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky coastal areas of southern Norway. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in harsh, sandy environments and is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. Sarcanthus gjellerupii is classified as a member of the Montiaceae family and is known for its unique ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
