    "intro": "Solanum cervantesii var. erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but may serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
