    "intro": "Stenogrammitis nutata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stenogrammitis, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with the youngest leaves at the center and older ones radiating outward. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
