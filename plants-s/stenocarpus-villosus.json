    "intro": "Stenocarpus villosus, commonly known as the hairy tallowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or dry forest habitats. Stenocarpus villosus is valued for its hard, durable timber and is also appreciated for its ornamental appeal."
