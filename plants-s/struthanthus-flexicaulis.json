It is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.
