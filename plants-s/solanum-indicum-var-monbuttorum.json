    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. monbuttorum, commonly known as the Indian nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
