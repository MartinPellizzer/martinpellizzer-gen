    "intro": "Semiaquilegia guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi semiwaterleaf, is a rare and endemic species native to southern China. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its botanical features include stipitate stems and compound leaves with pinnate divisions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
