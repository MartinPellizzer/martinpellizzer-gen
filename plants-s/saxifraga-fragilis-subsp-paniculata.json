It thrives in rocky and barren environments, often found in alpine tundras and mountainous areas. The plant features delicate, hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. Its growth habit is characterized by a rosette of leaves with upright flowering stems. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
