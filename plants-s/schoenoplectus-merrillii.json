    "intro": "Schoenoplectus merrillii, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits that disperse via water. Schoenoplectus merrillii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
