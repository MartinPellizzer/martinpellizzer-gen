    "intro": "Sporobolus affinis, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, warm-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has fibrous roots and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the leaf blades. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for landscaping in dry regions. Sporobolus affinis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
