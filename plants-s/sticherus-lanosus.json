    "intro": "Sticherus lanosus, commonly known as the woolly sticherus, is a small, perennial herb belonging to the family Stichyaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense pubescence. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or white, and are arranged in clusters."
