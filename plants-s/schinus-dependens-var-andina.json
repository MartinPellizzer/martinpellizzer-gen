    "intro": "Schinus dependens var. andina, commonly known as the Andean beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright purple berries that appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The berries are edible for some animals but are generally not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste."
