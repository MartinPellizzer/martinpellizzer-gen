    "intro": "Stachys aspera var. tenuiflora, commonly known as narrow-flowered hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or violet in color. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
