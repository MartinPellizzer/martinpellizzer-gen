    "intro": "Selliguea glaucopsis, commonly known as the glaucous rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Selliguea glaucopsis is well adapted to moist, acidic environments and is often seen in mountainous regions."
