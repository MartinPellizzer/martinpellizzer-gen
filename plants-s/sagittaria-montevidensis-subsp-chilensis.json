    "intro": "Sagittaria montevidensis subsp. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, with long, slender stems that support its flowering shoots. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, and is often found in shallow water. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
