    "intro": "Stipa lahittei, commonly known as the Lahti's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bract-like structures, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa lahittei plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant appearance."
