It belongs to the genus Sarcoca within the family Cactaceae, though it is not a true cactus in the traditional sense. The plant is characterized by its segmented stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in winter. Its leaves are usually arranged in a zigzag pattern, and it produces bright red, orange, or yellow flowers. Sarcoca dodecandra is popular as a decorative plant due to its long blooming period and ease of care."
