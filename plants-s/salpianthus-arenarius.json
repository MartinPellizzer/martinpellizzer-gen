    "intro": "Salpianthus arenarius, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Salpianthus arenarius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
