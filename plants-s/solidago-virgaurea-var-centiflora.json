    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. centiflora, commonly known as the centiflower goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, panicle-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream sides. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators during the late summer and early autumn."
