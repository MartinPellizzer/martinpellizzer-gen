    "intro": "Saxifraga zayuensis f. angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-petioled saxifrage, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
