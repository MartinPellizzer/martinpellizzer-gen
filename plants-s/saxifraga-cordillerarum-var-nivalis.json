    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerarum var. nivalis, commonly known as the Sierra snow saxifraga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh conditions. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid, high-altitude habitats. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and its ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions."
