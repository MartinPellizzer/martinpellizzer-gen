    "intro": "Salix cuneata f. obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lanceolate to obovate leaves, which are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of willow species, with both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
