    "intro": "Salsola macrophylla, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that reduce water loss and a deep root system for accessing groundwater. It is an invasive species in many regions, often forming dense stands that outcompete native vegetation. Salsola macrophylla produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
