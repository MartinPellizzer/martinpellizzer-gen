    "intro": "Stemodia pedicellaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stemodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense mats, making it well adapted to sandy or coastal soils. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
