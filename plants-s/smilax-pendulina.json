    "intro": "Smilax pendulina, commonly known as the trailing smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that often trail along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have spines along the edges. Smilax pendulina is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
