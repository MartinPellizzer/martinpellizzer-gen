It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed, orange-red fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, yellow aril, which gives the plant its common name.
