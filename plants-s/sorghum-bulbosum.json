    "intro": "Sorghum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous sorghum, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces large, bulb-like structures at the base of its stems, which are used for propagation. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Sorghum bulbosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical significance in traditional medicine."
