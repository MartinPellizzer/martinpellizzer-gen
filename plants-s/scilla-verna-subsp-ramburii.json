    "intro": "Scilla verna subsp. ramburii, commonly known as the spring squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates. The subspecies ramburii is distinguished by its slightly different flower coloration and growth habits compared to the typical form of Scilla verna."
