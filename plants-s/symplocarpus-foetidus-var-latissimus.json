    "intro": "Symplocarpus foetidus var. latissimus, commonly known as swamp buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and thrive in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in its flowers and roots."
