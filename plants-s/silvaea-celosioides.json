    "intro": "Silvaea celosioides, commonly known as the silky sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the summer months. Silvaea celosioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
