    "intro": "Senecio yesoensis, commonly known as the Yeso groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms low, mat-like growths to withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters. Senecio yesoensis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with limited soil and high solar exposure."
