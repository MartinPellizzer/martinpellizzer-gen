    "intro": "Stigmatodactylus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Africa and are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers. They typically have opposite leaves and produce milky sap, which can be toxic to animals and humans. Stigmatodactylus species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent stems. The flowers are usually tubular or spurred, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and birds."
