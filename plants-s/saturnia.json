    "intro": "Saturnia, commonly known as the Saturnian moth or the Saturnia pisi, is a species of moth belonging to the family Saturniidae. The plant associated with Saturnia is the mulberry tree, which serves as the primary food source for its larvae. The caterpillars of Saturnia pisi are known for their distinctive appearance, featuring a striking coloration with orange and black patterns. These larvae feed on the leaves of the mulberry tree, contributing to the ecological dynamics of their habitat. The life cycle of Saturnia is closely tied to the seasonal growth of its host plant."
