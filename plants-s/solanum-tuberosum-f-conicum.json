    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. conicum, commonly known as the conical potato, is a unique cultivar of the potato plant characterized by its distinctive conical shape. This variety exhibits a compact growth habit with tubers that develop in a tightly clustered, cone-like formation. The foliage is typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is well-suited for smaller garden spaces. It is prized for its ornamental value as well as its edible tubers, which have a slightly sweeter flavor compared to standard potatoes. The conical form makes it an interesting choice for both culinary use and horticultural display."
