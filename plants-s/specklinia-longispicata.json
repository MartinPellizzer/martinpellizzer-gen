    "intro": "Specklinia longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, with distinctive long, spiky structures at the base of each bloom. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
