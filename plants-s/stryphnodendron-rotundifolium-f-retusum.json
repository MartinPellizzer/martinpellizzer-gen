    "intro": "Stryphnodendron rotundifolium f. retusum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a variant of the Brazilian rosewood tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, oily texture, making it highly valued in musical instrument making. The leaves are elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly wavy margin, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and demand, it is often subject to conservation concerns."
