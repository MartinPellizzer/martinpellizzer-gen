It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.
