    "intro": "Schizachyrium multinervosum, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated conditions."
