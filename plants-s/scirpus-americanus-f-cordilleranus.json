    "intro": "Scirpus americanus f. cordilleranus, commonly known as the Pacific reed or western bulrush, is a variant of the common reed native to North America. It is a tall, perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has cylindrical, hollow stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grass family plants. This subspecies is adapted to a wide range of moist environments and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
