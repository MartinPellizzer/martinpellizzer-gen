It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties, and the wood is valued for its durability and workability. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common understory plant in dense forest ecosystems."
