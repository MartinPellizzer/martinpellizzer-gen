    "intro": "Sedum oblongorhizum, commonly known as the broadroot stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its ability to store water in its roots allows it to survive in dry conditions."
