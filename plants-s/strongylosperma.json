    "intro": "Strongylosperma, commonly known as the sandburs, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various parts of the Americas and are characterized by their distinctive burrs that cling to animal fur. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets, and the flowers are small and clustered in racemes. Strongylosperma species are often found in sandy or disturbed soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. They play a role in soil stabilization and are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
