    "intro": "Stellaria multiflora, commonly known as mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features small, white flowers with four petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. Stellaria multiflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and runners."
