    "intro": "Stipagrostis pungens subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually terminal and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
