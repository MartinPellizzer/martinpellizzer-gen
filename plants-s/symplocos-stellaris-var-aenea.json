    "intro": "Symplocos stellaris var. aenea, commonly known as the silverleaf starshade, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a glossy, silver-green upper surface and a darker underside. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas."
