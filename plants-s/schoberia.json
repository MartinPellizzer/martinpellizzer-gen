    "intro": "Schoberia, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often thriving in rocky or alpine environments. Schoberia species typically feature showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale pink petals. They are perennial herbs that produce small, achene-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The genus is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a common sight in mountainous and dry habitats."
