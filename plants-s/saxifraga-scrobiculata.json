    "intro": "Saxifraga scrobiculata, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer. It is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. Saxifraga scrobiculata is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh environments."
