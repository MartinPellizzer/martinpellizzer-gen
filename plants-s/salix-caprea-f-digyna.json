    "intro": "Salix caprea f. digyna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet woodlands. This form is distinguished from the typical Salix caprea by its narrower leaves and more compact growth structure."
