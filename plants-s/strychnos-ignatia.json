    "intro": "Strychnos ignatia, commonly known as the Indian apple or devil's apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain the seeds, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. Strychnos ignatia is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which have historically been used in medicinal and even lethal applications."
