    "intro": "Strychnos niederleinii, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, elongated pods that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, red aril. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
