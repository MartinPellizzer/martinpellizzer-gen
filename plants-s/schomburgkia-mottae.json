Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-pink flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish.
