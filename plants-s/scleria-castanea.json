    "intro": "Scleria castanea, commonly known as the chestnut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and riverbanks. Its stems are triangular in cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Scleria castanea produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, and it is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
