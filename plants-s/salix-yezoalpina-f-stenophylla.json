It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
