    "intro": "Spergularia longipes var. langeana, commonly known as the Lange's sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
