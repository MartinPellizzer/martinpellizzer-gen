    "intro": "Stipa cacheutensis, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often pale green to brown in color. Stipa cacheutensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, mountainous habitat."
