    "intro": "Schinus hexandra, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, red berries. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
