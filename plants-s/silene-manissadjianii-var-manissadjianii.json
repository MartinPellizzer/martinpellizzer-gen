    "intro": "Silene manissadjianii var. manissadjianii, commonly known as the Armenian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are often arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
