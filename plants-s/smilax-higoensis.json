    "intro": "Smilax higoensis, commonly known as the Higo Smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils that help it climb and spread. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and often consumed by various bird species. Smilax higoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
