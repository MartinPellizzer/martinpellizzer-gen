It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular blue or purple flowers. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
