    "intro": "Stelis violascens, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a pleasant fragrance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis violascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
