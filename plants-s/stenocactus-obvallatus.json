    "intro": "Stenocactus obvallatus, commonly known as the \"tulip cactus,\" is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that often branches into multiple stems, forming a bushy appearance. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that resemble tulips, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Stenocactus obvallatus is well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
