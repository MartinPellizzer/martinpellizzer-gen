    "intro": "Salsola tetrandra, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in arid and saline environments due to its deep root system and ability to retain water. It often forms dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Salsola tetrandra plays a role in stabilizing soils but is also considered invasive in some regions."
