    "intro": "Schoenoplectus trisetosus, commonly known as the three-bristled bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has tall, slender stems that are often covered with short, stiff hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems. Schoenoplectus trisetosus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
