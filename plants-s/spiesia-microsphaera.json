    "intro": "Spiesia microsphaera, commonly known as the small sphere lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a thin, crust-like growth on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, granular structures. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria for photosynthesis. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or on tree trunks. Spiesia microsphaera plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
