    "intro": "Serruria multifida, commonly known as the many-lobed serruria, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate and intricate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a red or orange throat. Serruria multifida is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its ornamental value and adaptability to cultivation."
