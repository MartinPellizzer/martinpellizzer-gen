    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tarabucoensis subsp. hertusii, commonly known as the Tarabuco cushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Andes of Bolivia. It features a dense rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green to gray-green stems that store water, typical of its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
