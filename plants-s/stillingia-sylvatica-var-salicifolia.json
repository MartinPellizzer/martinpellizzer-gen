    "intro": "Stillingia sylvatica var. salicifolia, commonly known as the American stellaria, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. This variety is closely related to the common stellaria, but it differs in its leaf shape and habitat preference. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
