    "intro": "Scrophularia morisii, commonly known as Moris' figwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces showy, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scrophularia morisii is considered a rare and endangered species."
