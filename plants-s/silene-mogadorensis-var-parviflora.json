    "intro": "Silene mogadorensis var. parviflora, commonly known as the Mogador silene, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and has a low, spreading habit with hairy stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to other varieties of Silene mogadorensis."
