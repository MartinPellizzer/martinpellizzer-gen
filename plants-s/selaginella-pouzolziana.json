It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella pouzolziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
