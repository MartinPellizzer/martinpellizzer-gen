    "intro": "Soldanella pusilla var. parviflora, commonly known as the small bellflower, is a diminutive herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its small size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
