    "intro": "Stelis apiculifera, commonly known as the apiculate stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Stelis apiculifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth."
