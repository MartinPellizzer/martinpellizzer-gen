    "intro": "Stapelia aperta, commonly known as the open-stemmed African milkwort, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, fleshy, and often branched stem that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is adapted to arid environments. Stapelia aperta is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
