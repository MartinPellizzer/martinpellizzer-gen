    "intro": "Solanum paradoxum, commonly known as the paradoxical nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
