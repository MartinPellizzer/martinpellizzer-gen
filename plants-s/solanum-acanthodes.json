It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruits are berries that start green and turn red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
