It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, green fruits with a soft, edible pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow or red, and it has a mild, sweet flavor. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine and as a food source."
