    "intro": "Sapium ovalifolium, commonly known as Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
