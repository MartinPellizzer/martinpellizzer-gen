    "intro": "Sarothamnus welwitschii var. gallecicus, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
