    "intro": "Saxifraga crassifolia var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
