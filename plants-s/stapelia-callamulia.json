    "intro": "Stapelia callamulia, commonly known as the \"corpse flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often described as resembling decaying flesh, a trait that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its flowers are typically yellowish-green with prominent veins, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. Stapelia callamulia is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
