    "intro": "Spiranthes transversalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
