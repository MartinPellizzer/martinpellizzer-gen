    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
