It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Schefflera pushpangadanii is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
