It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
