    "intro": "Stellaria media proles apetala, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and apetalous flowers. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and a basal rosette structure. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that lack petals, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and runners, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
