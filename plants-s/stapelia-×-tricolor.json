    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 tricolor, commonly known as the three-color stapelia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which are pollinated by flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Stapelia \u00d7 tricolor is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
