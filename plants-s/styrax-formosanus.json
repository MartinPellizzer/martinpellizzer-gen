    "intro": "Styrax formosanus, commonly known as the Formosan styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the white blooms. Styrax formosanus thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
