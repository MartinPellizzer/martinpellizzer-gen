    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos pedicellatum var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered stenorrhynchos, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces long, slender pedicels that bear the blooms, which are often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
