    "intro": "Senegalia suma, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, cylindrical pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine. Senegalia suma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
