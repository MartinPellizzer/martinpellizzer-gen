    "intro": "Saxifraga caerulea, commonly known as the blue saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, basal leaves and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Saxifraga caerulea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
