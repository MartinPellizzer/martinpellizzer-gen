    "intro": "Selaginella kusaiensis, commonly known as the Kusai clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are small, linear, and arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces spores in specialized structures called sporophylls. Selaginella kusaiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme conditions."
