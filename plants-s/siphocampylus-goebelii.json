    "intro": "Siphocampylus goebelii, commonly known as the Goebel's siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
