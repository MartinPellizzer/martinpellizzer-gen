    "intro": "Scirpus dissachanthus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its root system helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus dissachanthus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
