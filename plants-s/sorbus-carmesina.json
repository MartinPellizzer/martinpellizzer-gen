    "intro": "Sorbus carmesina, commonly known as the white-berried rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and showy fruit display. Sorbus carmesina is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
