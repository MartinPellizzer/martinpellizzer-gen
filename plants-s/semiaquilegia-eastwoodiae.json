    "intro": "Semiaquilegia eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's semiaquilegia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are finely toothed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
