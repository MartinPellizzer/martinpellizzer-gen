    "intro": "Siphocampylus, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. These plants are typically herbaceous and are native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. They are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which can range in color from blue to purple, and their ability to thrive in rocky or alpine environments. Siphocampylus species often have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
