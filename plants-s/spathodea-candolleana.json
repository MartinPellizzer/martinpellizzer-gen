    "intro": "Spathodea candolleana, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a tropical tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a distinct midrib. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
