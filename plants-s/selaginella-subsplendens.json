    "intro": "Selaginella subsplendens, commonly known as the glittering spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
