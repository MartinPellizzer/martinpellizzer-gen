    "intro": "Scirpus robustus f. protrusus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems and broad, flat leaves that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered brown flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
