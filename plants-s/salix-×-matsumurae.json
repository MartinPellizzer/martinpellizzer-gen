    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 matsumurae, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy surface. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
