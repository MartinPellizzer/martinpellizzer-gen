    "intro": "Spiranthes \u00d7 zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the Zahnbuckner's spike-rush, is a hybrid orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its flowers have a spiral arrangement, a feature typical of many Spiranthes species, which aids in pollination by insects. The plant is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions, making it a popular choice for gardeners interested in native orchids."
