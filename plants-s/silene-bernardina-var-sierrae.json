    "intro": "Silene bernardina var. sierrae, commonly known as Sierra Bernardina, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. It is a herbaceous perennial with showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine meadows. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Silene bernardina var. sierrae is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh mountain environment."
