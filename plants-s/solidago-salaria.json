It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Solidago salaria plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late season."
