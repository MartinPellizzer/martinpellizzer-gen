    "intro": "Stenocereus stellatus var. tenellianus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by birds and bats. The species is well-suited to xerophytic environments and requires minimal water once established."
