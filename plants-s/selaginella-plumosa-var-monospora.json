    "intro": "Selaginella plumosa var. monospora, commonly known as the feather moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and the presence of small, scale-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
