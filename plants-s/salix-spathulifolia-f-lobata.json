    "intro": "Salix spathulifolia f. lobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate to broadly ovate leaves, which are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, typical of willow species, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
