    "intro": "Scilla squamosa, commonly known as the squamosa scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and are also cultivated for ornamental purposes. Scilla squamosa is relatively easy to grow in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
