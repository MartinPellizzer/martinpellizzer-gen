    "intro": "Sticherus remotus, commonly known as the remote sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring wiry stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by efficiently absorbing and storing water. Sticherus remotus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall."
