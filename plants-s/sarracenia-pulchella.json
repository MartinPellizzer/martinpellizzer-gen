    "intro": "Sarracenia pulchella, commonly known as the white whorled sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands in eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, whorled leaves that form a rosette, which are covered in sticky glands that trap insects. The plant produces tall, red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trapping mechanism is primarily passive, relying on the adhesion of insects to the glandular surfaces rather than active movement. Sarracenia pulchella thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
