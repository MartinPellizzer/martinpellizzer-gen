It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is notable for its showy inflorescence and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
