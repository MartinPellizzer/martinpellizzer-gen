    "intro": "Stilifolium stacyi, commonly known as the Stacy's stiltgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to certain regions of North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils. Stilifolium stacyi is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments."
