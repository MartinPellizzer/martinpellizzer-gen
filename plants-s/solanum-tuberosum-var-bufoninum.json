    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. bufoninum, commonly known as the poison potato, is a variant of the common potato with distinct botanical characteristics. It is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to South America. The plant features tuberous roots that are typically smaller and more irregularly shaped compared to standard potatoes. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries. This variant is notable for its toxic compounds, particularly solanine, which makes it unsuitable for human consumption."
