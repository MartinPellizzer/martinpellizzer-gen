    "intro": "Senefeldera grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered senefeldera, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which is characterized by its inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its humid environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, with the spadix bearing both male and female reproductive structures. Senefeldera grandifolia is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and wetlands."
