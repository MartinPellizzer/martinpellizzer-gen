    "intro": "Senecio globigerus, commonly known as the globigerous groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a succulent perennial that forms dense, low-growing mats with thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio globigerus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
