    "intro": "Smilax senticosa, commonly known as the prickly pear or sweet flag, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Smilax senticosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its hardy, persistent nature."
