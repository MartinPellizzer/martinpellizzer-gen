It produces large, showy flowers with numerous petals, giving it a more ornamental appearance compared to the single-flowered varieties. The plant is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet, featuring dark green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Syringa vulgaris var. plena is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
