    "intro": "Sisyrinchium minense, commonly known as the narrowleaf blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Sisyrinchium minense is also an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
