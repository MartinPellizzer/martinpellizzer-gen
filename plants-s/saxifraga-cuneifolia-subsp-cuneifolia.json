    "intro": "Saxifraga cuneifolia subsp. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous environments where it forms dense mats or low-growing clusters. The plant has alternate, linear to narrowly elliptic leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. Its small, pink to white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and has a rosette growth form that helps it conserve moisture and withstand harsh weather conditions."
