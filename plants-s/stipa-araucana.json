    "intro": "Stipa araucana, commonly known as the Andean feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-green plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets. Stipa araucana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
