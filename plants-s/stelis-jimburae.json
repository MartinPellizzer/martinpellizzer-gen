    "intro": "Stelis jimburae, commonly known as the Jimbura orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
