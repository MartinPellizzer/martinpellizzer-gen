    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 chelsonii, commonly known as the Chelson's pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, tubular pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps, where it can absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Its pitchers are typically red or orange with a green or brown pattern, which helps attract prey. This hybrid is prized by growers for its striking appearance and unique ecological adaptations."
