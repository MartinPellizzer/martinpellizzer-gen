    "intro": "Salix hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually inconspicuous. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The bark of Salix hookeriana is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance."
