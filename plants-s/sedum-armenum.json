    "intro": "Sedum armenum, commonly known as Armenian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountains of the Caucasus region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum armenum is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
