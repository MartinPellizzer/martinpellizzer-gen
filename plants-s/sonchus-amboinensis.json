It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with alternate, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
