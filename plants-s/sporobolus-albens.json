    "intro": "Sporobolus albens, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and often found in prairie and coastal dune ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage makes it ecologically and agriculturally significant."
