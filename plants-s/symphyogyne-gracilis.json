    "intro": "Symphyogyne gracilis, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, forming dense clumps with slender, arching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slight sheen. Symphyogyne gracilis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
