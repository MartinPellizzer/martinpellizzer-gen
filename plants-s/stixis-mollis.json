    "intro": "Stixis mollis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed stixis, is a flowering plant native to the humid regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stixis mollis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical rainforests or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
