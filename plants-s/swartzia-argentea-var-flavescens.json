    "intro": "Swartzia argentea var. flavescens, commonly known as the silverwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
