It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
