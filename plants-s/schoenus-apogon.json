    "intro": "Schoenus apogon, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often mistaken for true grasses, but it has distinct floral structures typical of sedges. Schoenus apogon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
