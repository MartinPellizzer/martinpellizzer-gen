    "intro": "Stylapterus ericoides, commonly known as the creeping heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Stylapterus ericoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
