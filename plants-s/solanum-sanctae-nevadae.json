    "intro": "Solanum sanctae-nevadae, commonly known as the Neveda nightshade, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, followed by berries that mature to a dark red or black hue. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
