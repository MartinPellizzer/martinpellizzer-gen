    "intro": "Selliguea soridens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky substrates. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and instead has a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its thallus. Selliguea soridens is often found in temperate regions and is an important indicator species for certain types of ecosystems."
