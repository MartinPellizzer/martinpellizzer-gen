    "intro": "Statice capitata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in saline and well-drained soils. It is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and salt tolerance. Statice capitata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
