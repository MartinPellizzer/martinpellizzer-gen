    "intro": "Selaginella lasiophylla, commonly known as the forked clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Australia. It has a distinctive appearance with its branching, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its sporophylls are arranged in spirals, and it produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures. Selaginella lasiophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
