    "intro": "Serianthes kanehirae var. yapensis, commonly known as the Yap ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species with significant ecological and cultural importance to the local communities."
