    "intro": "Sticherus ovatus, commonly known as the oval sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitats."
