    "intro": "Salix pseudocordata var. aequalis, commonly known as the equal-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold and harsh conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
