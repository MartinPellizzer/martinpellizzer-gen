It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with needle-like leaves that are typically long and slender. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
