    "intro": "Stapelia emarginata, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, odorless flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a trait that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting the plant from herbivores. Stapelia emarginata is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
