    "intro": "Sauvagesia nana, commonly known as dwarf sauvagesia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact growth with small, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by small, orange-red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used as a decorative plant in Mediterranean-style gardens."
