    "intro": "Selaginella geniculata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is noted for its dense, mat-forming growth and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
