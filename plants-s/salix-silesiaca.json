    "intro": "Salix silesiaca, commonly known as the Silesian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
