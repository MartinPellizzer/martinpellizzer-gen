    "intro": "Sulcolluma hexagona, commonly known as the hexagonal liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive hexagonal leaf structures, which give it its scientific name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its simple morphology includes leafy shoots and a thalloid body, typical of many liverworts. Sulcolluma hexagona plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
