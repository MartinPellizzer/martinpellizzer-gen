    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea var. typica, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-tinged leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's leaves are typically upright and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The nectar-producing glands on the leaf surface attract prey, which then slips into the digestive fluid at the base of the trap."
