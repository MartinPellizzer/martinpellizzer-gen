    "intro": "Sorghum centroplicatum var. dubium, commonly known as the narrowleaf sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum genus native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stalks and narrow leaves, which are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in grasslands and savannas. This species is valued for its resilience to drought and its potential use in both forage and grain production."
