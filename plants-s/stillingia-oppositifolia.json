    "intro": "Stillingia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved stillingia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves and produces striking red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
