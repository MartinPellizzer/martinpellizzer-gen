    "intro": "Spiraea hirsuta var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a slightly serrated margin, and they turn a striking red or orange in the fall. This variety is prized for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
