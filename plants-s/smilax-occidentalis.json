    "intro": "Smilax occidentalis, commonly known as western greenbrier, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively in woodland habitats. Smilax occidentalis is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
