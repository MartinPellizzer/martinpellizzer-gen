    "intro": "Sparganium subvaginatum, commonly known as the narrow sheath bur-reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often sheathed at the base, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Sparganium subvaginatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
