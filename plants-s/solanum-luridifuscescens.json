    "intro": "Solanum luridifuscescens, commonly known as the yellow-leaved nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically oval with a waxy texture. Its fruit is a small, yellowish berry that contains several seeds. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not suitable for human consumption but is of interest to botanists and researchers."
