    "intro": "Salix sugawarana, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
