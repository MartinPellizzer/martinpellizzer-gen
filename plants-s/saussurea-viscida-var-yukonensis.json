    "intro": "Saussurea viscida var. yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon sandverbena, is a perennial herb native to the Yukon and northern Alberta regions of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. It has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species in arctic and subarctic environments. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a component of the local flora in its native range."
