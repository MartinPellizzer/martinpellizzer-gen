    "intro": "Suaeda maritima var. malacosperma, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, aiding survival in arid coastal regions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a thick, fleshy coating that aids in dispersal by water and animals. This variety is often found in sandy or muddy shores, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
