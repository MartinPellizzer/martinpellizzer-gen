    "intro": "Sorbaria tomentosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silky spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage that gives it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early to mid-summer, which are followed by small, red berries. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
