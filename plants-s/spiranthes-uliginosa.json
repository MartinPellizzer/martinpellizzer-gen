    "intro": "Spiranthes uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Spiranthes uliginosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
