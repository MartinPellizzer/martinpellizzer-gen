    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon, commonly known as the \"sacred plant\" or \"devil's tongue,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, often colorful, bracts that resemble tongues or lips. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, thriving on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Stigmaphyllon species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
