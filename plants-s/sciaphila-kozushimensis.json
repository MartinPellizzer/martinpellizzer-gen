    "intro": "Sciaphila kozushimensis, commonly known as the Kozushimen ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture limited light in its understory habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
