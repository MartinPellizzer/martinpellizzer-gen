    "intro": "Styphelia trichocarpa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal fog zones where it benefits from the cool, humid climate. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Styphelia trichocarpa is well adapted to coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps it withstand strong winds and salt spray. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
