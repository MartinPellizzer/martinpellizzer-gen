    "intro": "Stachycarpus utilior, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-white flowers, which are followed by triangular, three-angled berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid habitat."
