    "intro": "Sclerolaena fontinalis, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It has slender, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats. Sclerolaena fontinalis plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of freshwater ecosystems."
