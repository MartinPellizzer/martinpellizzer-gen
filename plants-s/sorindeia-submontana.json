    "intro": "Sorindeia submontana, commonly known as the mountain sorindeia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
