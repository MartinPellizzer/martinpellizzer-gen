    "intro": "Sulcorebutia confusa, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" cactus, is a compact, globular plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a short, ribbed stem with dense, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
