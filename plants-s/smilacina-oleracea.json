    "intro": "Smilacina oleracea, commonly known as false Solomon's seal, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features arching stems with clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated margin. Smilacina oleracea thrives in shady, moist woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils."
