It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and reducing erosion. The plant has long, slender blades and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It is highly tolerant of tidal inundation and can survive in waterlogged conditions. Spartina phleoides is an important component of salt marsh ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
