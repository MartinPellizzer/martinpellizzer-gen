    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 beckiana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. The bark of Salix \u00d7 beckiana is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
