    "intro": "Selaginella gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich environments. Selaginella gypsophila is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its ability to retain water in its tissues. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
