    "intro": "Salix seemenii, commonly known as the Chinese willow or the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups and serve as the primary means of reproduction. Its leaves and bark contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine. Salix seemenii is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold climates."
