    "intro": "Syzygium kudatense, commonly known as the kudateng or kudatense apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glossy bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, apple-like fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a deep red or purple color, indicating maturity. Syzygium kudatense is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal properties."
