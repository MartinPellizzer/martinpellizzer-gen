    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, ascending stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of mountain vegetation in its native range."
