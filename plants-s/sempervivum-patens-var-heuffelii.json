    "intro": "Sempervivum patens var. heuffelii, commonly known as the Heuffel's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Alps. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powdery bloom. The plant produces tall, branched stems with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it an excellent ground cover in arid environments."
