It is characterized by its stout, thorned stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating. Smilax tortuosa is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade."
