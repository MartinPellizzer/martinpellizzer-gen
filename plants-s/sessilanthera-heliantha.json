    "intro": "Sessilanthera heliantha, commonly known as the sunflower daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing numerous small, daisy-like flowers on short stalks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established. Sessilanthera heliantha is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun."
