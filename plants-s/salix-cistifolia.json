    "intro": "Salix cistifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Salix cistifolia is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
