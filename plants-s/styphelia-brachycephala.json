    "intro": "Styphelia brachycephala, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the moist, acidic soils of the Pacific Northwest. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate beauty to its foliage. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded conditions and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
