    "intro": "Stelis segoviensis, commonly known as the Segovia orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Stelis segoviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
