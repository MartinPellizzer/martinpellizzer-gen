    "intro": "Smilax spruceana, commonly known as spruce smilax, is a flowering plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some wildlife. Smilax spruceana thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems and a subject of interest in horticulture and ecological studies."
