    "intro": "Senecio angulifolius var. ingens, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, deeply lobed leaves that are often angular in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
