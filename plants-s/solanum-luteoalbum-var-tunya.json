It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its yellow and white flowers, which are typically small and clustered in inflorescences. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, round berries that change color as they mature. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
