    "intro": "Salix occidentalisinensis, commonly known as the western silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and finely textured, silvery-gray leaves that shimmer in the wind. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid regions."
