    "intro": "Stenoptera ciliaris, commonly known as the silver fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that give it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Stenoptera ciliaris is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
