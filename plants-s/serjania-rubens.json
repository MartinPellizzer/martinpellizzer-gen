    "intro": "Serjania rubens, commonly known as the red serjania, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal. Serjania rubens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
