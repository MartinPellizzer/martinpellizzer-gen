    "intro": "Sterculia morobeensis, commonly known as the Morobe nut tree, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces a heavy, woody fruit that contains a single large, edible seed surrounded by a fibrous husk. It is valued for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein and oil, and for its potential use in reforestation efforts due to its hardy nature. The species also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife."
