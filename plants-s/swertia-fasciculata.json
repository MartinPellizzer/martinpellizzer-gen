    "intro": "Swertia fasciculata, commonly known as the golden thread, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Swertia fasciculata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
