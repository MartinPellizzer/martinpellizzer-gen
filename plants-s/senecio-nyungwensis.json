    "intro": "Senecio nyungwensis, commonly known as the Nyungwa senecio, is a flowering plant native to the montane forests of the Nyungwa Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and alternate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming a composite inflorescence that attracts various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
