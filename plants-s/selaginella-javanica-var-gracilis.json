    "intro": "Selaginella javanica var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper stems and are distinctive in appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
