    "intro": "Succisa decurrens, commonly known as the trailing arfvedsonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a succulent texture that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
