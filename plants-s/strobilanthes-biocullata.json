    "intro": "Strobilanthes biocullata, commonly known as the golden flame or flame of the forest, is a striking flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red inflorescences that bloom in late summer, creating a spectacular visual display. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its rapid growth cycle, which allows it to flower and set seed within a short period. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Strobilanthes biocullata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
