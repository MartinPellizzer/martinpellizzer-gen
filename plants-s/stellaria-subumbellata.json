    "intro": "Stellaria subumbellata, commonly known as the starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters that resemble a star, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Stellaria subumbellata is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its runners."
