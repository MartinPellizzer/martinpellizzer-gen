    "intro": "Sequoia gigantea, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is one of the largest and oldest living organisms on Earth, with some specimens reaching heights of over 300 feet. The tree has thick, fibrous bark that provides natural protection against fire and insect damage. Its cones produce small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The leaves are needle-like and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in a variety of forest conditions."
