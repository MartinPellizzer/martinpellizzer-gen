    "intro": "Serratula tinctoria subsp. macrocephala, commonly known as the giant yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
