It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional Indian medicine for its purported calming and antispasmodic effects."
