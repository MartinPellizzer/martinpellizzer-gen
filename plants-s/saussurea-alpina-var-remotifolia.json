    "intro": "Saussurea alpina var. remotifolia, commonly known as the Alpine safflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust, fibrous root system and a tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces numerous yellow to orange composite flowers arranged in a single, showy inflorescence at the top of the stem. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. This variant is adapted to high-altitude environments, with a preference for well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure."
