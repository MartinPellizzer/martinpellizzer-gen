    "intro": "Senecio villiferus, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Senecio villiferus is typically found in rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
