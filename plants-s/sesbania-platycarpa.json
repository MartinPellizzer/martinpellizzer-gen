    "intro": "Sesbania platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-seeded sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain numerous flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Sesbania platycarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
