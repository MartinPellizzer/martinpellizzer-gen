    "intro": "Sarcathria radicans, commonly known as the creeping root vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Sarcathria radicans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
