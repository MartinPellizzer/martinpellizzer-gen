    "intro": "Stevia uniaristata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant is renowned for its intensely sweet leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as alternatives to sugar. Stevia uniaristata typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, attracting various pollinators."
