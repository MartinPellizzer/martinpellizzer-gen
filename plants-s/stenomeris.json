    "intro": "Stenomeris, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Stenomeris species are typically small shrubs or herbs with narrow, linear leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. They often have a compact growth habit and are adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. The genus is characterized by its distinctive floral structure and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
