    "intro": "Sagittaria alpina var. submersa, commonly known as the submerged arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often submerged, with arrowhead-shaped foliage that helps in identifying the species. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing above the water surface in late summer. This variant is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that aid in buoyancy and nutrient absorption."
