    "intro": "Schnella umbriana, commonly known as the Umbrian speedwell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Italy. It belongs to the family Stellariaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Schnella umbriana is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
