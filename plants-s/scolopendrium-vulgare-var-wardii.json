    "intro": "Scolopendrium vulgare var. wardii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a variety of the common holly fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance in garden settings."
