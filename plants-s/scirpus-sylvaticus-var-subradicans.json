    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. subradicans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrower than those of the typical Scirpus sylvaticus. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences that are often reddish in color. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
