    "intro": "Salpichlaena patersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense mat of foliage, which helps in soil stabilization. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
