    "intro": "Sedum acre subsp. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions."
