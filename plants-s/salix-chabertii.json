    "intro": "Salix chabertii, commonly known as Chabert's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and features slender, drooping branches with smooth, gray bark. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a silvery-green underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in woodland edges."
