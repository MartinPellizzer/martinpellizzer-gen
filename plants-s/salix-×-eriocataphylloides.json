    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 eriocataphylloides, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
