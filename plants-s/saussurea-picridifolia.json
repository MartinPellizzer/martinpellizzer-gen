    "intro": "Saussurea picridifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
