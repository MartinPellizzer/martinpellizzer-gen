    "intro": "Sida palmata, commonly known as the palmate sida, is a flowering plant native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sida palmata is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
