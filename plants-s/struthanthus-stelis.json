    "intro": "Struthanthus stelis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble small, ghostly faces, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Struthanthus stelis is a member of the Loasaceae family and is known for its striking, ephemeral floral display."
