    "intro": "Sparattosperma lithontripticum var. subtometosum, commonly known as the stonebreaker spathes, is a rare tropical plant characterized by its thick, fibrous roots and waxy, strap-like leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to withstand drought and nutrient-poor conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
