    "intro": "Solanum bagamojense, commonly known as the Bagamoyo nightshade, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, particularly Tanzania. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom at night. Its berries, which are toxic, are often mistaken for edible fruits due to their appearance. Solanum bagamojense plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
