    "intro": "Sagittaria ornithorhyncha, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Sagittaria ornithorhyncha plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
