    "intro": "Schizachyrium oligostachyum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and woodland environments. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and distinctive silver-white panicles that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and often serves as a key component of native grassland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, providing habitat and erosion control. Schizachyrium oligostachyum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in restoration projects."
