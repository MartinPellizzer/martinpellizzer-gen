    "intro": "Stevia totorensis, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and northern Argentina. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Stevia totorensis is valued for its intense sweetness and is used in herbal remedies and as a sugar substitute."
