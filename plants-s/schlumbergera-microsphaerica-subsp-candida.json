It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are segmented and often branched. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the winter months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
