    "intro": "Sarcostemma variifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaved milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to regions of southern and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along forest edges. The species is noted for its milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the family Asclepiadaceae."
