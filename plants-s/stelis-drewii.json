    "intro": "Stelis drewii, commonly known as the Drew's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis drewii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of tropical forests."
