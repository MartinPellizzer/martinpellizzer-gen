    "intro": "Schizaea attenuata, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, upright stem and whorled leaves that are linear and often reddish in color. Schizaea attenuata reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
