    "intro": "Sanvitalia fruticosa, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with gray-green, fuzzy foliage that becomes more pronounced in full sun. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
