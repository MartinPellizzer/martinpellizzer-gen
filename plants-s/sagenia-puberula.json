    "intro": "Sagenia puberula, commonly known as the hairy sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sagenia puberula is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
