    "intro": "Solanum tabacifolium, commonly known as the tobacco-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other familiar plants such as tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble tobacco leaves, hence its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum tabacifolium is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
