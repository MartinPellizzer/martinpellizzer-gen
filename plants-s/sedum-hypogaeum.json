    "intro": "Sedum hypogaeum, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Sedum hypogaeum is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ability to spread easily."
