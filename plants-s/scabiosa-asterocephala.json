    "intro": "Scabiosa asterocephala, commonly known as the starhead scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pink or white flowers that resemble a star, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds by wind. Scabiosa asterocephala is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
