    "intro": "Salix amygdalina var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The plant produces catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it blooms in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark is smooth and greyish, and the plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
