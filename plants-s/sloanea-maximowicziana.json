It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
