    "intro": "Satyrium oliganthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a single, erect spike bearing several pale green or white flowers, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. The species is adapted to high humidity and shade, making it a common component of understory vegetation in its native habitat."
