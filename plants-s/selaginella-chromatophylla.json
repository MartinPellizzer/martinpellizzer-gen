    "intro": "Selaginella chromatophylla, commonly known as the red-stemmed spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella chromatophylla is also noted for its ability to survive in low-light conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
