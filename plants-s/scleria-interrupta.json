    "intro": "Scleria interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with linear, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Scleria interrupta is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
