    "intro": "Sweetia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sweetia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in consistently moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sweetia uliginosa plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
