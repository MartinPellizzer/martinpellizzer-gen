    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that typically range from 30 to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, triquetrous (three-angled) spikelets arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence, which are often greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This variety is often found in marshes, fens, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
