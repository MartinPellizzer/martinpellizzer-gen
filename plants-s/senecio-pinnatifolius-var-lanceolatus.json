It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
