    "intro": "Santalum preissianum, commonly known as the Queensland sandalwood, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia, it typically grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color. Its wood is highly valued for its fragrance and is used in the production of incense and essential oils."
