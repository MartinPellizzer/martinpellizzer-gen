    "intro": "Salix ketoiensis, commonly known as the Korean willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and forest edges. Salix ketoiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
