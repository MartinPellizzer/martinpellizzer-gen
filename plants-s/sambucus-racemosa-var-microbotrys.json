    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. microbotrys, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces dark red berries in the fall, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and the stems are typically reddish and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
