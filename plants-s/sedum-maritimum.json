    "intro": "Sedum maritimum, commonly known as sea sedum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in salty, sandy environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit enables it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize coastal soils. Sedum maritimum is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
