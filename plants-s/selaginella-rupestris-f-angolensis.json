The plant exhibits a unique life cycle with a dominant sporophyte generation and a short, dependent gametophyte phase. Its structure includes a stem with whorled leaves and specialized structures for spore production. This fern ally is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
