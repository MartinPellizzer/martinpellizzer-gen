    "intro": "Scaphosepalum panamense, commonly known as the Panama ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology includes long, slender sepals and petals that are often curved or twisted. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Scaphosepalum panamense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
