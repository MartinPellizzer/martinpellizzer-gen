    "intro": "Sporobolus vaginiflorus, commonly known as the bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of bright red or yellow flowers that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, three-angled stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green coloration. Sporobolus vaginiflorus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry climates."
