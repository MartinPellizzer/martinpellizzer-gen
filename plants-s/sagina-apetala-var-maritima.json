    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. maritima, commonly known as sea saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white flowers. It is often found in maritime environments, such as dunes and rocky shores. Its hardy nature makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
