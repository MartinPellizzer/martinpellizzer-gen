    "intro": "Solidago elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, alternate along the stem, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. Solidago elliptica plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late season."
