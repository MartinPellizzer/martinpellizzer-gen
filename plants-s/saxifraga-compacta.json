    "intro": "Saxifraga compacta, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, reducing water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga compacta is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, making it a common sight in mountainous and tundra environments."
