It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or on rocky shores. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to specific ecological conditions, making it an important component of coastal flora."
