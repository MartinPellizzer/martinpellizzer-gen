    "intro": "Sedum parvisepalum, commonly known as the small-sepal sedum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss."
