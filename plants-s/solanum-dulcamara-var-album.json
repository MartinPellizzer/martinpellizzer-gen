    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. album, commonly known as white bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed, characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is a perennial vine belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces berries that range from green to yellow or red when mature. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
