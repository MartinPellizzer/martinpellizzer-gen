    "intro": "Salix koreensis var. brevistyla, commonly known as the Korean weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Korea. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
