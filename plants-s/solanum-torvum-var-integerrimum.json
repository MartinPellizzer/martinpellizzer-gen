    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. integerrimum, commonly known as the greater yellow nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to berries that mature to a striking red or orange color. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains various alkaloids, some of which have medicinal or toxic properties. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
