    "intro": "Salix torfacea, commonly known as the Torface willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family."
