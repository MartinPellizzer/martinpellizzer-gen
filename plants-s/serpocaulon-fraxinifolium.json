    "intro": "Serpocaulon fraxinifolium, commonly known as the maple-leaved serpocaulon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has opposite, simple, and serrated leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in loose clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. The plant is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in rich, moist soils."
