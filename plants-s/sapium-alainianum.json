    "intro": "Sapium alainianum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy fruiting structures. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
