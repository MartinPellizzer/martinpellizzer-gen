    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon angulosum f. laciniatum, commonly known as the jagged stigmaphyllon, is a unique bromeliad species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often jagged leaf blades that can reach several meters in length. The plant forms a rosette structure, with the leaves curving inward to create a central water-holding cavity, typical of bromeliads. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance and aiding in water retention. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
