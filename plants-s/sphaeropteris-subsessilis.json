    "intro": "Sphaeropteris subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and leathery. The plant produces large, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
