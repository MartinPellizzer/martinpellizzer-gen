    "intro": "Steffensia tiliifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf tiliifolia, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along waterways, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing pale yellow to greenish blooms that appear in late spring. Steffensia tiliifolia plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
