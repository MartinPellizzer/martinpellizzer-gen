    "intro": "Seticereus aurivillus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for desert survival. The plant's ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to thrive in low rainfall conditions."
