    "intro": "Smilax aspera var. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania prickly nightshade, is a perennial vine native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp spines and its dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Due to its spiny structure and medicinal properties, it is both a defensive plant and a traditional remedy in some regions."
