    "intro": "Solanum uliginosum, commonly known as the swamp nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by violet or purple berries that contain toxic seeds. Solanum uliginosum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares some chemical similarities with other toxic members of the genus. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
