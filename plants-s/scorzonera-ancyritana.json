    "intro": "Scorzonera ancyritana, commonly known as the alpine scorzonera, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or divided. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, rounded shape, and its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. Scorzonera ancyritana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
