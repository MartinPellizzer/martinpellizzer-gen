    "intro": "Sideroxylon calcareum, commonly known as the limestone wood or rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sideroxylon calcareum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature in xerophytic landscapes."
