    "intro": "Sterculia, commonly known as the \"Australian chestnut,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It includes several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants typically have broad, palmately lobed leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or red. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, often accompanied by a fleshy, edible aril. Sterculia species are valued for their ornamental beauty and have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
