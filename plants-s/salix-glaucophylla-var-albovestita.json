    "intro": "Salix glaucophylla var. albovestita, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a variant of the glaucophylla willow species. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, temperate regions, often near water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
