    "intro": "Salix erecta, commonly known as the upright willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by the wind. Its roots are fibrous and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to rocky or arid environments. Salix erecta is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful appearance and hardy nature."
