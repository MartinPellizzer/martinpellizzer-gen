    "intro": "Salix glauca var. incana, commonly known as the silky willow, is a variant of the silky dogwood, characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray bark and finely hairy leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, downy texture that distinguishes it from other willow species. This plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various insects and birds."
