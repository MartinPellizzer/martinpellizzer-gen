    "intro": "Syngonium donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Emerald Gem, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a climbing plant characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a striking white or cream-colored margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Syngonium donnell-smithii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
