    "intro": "Stachys, commonly known as betony or dead-nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their square stems, opposite leaves, and whorled or clustered inflorescences. Many species produce small, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. They are often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Stachys species are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
