    "intro": "Suttonia meziana, commonly known as the Mezian lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens in cooler climates. Suttonia meziana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
