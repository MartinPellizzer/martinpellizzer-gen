    "intro": "Sisymbrium litorale var. virgatum, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its growth habit is prostrate or ascending, with stems that often root at the nodes. The fruits are small, pod-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its spread along coastal habitats."
