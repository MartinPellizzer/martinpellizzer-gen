    "intro": "Soridium, commonly known as the false lichen, is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. These organisms are composite life forms consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Soridium species are often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. They play an important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in their ecosystems. The thallus of Soridium is usually crustose or foliose, with a distinctive coloration that can range from pale yellow to dark brown."
