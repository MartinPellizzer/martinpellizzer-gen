    "intro": "Stipa verruculosa, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa verruculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
