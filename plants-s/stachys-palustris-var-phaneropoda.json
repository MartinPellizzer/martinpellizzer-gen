It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used by Indigenous peoples for various healing purposes."
