    "intro": "Solidago alata, commonly known as the winged goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are covered with fine, hairy ridges, giving it a distinctive \"winged\" appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture. Solidago alata thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
