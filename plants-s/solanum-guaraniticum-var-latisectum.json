    "intro": "Solanum guaraniticum var. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leafed nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad, ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
