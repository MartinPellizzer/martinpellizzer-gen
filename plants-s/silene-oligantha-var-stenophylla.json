    "intro": "Silene oligantha var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene oligantha var. stenophylla is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
