    "intro": "Struthanthus, commonly known as the desert star, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Struthanthus species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. They play an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
