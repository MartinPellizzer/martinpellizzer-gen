    "intro": "Scirpus caricinus, commonly known as the greater bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves and dense, cylindrical clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread and form dense stands that stabilize shoreline soils. Scirpus caricinus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
