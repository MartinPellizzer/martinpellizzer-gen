    "intro": "Spermacoce crispata, commonly known as the hairy false sandwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, a common dispersal method in the Rubiaceae family. Spermacoce crispata is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
