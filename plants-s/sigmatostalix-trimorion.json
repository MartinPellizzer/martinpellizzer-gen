    "intro": "Sigmatostalix trimorion, commonly known as the three-lobed ironwood, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and distinctive trifoliate leaves that split into three lobes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, bean-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
