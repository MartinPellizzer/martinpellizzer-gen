It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically compound, with a feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions with proper care. However, it requires consistent moisture and indirect light to flourish."
