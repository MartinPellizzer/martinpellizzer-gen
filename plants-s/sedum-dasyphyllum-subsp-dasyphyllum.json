    "intro": "Sedum dasyphyllum subsp. dasyphyllum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
