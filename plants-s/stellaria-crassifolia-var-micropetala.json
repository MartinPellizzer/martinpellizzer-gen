    "intro": "Stellaria crassifolia var. micropetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy surface and a narrow, sometimes succulent appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a low profile to avoid harsh weather conditions."
