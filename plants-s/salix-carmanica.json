    "intro": "Salix carmanica, commonly known as the Carmarthenshire willow, is a small shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
