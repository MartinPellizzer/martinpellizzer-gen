    "intro": "Santaloides gossweileri, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves and its ability to derive nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces tiny, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat preferences, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
