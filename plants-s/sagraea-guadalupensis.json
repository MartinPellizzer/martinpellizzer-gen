    "intro": "Sagraea guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupensis sagraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the arid environment it inhabits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
