    "intro": "Stipa purpurea var. arenosa, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of pinkish to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as steppes, dunes, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
