    "intro": "Sambucus latipinna var. coreana, commonly known as the Korean elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with 5 to 7 oval, serrated leaflets that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain seeds that are toxic if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening."
