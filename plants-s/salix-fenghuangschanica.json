    "intro": "Salix fenghuangschanica, commonly known as the Huangshanshan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and blooms in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
