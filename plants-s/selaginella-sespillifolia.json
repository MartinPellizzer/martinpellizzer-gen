    "intro": "Selaginella sespillifolia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of spikemoss native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen, feathery fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant has a unique life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern and contain small, scale-like structures called strobila. Selaginella sespillifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices."
