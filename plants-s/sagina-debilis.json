    "intro": "Sagina debilis, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils. The plant is often found in coastal areas, meadows, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
