    "intro": "Schizocodon ilicifolius, commonly known as the fragrant wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctive red or purple stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue to black berries. Its leaves emit a strong, minty scent when crushed, which is due to the presence of aromatic compounds. Schizocodon ilicifolius thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and wetlands."
