    "intro": "Selaginella bomiensis, commonly known as the Bomi sprout moss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, fern-like leaves and a short, upright stem. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
