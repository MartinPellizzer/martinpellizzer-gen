It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually glandular-pubescent. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
