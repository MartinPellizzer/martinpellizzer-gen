    "intro": "Sorbus parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Sorbus parviflora is often found in rocky or woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
