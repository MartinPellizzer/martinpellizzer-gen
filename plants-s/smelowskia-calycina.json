    "intro": "Smelowskia calycina, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Smelowskia calycina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
