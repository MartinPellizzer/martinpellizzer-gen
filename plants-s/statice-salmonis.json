    "intro": "Statice salmonis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Mediterranean basin. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically bluish-green, and it is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. Statice salmonis is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
