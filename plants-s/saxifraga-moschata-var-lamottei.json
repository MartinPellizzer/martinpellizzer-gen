It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that are typically rosette-shaped. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
