    "intro": "Sporobolus transvaalensis, commonly known as Transvaal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in drought-prone regions. Sporobolus transvaalensis is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
