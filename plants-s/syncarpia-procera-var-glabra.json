    "intro": "Syncarpia procera var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved silky oak, is a variant of the silky oak tree native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous (hairless) leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal and lowland areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy, fast-growing nature."
