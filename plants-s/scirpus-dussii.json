    "intro": "Scirpus dussii, commonly known as the Duss's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Scirpus dussii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
