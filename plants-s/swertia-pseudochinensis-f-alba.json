    "intro": "Swertia pseudochinensis f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered swertia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are often branched and hairy. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is a sought-after species among botanical enthusiasts and conservationists."
