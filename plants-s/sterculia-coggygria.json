    "intro": "Sterculia coggygria, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a smooth, dark bark and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is valued for its hard, durable wood. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also used in traditional medicine."
