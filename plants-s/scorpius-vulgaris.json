    "intro": "Scorpius vulgaris, commonly known as the common scorpion plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features showy, red-orange flowers with a distinctive, spiky structure that resembles a scorpion, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Scorpius vulgaris is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
