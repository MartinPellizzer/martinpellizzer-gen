It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and flat, often floating on the water surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for aquatic wildlife."
