It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
