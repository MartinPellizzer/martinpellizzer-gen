It is a shrub characterized by its small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces fruit that turns from green to red as it matures. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. The plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
