    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 furcata, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, often pink or white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Saxifraga \u00d7 furcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy garden plant."
