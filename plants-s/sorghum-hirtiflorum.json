    "intro": "Sorghum hirtiflorum, commonly known as the woollyflower sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and dense, woolly inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically green to purple in color. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Sorghum hirtiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
