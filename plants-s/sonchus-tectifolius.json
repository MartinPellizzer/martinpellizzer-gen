    "intro": "Sonchus tectifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It often grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a weed and a plant of interest in ecological studies."
