    "intro": "Sesamum indicum subsp. malabaricum, commonly known as Malabar sesame, is a cultivated variant of the sesame plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more elongated seed capsules compared to the typical sesame species. The plant produces dark brown, oval-shaped seeds that are rich in oil and protein, making them valuable for culinary and industrial uses. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is also of interest in botanical research for its potential in crop diversification and adaptation to changing environmental conditions."
