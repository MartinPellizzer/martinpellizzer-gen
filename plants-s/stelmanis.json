    "intro": "Stelmanis, commonly known as the golden star or yellow star grass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stelmanis is often found in moist, open habitats like meadows and wetlands. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and erosion control."
