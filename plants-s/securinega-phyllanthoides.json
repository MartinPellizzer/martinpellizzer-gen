    "intro": "Securinega phyllanthoides, commonly known as the African spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain areas."
