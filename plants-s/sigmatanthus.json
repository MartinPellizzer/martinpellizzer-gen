    "intro": "Sigmatanthus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. Sigmatanthus species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with woody stems and small, alternate leaves. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
