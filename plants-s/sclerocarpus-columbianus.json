    "intro": "Sclerocarpus columbianus, commonly known as the Colombian screwbean, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed, a feature typical of the genus Sclerocarpus. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
