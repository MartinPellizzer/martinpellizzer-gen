It is characterized by its silvery-white, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. Searsia gracillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
