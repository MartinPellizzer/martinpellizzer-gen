    "intro": "Salix stylaris var. multifolia, commonly known as the multi-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely toothed, lanceolate leaves that are often arranged in a multi-leaved pattern, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
