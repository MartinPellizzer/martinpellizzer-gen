It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred petals that resemble a trigger mechanism. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually red or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Stylidium edentatum is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds due to its striking appearance and nectar-rich flowers."
