    "intro": "Strobilanthes mediocris, commonly known as the lesser flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Strobilanthes mediocris is also notable for its seasonal blooming pattern, which occurs during the rainy season."
