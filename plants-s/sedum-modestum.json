It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, linear to ovate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum modestum is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
