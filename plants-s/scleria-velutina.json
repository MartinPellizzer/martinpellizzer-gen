    "intro": "Scleria velutina, commonly known as the velvet sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a soft, velvety texture, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. Scleria velutina is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats."
