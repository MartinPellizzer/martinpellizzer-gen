    "intro": "Swartzia pernitida, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its dense, dark wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
