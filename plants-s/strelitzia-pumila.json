    "intro": "Strelitzia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bird-of-paradise, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces unique, colorful inflorescences resembling a bird's beak, typically in shades of orange and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its small size, it is an ideal choice for container gardening or small garden spaces."
