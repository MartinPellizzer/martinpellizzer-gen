    "intro": "Simocheilus purpureus, commonly known as the purple water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or red, especially along the veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils. Simocheilus purpureus plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
