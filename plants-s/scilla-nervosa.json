    "intro": "Scilla nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and early blooming habit. Scilla nervosa is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
