    "intro": "Stelis carpinterae, commonly known as the Carpintera orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often in late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid forest floor. Stelis carpinterae thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in understory habitats of tropical rainforests."
