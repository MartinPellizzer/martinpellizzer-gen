    "intro": "Selaginella rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Rajasthani spikemoss, is a rare and endemic vascular plant found primarily in the arid regions of Rajasthan, India. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, exhibiting features such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
