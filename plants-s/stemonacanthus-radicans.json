    "intro": "Stemonacanthus radicans, commonly known as the climbing fig or creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions. Stemonacanthus radicans is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
