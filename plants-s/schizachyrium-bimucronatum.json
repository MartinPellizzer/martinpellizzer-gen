It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that are often reddish in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
