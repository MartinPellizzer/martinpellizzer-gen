It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways or in wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
