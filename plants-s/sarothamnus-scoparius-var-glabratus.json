It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, needle-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
