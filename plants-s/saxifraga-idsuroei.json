    "intro": "Saxifraga idsuroei, commonly known as the Tibetan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, often white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saxifraga idsuroei is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates and its role in alpine ecosystems."
