    "intro": "Salix grisea, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a slightly rough texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows."
