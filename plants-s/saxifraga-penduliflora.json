    "intro": "Saxifraga penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Saxifraga penduliflora is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
