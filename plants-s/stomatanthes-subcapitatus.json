    "intro": "Stomatanthes subcapitatus, commonly known as the narrow-headed veldtgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological adaptability."
