    "intro": "Salix tristis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a silvery underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse via wind. This species is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
