    "intro": "Salix reticulata subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the snow willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that grow close to the ground, adapting to harsh, cold environments. The leaves are small, elliptic, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against frost. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants, typical of the Salicaceae family. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
