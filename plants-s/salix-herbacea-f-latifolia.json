    "intro": "Salix herbacea f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and long, slender leaves that are broader than the typical form of Salix herbacea. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it often thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is frequently found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
