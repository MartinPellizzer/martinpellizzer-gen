    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 penicellatum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a hybrid succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Sempervivum \u00d7 penicellatum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
