    "intro": "Samaipaticereus, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking cactus native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the spring. Samaipaticereus thrives in cool, arid environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular specimen plant among cactus enthusiasts."
