    "intro": "Siderasis medusoides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, umbrella-like blooms that resemble jellyfish, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, white to pale blue flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance at night. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it adapted to harsh desert conditions. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
