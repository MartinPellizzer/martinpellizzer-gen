    "intro": "Symphonia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved symphonia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often found in lowland tropical rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
