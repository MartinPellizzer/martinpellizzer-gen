    "intro": "Striga forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a slender, branched stem. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like maize and sorghum. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the roots of host plants through haustoria."
