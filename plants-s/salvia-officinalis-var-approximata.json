    "intro": "Salvia officinalis var. approximata, commonly known as narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are slightly narrower than those of the common sage. The plant produces upright spikes of violet or purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of common sage, with uses in traditional herbal remedies."
