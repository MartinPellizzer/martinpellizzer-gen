    "intro": "Solidago scopulorum, commonly known as the rock goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as cliffs, ledges, and open woodlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flower clusters in the late summer and early fall. Its flowering period makes it a valuable pollinator resource for bees and other insects. Solidago scopulorum is also recognized for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
