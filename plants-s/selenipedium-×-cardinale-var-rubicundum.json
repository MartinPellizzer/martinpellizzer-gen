    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 cardinale var. rubicundum, commonly known as the red-stemmed selenipedium, is a hybrid orchid native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often displaying a distinctive reddish hue. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with numerous pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging and valuable species for orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
