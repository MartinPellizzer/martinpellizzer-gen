    "intro": "Strophanthus caudatus f. marckii, commonly known as the red-flowered strophanthus, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from red to orange in color. The plant produces toxic cardiac glycosides, which have historically been used in medicine but require careful handling. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it is often grown in controlled environments due to its toxicity."
