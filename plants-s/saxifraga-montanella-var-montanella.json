    "intro": "Saxifraga montanella var. montanella, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention and protection from harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
