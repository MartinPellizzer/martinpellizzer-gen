    "intro": "Saxifraga carpetana var. eucarpetana, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is closely related to other saxifrage species and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
