    "intro": "Saurauia caquetensis var. caquetensis, commonly known as the Caquet\u00e9 Saurauia, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
