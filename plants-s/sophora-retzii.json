    "intro": "Sophora retzii, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, pendulous clusters of blue to purple flowers in the spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively. Sophora retzii is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
