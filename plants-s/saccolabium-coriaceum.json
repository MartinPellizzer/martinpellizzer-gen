    "intro": "Saccolabium coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf saccolabium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Saccolabium coriaceum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in some regions."
