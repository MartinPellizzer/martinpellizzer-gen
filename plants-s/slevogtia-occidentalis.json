    "intro": "Slevogtia occidentalis, commonly known as the western slevogtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, coastal habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slight pubescence that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
