    "intro": "Stellilabium jostii, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped labellum, which gives it its common name and sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually a vibrant mix of purple and yellow, and it blooms during the warmer months. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Stellilabium jostii is considered a vulnerable species."
