    "intro": "Syzygium magnoliifolium, commonly known as the magnolia-leaf clove, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of north-eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that resemble those of magnolia trees, hence its common name. It produces fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, aromatic fruits. Syzygium magnoliifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its essential oils used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
