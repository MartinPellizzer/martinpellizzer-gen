    "intro": "Senegalia riparioides, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its twisted, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that appear in clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Senegalia riparioides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
