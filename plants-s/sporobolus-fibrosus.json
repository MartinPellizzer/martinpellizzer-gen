    "intro": "Sporobolus fibrosus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, fibrous stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. Sporobolus fibrosus is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
