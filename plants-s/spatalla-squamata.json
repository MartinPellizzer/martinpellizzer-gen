    "intro": "Spatalla squamata, commonly known as the squamata lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greyish to brown in color and covered with a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. Spatalla squamata is known for its slow growth and is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality."
