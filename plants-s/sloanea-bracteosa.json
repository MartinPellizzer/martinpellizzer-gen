    "intro": "Sloanea bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Sloanea bracteosa is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
