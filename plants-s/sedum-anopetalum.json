    "intro": "Sedum anopetalum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid environments."
