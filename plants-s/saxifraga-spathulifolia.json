    "intro": "Saxifraga spathulifolia, commonly known as the spoon-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad, spoon-shaped, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga spathulifolia is a hardy species that is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
