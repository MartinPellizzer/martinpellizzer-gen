    "intro": "Scaphium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered spathiphyllum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf known as a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Scaphium parviflorum is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
