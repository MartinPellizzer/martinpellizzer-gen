    "intro": "Staphylea corymbosa, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are harvested in the autumn. Staphylea corymbosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
