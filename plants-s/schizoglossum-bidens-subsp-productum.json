    "intro": "Schizoglossum bidens subsp. productum, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
