    "intro": "Saxifraga wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saxifraga wallichiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
