It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Serratula amara typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months."
