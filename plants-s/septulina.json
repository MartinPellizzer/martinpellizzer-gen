    "intro": "Septulina, commonly known as the false indigo or Indian mallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These plants are characterized by their showy, often blue or purple flowers and palmately lobed leaves. Septulina species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some having medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
