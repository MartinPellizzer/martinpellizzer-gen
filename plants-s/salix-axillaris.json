    "intro": "Salix axillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. Salix axillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
