    "intro": "Spathiphyllum floribundum, commonly known as the peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the understory of humid forests in Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum floribundum is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
