    "intro": "Sedum telephium subsp. ruprechtii, commonly known as the Ruprecht's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
