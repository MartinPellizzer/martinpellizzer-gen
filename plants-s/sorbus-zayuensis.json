    "intro": "Sorbus zayuensis, commonly known as the Yunnan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive berries that are orange-red when mature. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high elevations in forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
