    "intro": "Sarcomphalus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinct, darkly pigmented, and often spotted thallus, which gives it its common name. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality."
