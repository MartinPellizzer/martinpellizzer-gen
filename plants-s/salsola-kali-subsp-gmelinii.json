    "intro": "Salsola kali subsp. gmelinii, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils. This species is often invasive in non-native regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
