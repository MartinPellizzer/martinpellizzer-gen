    "intro": "Stahlianthus, commonly known as the Hawaiian flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by vibrant, papery bracts. Stahlianthus species are often found in coastal and lowland habitats, thriving in the unique climate of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, many species within this genus are now considered endangered."
