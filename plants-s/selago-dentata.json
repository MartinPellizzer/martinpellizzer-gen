    "intro": "Selago dentata, commonly known as the toothed selago, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas. Its leaves are narrowly lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Selago dentata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
