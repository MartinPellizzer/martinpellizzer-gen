    "intro": "Schidospermum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, including Schidospermum lobatum and Schidospermum tamarindoides. The plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. They typically have smooth, grayish bark and produce small, clustered flowers. Schidospermum species are often found in woodland and savanna habitats, growing as shrubs or small trees."
