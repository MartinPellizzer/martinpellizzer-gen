    "intro": "Skeptrostachys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the undergrowth. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Skeptrostachys is considered endangered in many regions."
