    "intro": "Stipa amphicarpa, commonly known as the two-seeded needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two types of florets, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Stipa amphicarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
