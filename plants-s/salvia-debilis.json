    "intro": "Salvia debilis, commonly known as the slender sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spikes of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid climates for its beauty and low maintenance requirements."
