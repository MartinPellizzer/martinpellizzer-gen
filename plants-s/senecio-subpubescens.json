It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
