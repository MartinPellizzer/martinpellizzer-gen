    "intro": "Solanum pseudocapsicum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Central and South America. It features small, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant bears yellowish-orange berries that are typically toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
