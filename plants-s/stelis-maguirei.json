    "intro": "Stelis maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with small, clustered pseudobulbs and narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or striped. Stelis maguirei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
