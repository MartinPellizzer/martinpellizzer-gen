    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis subsp. krahnii, commonly known as the Tiraqu\u00e9nensis Subspecies, is a rare and unique cactus native to the arid regions of Chile. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant features short, ribbed stems and produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and high sunlight exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
