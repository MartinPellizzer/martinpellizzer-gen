    "intro": "Sporobolus familiaris, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, drought-tolerant perennial grass native to the United States and Mexico. It has fine, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of native grasslands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Buffalo grass is often used in landscaping due to its minimal water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils."
