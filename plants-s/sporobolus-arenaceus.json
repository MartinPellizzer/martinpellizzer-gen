    "intro": "Sporobolus arenaceus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, pale green or blue-gray flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Sporobolus arenaceus is adapted to drought conditions and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing sandy soils."
