    "intro": "Solanum darienense, commonly known as Darien nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often mistaken for edible fruits, making it important to identify correctly. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
