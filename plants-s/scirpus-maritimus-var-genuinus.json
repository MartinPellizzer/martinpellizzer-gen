    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. genuinus, commonly known as the coastal bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in saline or brackish environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize shorelines and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus maritimus var. genuinus is an important species for coastal ecosystem restoration and erosion control."
