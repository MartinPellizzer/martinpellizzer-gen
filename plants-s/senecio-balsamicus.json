    "intro": "Senecio balsamicus, commonly known as the Balsam weed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a sprawling growth habit with hairy leaves and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of the United States."
