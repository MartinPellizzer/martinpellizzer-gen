    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste fulvescens, commonly known as the golden-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
