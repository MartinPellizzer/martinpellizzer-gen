It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often spiny stems. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. Stapelia umbonata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
