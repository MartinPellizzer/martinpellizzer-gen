It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a syringe, hence its scientific name. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
