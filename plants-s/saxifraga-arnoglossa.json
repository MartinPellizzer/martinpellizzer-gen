    "intro": "Saxifraga arnoglossa, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
