It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. It is often found in woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
