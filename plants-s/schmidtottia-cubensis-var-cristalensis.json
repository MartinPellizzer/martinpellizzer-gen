It belongs to the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a crystal structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or limestone-rich areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
