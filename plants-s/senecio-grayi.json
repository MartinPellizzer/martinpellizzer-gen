    "intro": "Senecio grayi, commonly known as Gray's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Senecio grayi is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
