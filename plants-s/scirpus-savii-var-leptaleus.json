    "intro": "Scirpus savii var. leptaleus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters in shallow water or moist soil. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are often pale green or brownish in color. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
