    "intro": "Saxifraga debilis, commonly known as the weak saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems that are often covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga debilis is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
