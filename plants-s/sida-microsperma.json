    "intro": "Sida microsperma, commonly known as small-seeded Sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences. Sida microsperma produces small, dry fruits called capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
