    "intro": "Schoberia baccifera, commonly known as the red-rooted spurge, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a stout, reddish root system and upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Schoberia baccifera is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
