    "intro": "Sagraea trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats within tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
