    "intro": "Salix ustnerensis, commonly known as the Ustner's willow, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andes of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests and mountainous regions. The plant has slender, often pendulous branches and produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a silvery underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix ustnerensis is considered a botanical curiosity and of potential ecological importance in its native range."
