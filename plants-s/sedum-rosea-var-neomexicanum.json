It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers during the summer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in USDA hardiness zones 6 to 9."
