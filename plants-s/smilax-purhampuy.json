It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest understories. Smilax purhampuy is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and distinctive appearance."
