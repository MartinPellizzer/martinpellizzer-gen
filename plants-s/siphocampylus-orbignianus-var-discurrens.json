It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five petals, and are usually pale blue or violet in color. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
