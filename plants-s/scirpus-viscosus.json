    "intro": "Scirpus viscosus, commonly known as sticky bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers that mature into brown, spiky seed heads. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with a sticky substance, which helps in seed dispersal. Scirpus viscosus thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common species in marshes and pond edges."
