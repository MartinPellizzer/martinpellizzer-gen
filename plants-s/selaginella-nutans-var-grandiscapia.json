    "intro": "Selaginella nutans var. grandiscapia, commonly known as the drooping spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its wiry, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, that contain both microspores and megaspores for sexual reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
