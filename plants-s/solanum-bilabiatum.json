It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically at the ends of branches. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer. Solanum bilabiatum is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments."
