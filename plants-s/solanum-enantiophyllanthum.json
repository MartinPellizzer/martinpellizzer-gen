    "intro": "Solanum enantiophyllanthum, commonly known as the enantiophyllanthum nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, often bi-colored flowers that display a unique symmetry, with petals that appear mirror-image on either side of the flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that changes color as it matures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations across parts of Southeast Asia."
