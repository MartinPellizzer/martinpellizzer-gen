    "intro": "Sechium talamancensis, commonly known as the Talamancan chayote, is a tropical vine native to Central America. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash. The plant produces large, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to the common chayote but have a more elongated shape. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and climbing. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow or orange, indicating maturity."
