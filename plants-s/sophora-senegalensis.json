    "intro": "Sophora senegalensis, commonly known as the African locusttree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to western Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in agroforestry practices. The tree is also valued for its hardwood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
