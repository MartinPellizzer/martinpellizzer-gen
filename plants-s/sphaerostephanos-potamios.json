    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos potamios, commonly known as the river starflower, is a rare and critically endangered plant native to the island of Cyprus. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. The plant grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its small, fleshy leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to extinction."
