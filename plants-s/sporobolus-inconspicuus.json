    "intro": "Sporobolus inconspicuus, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control. Its ecological importance is further enhanced by its role in supporting wildlife and livestock."
