    "intro": "Stachys mollissima, commonly known as velvet plant or woolly betony, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, soft, and fuzzy foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces spikes of pale purple to blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Stachys mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
