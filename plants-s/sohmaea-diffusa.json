    "intro": "Sohmaea diffusa, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows from rhizomes and has broad, strap-like leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, stout stem. Sohmaea diffusa is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays an important ecological role."
