    "intro": "Spiranthes tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It blooms from late summer to early fall, producing a delicate, fragrant floral display. Spiranthes tenella is a low-maintenance plant that plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
