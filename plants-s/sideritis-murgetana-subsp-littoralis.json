    "intro": "Sideritis murgetana subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sideritis, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, hairy leaves that are adapted to coastal and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain parts of southern Europe."
