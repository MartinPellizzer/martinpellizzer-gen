    "intro": "Sutera marifolia, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and produce nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sutera marifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
