    "intro": "Salix sachalinensis f. aequitriens, commonly known as the flat-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the northeastern regions of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
