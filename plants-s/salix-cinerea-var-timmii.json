    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. timmii, commonly known as the Timm's grey willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-barked stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
