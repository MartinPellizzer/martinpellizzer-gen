    "intro": "Sium hispidum, commonly known as hogweed, is a member of theApiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. The plant is known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is toxic if ingested. Sium hispidum is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges."
