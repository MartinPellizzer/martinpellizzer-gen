    "intro": "Stipa brachychaeta f. major, commonly known as the giant feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. The inflorescence is a panicle, composed of multiple spikelets that are loosely arranged and contribute to its ornamental value."
