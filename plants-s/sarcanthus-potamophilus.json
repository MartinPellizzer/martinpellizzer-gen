    "intro": "Sarcanthus potamophilus, commonly known as the riverbank mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southern Africa. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its slender stems. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in riparian zones. Sarcanthus potamophilus is adapted to moist environments and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
