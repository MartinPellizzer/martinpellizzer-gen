    "intro": "Sphondylium villosum, commonly known as the hairy false sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a central yellow disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Sphondylium villosum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
