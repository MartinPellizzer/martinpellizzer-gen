    "intro": "Salix cordata var. mackenzieana, commonly known as Mackenzie's willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. Due to its cold tolerance and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
