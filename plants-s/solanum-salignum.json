    "intro": "Solanum salignum, commonly known as the coastal nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and drought. Solanum salignum is often found in rocky soils along coastal cliffs and dunes."
