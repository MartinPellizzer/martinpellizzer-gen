    "intro": "Stenogyne rotundifolia var. oblonga, commonly known as the oblongleaf stenogyne, is a species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
