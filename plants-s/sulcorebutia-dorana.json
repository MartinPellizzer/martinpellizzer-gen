    "intro": "Sulcorebutia dorana, commonly known as the Doran's stone cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Sulcorebutia dorana is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
