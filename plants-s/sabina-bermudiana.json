    "intro": "Sabina bermudiana, commonly known as the Bermuda cypress, is a small evergreen conifer native to the subtropical regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and a conical shape, which helps it withstand strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and protected species."
