    "intro": "Salix sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic willow, is a shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often boggy environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Salix sudetica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
