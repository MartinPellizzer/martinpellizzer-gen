    "intro": "Salsola cruciata, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a common species in desert and coastal areas. Salsola cruciata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
