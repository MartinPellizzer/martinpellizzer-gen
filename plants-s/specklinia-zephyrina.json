    "intro": "Specklinia zephyrina, commonly known as the wind fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
