    "intro": "Spergula salina var. longicaulis, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas. It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, making it ecologically important in salt marsh ecosystems. It is often found in regions with fluctuating water levels and is adapted to withstand both flooding and drought."
