    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. pulu-wayk'u, commonly known as the Andean tomato, is a unique botanical variant native to the highlands of the Andes. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that resemble cherry tomatoes. The plant typically grows in cool, temperate climates and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers that develop into the edible fruits. This variety is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its cultural significance among Andean communities."
