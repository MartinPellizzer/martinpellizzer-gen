    "intro": "Stadiochilus, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their epiphytic growth habit, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Stadiochilus species typically have long, narrow leaves and produce showy, fragrant flowers that are often brightly colored. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated for horticultural purposes."
