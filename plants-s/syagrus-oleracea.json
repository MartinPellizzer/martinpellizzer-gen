It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small yellow flowers that develop into red, edible fruits containing black seeds. Syagrus oleracea is often found in wetlands and floodplains, thriving in humid, tropical climates. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its ornamental and economic uses."
