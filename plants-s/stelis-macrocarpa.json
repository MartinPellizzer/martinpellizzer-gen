    "intro": "Stelis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant features long, slender leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Stelis macrocarpa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Its botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the ecological diversity of tropical forests."
