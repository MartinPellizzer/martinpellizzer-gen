    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 cinerea, commonly known as the grey willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, thriving in wetland environments. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix \u00d7 cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks through its extensive root system."
