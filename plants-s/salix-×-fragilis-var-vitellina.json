It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows along stream banks and moist soils. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollinators. This plant is valued for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize riverbanks while providing habitat for wildlife."
