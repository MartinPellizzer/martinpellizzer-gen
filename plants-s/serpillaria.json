    "intro": "Serpillaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, leafless structure and its ability to grow on trees or rocks, making it an epiphyte. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale green, with a delicate, almost spectral appearance. Serpillaria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, primarily in Southeast Asia and Australia. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
