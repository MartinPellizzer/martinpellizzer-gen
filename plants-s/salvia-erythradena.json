    "intro": "Salvia erythradena, commonly known as scarlet salvia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia erythradena is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
