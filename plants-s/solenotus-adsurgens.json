    "intro": "Solenotus adsurgens, commonly known as the climbing solenotus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb other vegetation. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Solenotus adsurgens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
