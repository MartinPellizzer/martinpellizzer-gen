    "intro": "Savia ranavalonae, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Savia ranavalonae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in Madagascar's unique ecosystems."
