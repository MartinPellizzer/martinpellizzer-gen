    "intro": "Syringodea ignescens, commonly known as the fiery flame plant, is a striking member of the Melanthiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. Syringodea ignescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments."
