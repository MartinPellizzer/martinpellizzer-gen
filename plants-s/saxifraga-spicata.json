    "intro": "Saxifraga spicata, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Saxifraga spicata plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provides nectar for pollinators."
