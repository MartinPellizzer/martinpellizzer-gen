It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features hairy, branching stems and produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with pubescent surfaces, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to dry conditions. Sida aristata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
