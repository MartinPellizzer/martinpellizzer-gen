    "intro": "Senecio nebrodensis var. aurasiacus, commonly known as the Aurasiacus Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, silvery or grayish down, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are yellow and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds."
