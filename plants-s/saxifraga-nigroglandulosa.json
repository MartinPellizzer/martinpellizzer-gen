    "intro": "Saxifraga nigroglandulosa, commonly known as the black-gland saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with upright, branched stems that bear small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
