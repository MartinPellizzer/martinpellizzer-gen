    "intro": "Solanum ellipticum var. duribaccalis, commonly known as the thick-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, thick, and often waxy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, which are followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
