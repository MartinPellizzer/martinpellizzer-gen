    "intro": "Sarcochilus teysmannii, commonly known as the Teyssmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It features a distinctive, fleshy, and often reddish-colored pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
