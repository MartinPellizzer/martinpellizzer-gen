It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is noted for its striking, dark red to black flower buds that contrast with the white blooms. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
