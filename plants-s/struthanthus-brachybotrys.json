    "intro": "Struthanthus brachybotrys, commonly known as the short-stemmed flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Struthanthus brachybotrys is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
