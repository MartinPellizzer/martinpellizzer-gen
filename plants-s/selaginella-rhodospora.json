    "intro": "Selaginella rhodospora, commonly known as the red-stemmed spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to regions of North America. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often a striking red or purple color, especially in the stems. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the leaves. Selaginella rhodospora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
