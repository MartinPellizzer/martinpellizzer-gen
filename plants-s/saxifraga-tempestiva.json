    "intro": "Saxifraga tempestiva, commonly known as the storm saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the short growing season, typically in late summer. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing on mountain slopes or in tundra habitats. Saxifraga tempestiva is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds, making it a resilient species in extreme climates."
