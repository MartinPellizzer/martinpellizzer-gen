    "intro": "Saxifraga hirsuta var. sphaeroidea, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low, cushion-like rosettes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
