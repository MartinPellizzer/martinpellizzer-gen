    "intro": "Saxifraga pedemontana subsp. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly habitats, often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The plant produces basal rosettes of dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
