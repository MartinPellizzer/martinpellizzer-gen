It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
