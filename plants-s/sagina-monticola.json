    "intro": "Sagina monticola, commonly known as mountain mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountains of Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Sagina monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
