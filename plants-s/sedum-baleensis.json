It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Sedum baleensis is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
