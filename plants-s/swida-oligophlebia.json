    "intro": "Swida oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf swida, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family, which includes roses, strawberries, and other related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Swida oligophlebia is typically found in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
