    "intro": "Salix ligustrifolia, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the fall. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
