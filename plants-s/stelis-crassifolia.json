    "intro": "Stelis crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its natural habitat in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple, and bloom during the wet season. Stelis crassifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivation."
