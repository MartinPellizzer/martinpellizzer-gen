It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
