    "intro": "Sporobolus \u00d7 bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's needlegrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Sporobolus \u00d7 bolanderi is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
