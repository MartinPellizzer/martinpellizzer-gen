    "intro": "Symplocos oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by berries that turn red when mature. Symplocos oblongifolia thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
