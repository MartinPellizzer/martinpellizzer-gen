    "intro": "Selaginella sclerophila, commonly known as the hard-leaved spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Selaginella sclerophila is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, cone-like structures that produce spores. This species is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its ecological niche."
