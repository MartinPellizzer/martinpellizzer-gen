The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
