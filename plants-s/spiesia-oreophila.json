    "intro": "Spiesia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features erect stems covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the cooler months. Spiesia oreophila is noted for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
