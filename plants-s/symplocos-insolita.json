    "intro": "Symplocos insolita, commonly known as the rare mountain tea, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruits are small, woody drupes that ripen to a dark red or black color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Symplocos insolita is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
