    "intro": "Sisymbrium contortuplicatum var. rectisiliquum, commonly known as the narrow-silique shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, green, triangular pods that mature into distinctive, heart-shaped silique fruits. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often lobed, with a slightly hairy surface. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, preferring full sun. This variant is distinguished by its straight, slender silique structure compared to the more twisted form of the typical species."
