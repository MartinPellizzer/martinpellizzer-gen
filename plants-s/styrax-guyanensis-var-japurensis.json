    "intro": "Styrax guyanensis var. japurensis, commonly known as the Japurensis styrax, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
