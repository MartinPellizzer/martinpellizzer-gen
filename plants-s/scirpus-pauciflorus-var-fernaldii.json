    "intro": "Scirpus pauciflorus var. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, stiff, cylindrical stems that grow from 1 to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wetland environments. This plant is commonly found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
