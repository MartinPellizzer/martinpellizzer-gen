    "intro": "Sedum meyranianum, commonly known as the Meyer's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
