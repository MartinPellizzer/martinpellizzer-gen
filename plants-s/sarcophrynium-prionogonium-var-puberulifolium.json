    "intro": "Sarcophrynium prionogonium var. puberulifolium, commonly known as the velvet-leafed sarcophrynium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"puberulifolium.\" The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small and clustered, often producing bright yellow or orange petals, making it an attractive ornamental plant."
