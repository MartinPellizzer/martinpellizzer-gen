    "intro": "Solanum weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. Solanum weddellii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
