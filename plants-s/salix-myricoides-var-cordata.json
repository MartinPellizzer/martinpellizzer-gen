    "intro": "Salix myricoides var. cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in riparian areas. This variety is often found in moist, sandy soils along streams and riverbanks."
