    "intro": "Silene montifuga, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Silene montifuga is adapted to harsh mountain climates and is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line."
