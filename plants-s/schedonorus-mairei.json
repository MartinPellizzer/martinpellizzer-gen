    "intro": "Schedonorus mairei, commonly known as Maire's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Schedonorus mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
