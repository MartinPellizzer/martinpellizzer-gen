It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Sorbus japonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
