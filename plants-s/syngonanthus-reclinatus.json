    "intro": "Syngonanthus reclinatus, commonly known as the hanging mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the tips of the stems. Syngonanthus reclinatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
