    "intro": "Sedum carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often blooming in late summer."
