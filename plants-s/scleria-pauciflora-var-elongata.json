    "intro": "Scleria pauciflora var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
