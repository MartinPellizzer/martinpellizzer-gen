It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its robust root system allows it to survive in low-water conditions. Salsola malyginii plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
