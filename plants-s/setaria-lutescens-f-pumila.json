    "intro": "Setaria lutescens f. pumila, commonly known as dwarf yellow millet, is a compact, annual grass species native to Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, golden-brown spikelets that mature in late summer. The plant is characterized by its short stature, typically growing no taller than 30 cm, making it suitable for ornamental or ecological landscaping. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, preferring full sun. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
