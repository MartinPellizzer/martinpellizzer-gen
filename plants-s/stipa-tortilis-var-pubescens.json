    "intro": "Stipa tortilis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted clumps of slender, curly leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
