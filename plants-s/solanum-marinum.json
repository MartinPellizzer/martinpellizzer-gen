    "intro": "Solanum marinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive lobed shape, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Solanum marinum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
