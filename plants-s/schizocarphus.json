    "intro": "Schizocarphus, commonly known as the false caryopsis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique fruit structure, which is a dry, indehiscent schizocarp composed of two separate mericarps. Schizocarphus species typically have compound leaves and small, clustered flowers with white or green petals. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in grasslands and woodlands. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
