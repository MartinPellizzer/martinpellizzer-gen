    "intro": "Saxifraga tricuspidata f. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine and rocky environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The leaves are elongated, with a smooth margin that distinguishes it from other saxifrage species. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its botanical features make it a notable species in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
