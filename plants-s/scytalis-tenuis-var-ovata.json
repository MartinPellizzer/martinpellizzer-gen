    "intro": "Scytalis tenuis var. ovata, commonly known as the narrowleaf scytalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas or stream sides. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. This variety is distinguished by its ovate leaf shape, which sets it apart from the typical linear leaves of the species."
