    "intro": "Sambucus sieboldiana f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf Japanese elderberry, is a variant of the elderberry plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that distinguish it from other forms of Sambucus sieboldiana. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. This form is relatively hardy and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates."
