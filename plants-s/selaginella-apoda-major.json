    "intro": "Selaginella apoda major, commonly known as the spike moss, is a type of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique morphology, with a creeping stem that produces upright, spicate branches. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Selaginella apoda major reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms. Its resilience to environmental stress makes it an important component of certain ecosystems."
