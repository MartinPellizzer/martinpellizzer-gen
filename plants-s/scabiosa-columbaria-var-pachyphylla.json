It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers. The leaves are thick and hairy, which helps the plant conserve moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
