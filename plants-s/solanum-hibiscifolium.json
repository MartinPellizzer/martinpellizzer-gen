    "intro": "Solanum hibiscifolium, commonly known as the Hibiscifolium nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of hibiscus plants, hence its common name. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, containing several seeds. Solanum hibiscifolium is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
