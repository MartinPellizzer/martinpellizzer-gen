    "intro": "Saxifraga nivalis subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the slender alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, adapted to retain moisture in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the short summer season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas where it is exposed to strong winds and low temperatures. Saxifraga nivalis subsp. tenuis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine invertebrates."
