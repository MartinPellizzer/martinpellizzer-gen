It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, cylindrical seed heads that release lightweight seeds for wind dispersal.
