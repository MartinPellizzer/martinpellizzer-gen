    "intro": "Sedum rochea, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum rochea is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to prevent soil erosion."
