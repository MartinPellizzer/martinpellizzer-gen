It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Siphanthera species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
