    "intro": "Stichorkis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf stichorkis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. These flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
