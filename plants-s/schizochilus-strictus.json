    "intro": "Schizochilus strictus, commonly known as the rigid schizochilus, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Schizochilus strictus is often found in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
