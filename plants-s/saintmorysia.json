    "intro": "Saintmorysia, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It features showy, dandelion-like yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. Saintmorysia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
