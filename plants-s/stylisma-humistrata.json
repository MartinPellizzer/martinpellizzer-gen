    "intro": "Stylisma humistrata, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its root system helps stabilize the soil in marshy environments, contributing to the ecological health of wetlands. Stylisma humistrata is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants, forming part of the diverse flora in freshwater ecosystems."
