    "intro": "Sarracenia lutea, commonly known as the yellow pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant's bright yellow coloration is due to its high concentration of pigments, particularly carotenoids. Sarracenia lutea thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid environment to maintain its unique trapping mechanism. It plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations in its habitat."
