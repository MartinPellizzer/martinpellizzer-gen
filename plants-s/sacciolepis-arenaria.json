    "intro": "Sacciolepis arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sacciolepis arenaria is well-suited to coastal environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune systems."
