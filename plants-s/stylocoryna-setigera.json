    "intro": "Stylocoryna setigera, commonly known as the creeping rocknettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. Stylocoryna setigera thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
