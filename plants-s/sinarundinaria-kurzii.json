It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread in rocky or moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a feathery appearance, and are typically dark green in color. Sinarundinaria kurzii thrives in shaded, humid conditions and is often found growing on cliffs or in forested areas."
