    "intro": "Salix nakamurana f. yezoalpina, commonly known as the Yezo alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
