    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. praedicandum, commonly known as the purple potato, is a variant of the common potato characterized by its striking violet or purple skin and flesh. This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. It typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, producing tubers underground that are harvested for culinary use. The unique pigmentation of its tubers is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its antioxidant properties. This variety is valued both for its aesthetic appeal and its nutritional content."
