    "intro": "Sporobolus braunii, commonly known as black gram grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its seeds are encased in hard, dark brown pods, which are often used as a forage crop for livestock. Sporobolus braunii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in disturbed soils."
