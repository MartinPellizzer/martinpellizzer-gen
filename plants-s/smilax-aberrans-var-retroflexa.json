    "intro": "Smilax aberrans var. retroflexa, commonly known as the red-berried smilax, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often armed with sharp spines, and its compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to bright red berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the genus Smilax, with unique adaptations for survival in its native habitat."
