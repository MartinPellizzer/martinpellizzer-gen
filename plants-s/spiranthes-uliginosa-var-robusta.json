    "intro": "Spiranthes uliginosa var. robusta, commonly known as the robust lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded environments such as bogs and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
