    "intro": "Syngonium erythrophyllum, commonly known as the red-leaf arrowhead, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant red or pink veins, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Syngonium erythrophyllum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
