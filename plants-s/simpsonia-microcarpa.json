    "intro": "Simpsonia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited Simpsonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Simpsonia microcarpa typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions."
