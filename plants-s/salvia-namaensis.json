    "intro": "Salvia namaensis, commonly known as the Namibian sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Salvia namaensis is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
