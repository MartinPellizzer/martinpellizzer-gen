    "intro": "Silene setacea var. viscida, commonly known as sticky tufted catchfly, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, sticky hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
