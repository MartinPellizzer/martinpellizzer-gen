    "intro": "Salix lucida var. serissima, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and finely toothed, bright yellow-green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its flexible branches and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental planting."
