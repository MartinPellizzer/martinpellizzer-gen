    "intro": "Stelis inclinata, commonly known as the leaning orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. Stelis inclinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and delicate flowers make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
