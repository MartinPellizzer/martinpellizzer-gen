    "intro": "Sedum obcordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky areas of the western United States. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
