    "intro": "Sparganium glomeratum, commonly known as clustered bur-reed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Sparganium glomeratum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
