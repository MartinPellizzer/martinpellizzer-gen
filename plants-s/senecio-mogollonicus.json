    "intro": "Senecio mogollonicus, commonly known as the Mogollon goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Senecio mogollonicus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
