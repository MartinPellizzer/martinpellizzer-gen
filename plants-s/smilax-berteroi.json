    "intro": "Smilax berteroi, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a perennial climbing shrub native to parts of Central and South America. It features a woody stem with sharp, spiny projections, which help it to cling to trees and other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are initially green and turn red when ripe, attracting various bird species. Smilax berteroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
