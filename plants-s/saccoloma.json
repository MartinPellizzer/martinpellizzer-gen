    "intro": "Saccoloma, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. Saccoloma species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. They play an important role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various microorganisms. Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Saccoloma are still used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
