    "intro": "Stigmatopteris litoralis, commonly known as the coastal shield fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are adapted to tolerate saline and humid conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures, including the sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. Stigmatopteris litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
