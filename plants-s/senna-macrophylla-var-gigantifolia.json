    "intro": "Senna macrophylla var. gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant senna, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
