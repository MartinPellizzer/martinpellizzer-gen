    "intro": "Stelis tachirensis, commonly known as the Tachira orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns on the petals. Stelis tachirensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
