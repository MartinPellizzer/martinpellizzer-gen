    "intro": "Stipa hypsophila, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces fluffy, feathery inflorescences that are often white or pale yellow, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa hypsophila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh mountainous regions."
