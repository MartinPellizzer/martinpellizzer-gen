    "intro": "Stachys viscosa, commonly known as sticky weed or woolly betony, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, violet to blue-purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Stachys viscosa is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
