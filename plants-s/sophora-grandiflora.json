    "intro": "Sophora grandiflora, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
