    "intro": "Stigmatopteris gemmipara, commonly known as the gemmiparous shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant reproduces through both spores and vegetative propagation, as it can produce gemmae, which are small, self-contained structures that can grow into new plants. Its fronds are typically evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
