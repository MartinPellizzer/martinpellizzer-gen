    "intro": "Scleria waigiouensis, commonly known as the Waigiouensis bulrush, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers, which are typically borne on tall, slender inflorescences. Scleria waigiouensis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in its habitat."
