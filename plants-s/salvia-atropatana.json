    "intro": "Salvia atropatana, commonly known as Mexican bush sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Salvia atropatana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
