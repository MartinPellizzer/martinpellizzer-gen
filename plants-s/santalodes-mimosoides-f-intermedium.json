    "intro": "Santalodes mimosoides f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate mimosa sandalwood, is a rare and unique variant of the sandalwood genus. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that resemble those of the mimosoides species, while retaining the aromatic properties typical of santalodes. This plant is a hemiparasitic shrub, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
