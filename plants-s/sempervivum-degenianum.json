    "intro": "Sempervivum degenianum, commonly known as the Alpine House sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Sempervivum degenianum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
