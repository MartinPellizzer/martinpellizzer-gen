    "intro": "Solanum dregei, commonly known as the Desert Nightshade, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. Solanum dregei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
