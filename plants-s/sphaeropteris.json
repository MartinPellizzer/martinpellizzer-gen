    "intro": "Sphaeropteris, commonly known as the cycad-like ferns, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Sphaeropteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Sphaeropteris species are known for their unique, palm-like appearance and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The genus includes several species that are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
