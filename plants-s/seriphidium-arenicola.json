    "intro": "Seriphidium arenicola, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Seriphidium arenicola is well-suited to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
