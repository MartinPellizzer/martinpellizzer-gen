It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, narrow leaves and produces spadices that bear small, clustered spikes of flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it an important species for wetland restoration. It plays a vital role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
