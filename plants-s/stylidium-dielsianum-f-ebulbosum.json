    "intro": "Stylidium dielsianum f. ebulbosum, commonly known as the swollen-stem dwarf sun-orchid, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It features a distinctive, swollen stem that stores water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique morphological features that distinguish it from other members of the Stylidium genus."
