    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are borne in compact clusters. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic leaves and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
