    "intro": "Selinum cicutarium, commonly known as hemlock water-dropwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial or annual herb that typically grows in moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can spread rapidly in disturbed soils. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
