It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
