    "intro": "Styrax officinalis var. fulvescens, commonly known as the red-flowered styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and its showy, fragrant red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and glossy foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
