    "intro": "Scrophularia aquatica f. lyrata, commonly known as the aquatic foxglove, is a rare, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
