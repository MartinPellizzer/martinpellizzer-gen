    "intro": "Specklinia nanifolia, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that grow in a rosette pattern, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually dark green with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
