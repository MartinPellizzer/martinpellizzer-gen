    "intro": "Sanguisorba rectispica var. longifila, commonly known as the long-flowered sweet grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland and meadow habitats."
