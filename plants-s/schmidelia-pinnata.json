    "intro": "Schmidelia pinnata, commonly known as the silverleaf schmidelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are typically clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called capsules. Schmidelia pinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
