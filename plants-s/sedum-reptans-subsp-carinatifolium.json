    "intro": "Sedum reptans subsp. carinatifolium, commonly known as the wrinkled stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems that often lie prostrate, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are typically blue-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pale pink to white, appearing in late summer. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
