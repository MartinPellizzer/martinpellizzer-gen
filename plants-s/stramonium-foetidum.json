    "intro": "Stramonium foetidum, commonly known as stinking nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other toxic plants like belladonna and tobacco. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed and can pose a danger to livestock and humans if ingested."
