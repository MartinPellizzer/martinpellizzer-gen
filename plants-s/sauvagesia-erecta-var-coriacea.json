    "intro": "Sauvagesia erecta var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf sauvagesia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems covered in a thick, coriaceous bark that provides structural support and resistance to environmental stress. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in mild climates."
