    "intro": "Saxifraga scleropoda, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, helping to store water in arid environments. Saxifraga scleropoda is often found in mountainous areas and is a characteristic species of tundra and alpine meadows."
