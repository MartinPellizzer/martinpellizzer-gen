    "intro": "Senna hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's senna, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Senna hookeriana is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
