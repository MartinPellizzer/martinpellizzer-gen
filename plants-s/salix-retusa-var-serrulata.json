    "intro": "Salix retusa var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrulate willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for erosion control and habitat restoration."
