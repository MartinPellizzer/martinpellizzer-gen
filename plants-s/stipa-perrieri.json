    "intro": "Stipa perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its fine texture and drought tolerance. Stipa perrieri is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
