    "intro": "Selliguea rigida, commonly known as the rigid moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, carpet-like moss that typically grows on soil, rocks, or tree bark in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and closely appressed, with a distinctive ribbed structure that aids in water retention. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the leafy shoots. Selliguea rigida is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy habitats."
