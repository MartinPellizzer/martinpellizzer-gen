    "intro": "Spiraea flexuosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, lace-like leaves. It produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for borders and containers. The variety stenophylla is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Spiraea species, adding a unique textural element to the garden."
