    "intro": "Smilax bona-nox var. exauriculata, commonly known as the Florida arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with sharp, spiny thorns and dark green, alternate, simple leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wildlife, particularly for birds and small mammals that consume its fruits."
