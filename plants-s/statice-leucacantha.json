    "intro": "Statice leucacantha, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its feathery foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements. Statice leucacantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
