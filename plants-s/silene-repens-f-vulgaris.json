    "intro": "Silene repens f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common bladder campion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with ascending stems that produce small, pink or purple flowers. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, waste grounds, and along roadsides. Silene repens f. vulgaris is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
