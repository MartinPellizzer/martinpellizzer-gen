    "intro": "Styphelia elegans var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lance-leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular plant in native gardens and conservation efforts."
