    "intro": "Saxifraga gasterosteus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and spiny, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries. Saxifraga gasterosteus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
