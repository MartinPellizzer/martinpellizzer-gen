    "intro": "Selago hamulosa, commonly known as the coastal selago, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters. Selago hamulosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
