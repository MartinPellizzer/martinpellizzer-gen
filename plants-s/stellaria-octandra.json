    "intro": "Stellaria octandra, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and has a sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stellaria octandra is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
