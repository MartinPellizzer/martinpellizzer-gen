    "intro": "Salmea eupatoria var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color and produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. This variant is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
