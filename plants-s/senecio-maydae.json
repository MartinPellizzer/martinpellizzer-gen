The plant features yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, creating a starburst-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Senecio maydae is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
