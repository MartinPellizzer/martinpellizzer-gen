    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. lopesiana, commonly known as the Lopes' saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
