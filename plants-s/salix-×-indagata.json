    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 indagata, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. Salix \u00d7 indagata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist, often disturbed soils."
