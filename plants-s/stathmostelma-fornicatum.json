    "intro": "Stathmostelma fornicatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped floral structure that protects its reproductive organs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hood-like bract. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
