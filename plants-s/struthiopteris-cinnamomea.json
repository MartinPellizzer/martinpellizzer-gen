It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant has a distinctive, cinnamon-colored fiddlehead that emerges in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are typically 1 to 3 meters long, with a soft, velvety texture on the underside."
