    "intro": "Sorghum \u00d7 elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's sorghum, is a hybrid grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, which are typically pink to red in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited rainfall. Elliot's sorghum is valued for its forage quality and potential as a biofuel crop."
