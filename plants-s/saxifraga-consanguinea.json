    "intro": "Saxifraga consanguinea, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Saxifraga consanguinea is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
