    "intro": "Sporobolus testudinum, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is widely used for erosion control and as a low-maintenance turfgrass in dry landscapes."
