    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in shallow water and wetlands, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize shoreline soils."
