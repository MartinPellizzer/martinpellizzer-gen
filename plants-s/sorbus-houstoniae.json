    "intro": "Sorbus houstoniae, commonly known as Houston's whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
