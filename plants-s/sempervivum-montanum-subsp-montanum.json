    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum subsp. montanum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a hardy succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with reddish or purple hues, especially in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
