    "intro": "Sesleria calcarea, commonly known as the limestone grass or rock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale green or yellowish flower spikes during the summer months. Sesleria calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to colonize difficult, alkaline soils."
