It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often curved or twisted. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
