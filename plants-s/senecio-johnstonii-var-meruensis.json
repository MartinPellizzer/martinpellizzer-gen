    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii var. meruensis, commonly known as the Meru Senecio, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
