    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea var. montana, commonly known as the Montana pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red to purple-colored, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where it can absorb nutrients from its prey. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety montana is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger pitchers compared to the typical form of S. purpurea."
