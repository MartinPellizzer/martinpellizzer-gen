    "intro": "Senegalia dolichostachya, commonly known as the long-stalked acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically feathery and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in elongated inflorescences, which are a distinguishing feature. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Senegalia dolichostachya is also valued for its hardy nature and use in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood."
