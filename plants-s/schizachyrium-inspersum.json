    "intro": "Schizachyrium inspersum, commonly known as eastern grassland panicum, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces tall, slender stalks with feathery, golden-brown plumes that appear in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. Schizachyrium inspersum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
