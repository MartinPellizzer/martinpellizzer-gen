    "intro": "Spartium pusillum, commonly known as lesser sparrowgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, leathery pods containing minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight pubescence. Spartium pusillum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
