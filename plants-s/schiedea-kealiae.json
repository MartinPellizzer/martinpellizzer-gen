    "intro": "Schiedea kealiae, commonly known as the Kealia snowplant, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Hawaii. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and striking white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Schiedea kealiae is critically endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a significant subject of botanical study."
