    "intro": "Siphisia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly siphisia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of soft, hairy, and often bluish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant."
