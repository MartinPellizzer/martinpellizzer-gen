    "intro": "Sasamorpha sinica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed Chinese sasamorpha, is a rare and unique plant species native to China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves, which lack the typical pubescence found in most members of the genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
