    "intro": "Seraphyta, commonly known as the celestial flower, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a soft blue hue under moonlight. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped blossoms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow during the night. Seraphyta thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific mineral-rich soil to flourish. Its unique botanical features have made it a subject of fascination among botanists and herbalists alike."
