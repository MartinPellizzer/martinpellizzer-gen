    "intro": "Salix exigua var. melanopsis, commonly known as black willow or black-twig willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that becomes fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the fall. This variety is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, where it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
