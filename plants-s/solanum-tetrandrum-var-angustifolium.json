    "intro": "Solanum tetrandrum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark blue, edible berries. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its toxic berries, it should be handled with care."
