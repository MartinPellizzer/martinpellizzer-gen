    "intro": "Safran officinarum, commonly known as the saffron crocus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers, and its most valuable part is the stigmas of the flower, which are harvested and dried to make saffron, a highly prized spice. The cultivation of Safran officinarum requires careful handling due to the labor-intensive process of harvesting the stigmas. Its botanical features make it both economically significant and botanically interesting."
