    "intro": "Sagittaria australis, commonly known as the Australian arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to Australia and surrounding regions. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Sagittaria australis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
