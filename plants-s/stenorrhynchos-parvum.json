    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos parvum, commonly known as the small-leafed stenorrhynchos, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption from poor soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
