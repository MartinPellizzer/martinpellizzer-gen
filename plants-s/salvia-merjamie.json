    "intro": "Salvia merjamie, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems covered in gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and hairy. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom from spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia merjamie is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
