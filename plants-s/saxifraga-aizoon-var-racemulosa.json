    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. racemulosa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
