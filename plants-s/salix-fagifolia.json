    "intro": "Salix fagifolia, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
