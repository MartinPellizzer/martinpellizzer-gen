    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerarum var. laxa, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant has small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a shallow root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
