    "intro": "Scytanthus andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's scytanthus, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the island of Madagascar, where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. It typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
