    "intro": "Sloanea rojasiae, commonly known as the Guatemalan sloanea, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, lowland tropical forests. The plant features elliptical to ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
