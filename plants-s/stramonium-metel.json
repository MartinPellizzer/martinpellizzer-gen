    "intro": "Stramonium metel, commonly known as thornapple, is a flowering plant native to Asia and parts of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy purple or blue flowers. The plant produces small, green berries that ripen to a yellowish color, containing toxic seeds. Stramonium metel contains various alkaloids, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which contribute to its medicinal and toxic properties. It has been used historically in traditional medicine but requires careful handling due to its potent effects."
