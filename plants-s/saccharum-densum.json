    "intro": "Saccharum densum, commonly known as the dense cane grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous stalks that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Saccharum densum is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
