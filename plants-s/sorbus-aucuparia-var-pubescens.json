    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy rowan, is a variant of the rowan tree characterized by its hairy or pubescent surfaces on leaves, stems, and fruits. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in woodlands and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges, and the flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences. The downy rowan is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitats."
