    "intro": "Sarcorrhiza epiphytica, commonly known as the aerial orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of roots, relying instead on aerial roots for water and mineral absorption. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure is adapted for life in the canopy of trees, where it can access light and moisture. Sarcorrhiza epiphytica plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
