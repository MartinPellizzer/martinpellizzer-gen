    "intro": "Stipa zalesskyi subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought and cold temperatures. Its morphology and ecological preferences make it an important component of its native grassland ecosystems."
