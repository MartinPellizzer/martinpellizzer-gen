    "intro": "Senecio glaucus subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the blueweed or glaucous groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its blue to gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for xeriscaping."
