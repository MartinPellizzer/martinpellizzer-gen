    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. racemosum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
