    "intro": "Stellina hamulata, commonly known as the hooked starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a fibrous root system and succulent, hairy stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, often covered in fine pubescence. Stellina hamulata is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes."
