    "intro": "Stenocereus stellatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a columnar cactus with a spiny exterior and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are ribbed and can store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
