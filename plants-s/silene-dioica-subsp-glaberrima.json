    "intro": "Silene dioica subsp. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its subspecific name, *glaberrima*, refers to its relatively smooth, less hairy appearance compared to other subspecies."
