    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea f. compacta, commonly known as the compact goldenrod, is a compact form of the common goldenrod. It is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its compact structure makes it a popular choice for garden use due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
