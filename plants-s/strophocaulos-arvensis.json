    "intro": "Strophocaulos arvensis, commonly known as the field bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The flowers are tubular with five lobes and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
