    "intro": "Salix sphaeronymphe var. sphaeronymphoides, commonly known as the spherical willow, is a rare and unique variant of the willow genus. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical growth habit, which sets it apart from typical willow species. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces catkins that are often yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
