    "intro": "Stachys alopecuros subsp. divulsa, commonly known as the slender betony, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
