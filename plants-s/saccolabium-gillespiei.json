    "intro": "Saccolabium gillespiei, commonly known as the Gillespie's saccolabium, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and New Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments with high temperatures and limited rainfall. Saccolabium gillespiei plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for desert wildlife."
