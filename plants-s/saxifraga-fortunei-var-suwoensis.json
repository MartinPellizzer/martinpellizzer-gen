    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. suwoensis, commonly known as the Suwo saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It typically features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often bluish-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in its arid or rocky habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural gardens."
