    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 huteri, commonly known as the \"hen and chicks,\" is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, with fleshy, pointed leaves that are often covered in a layer of white wax. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and grown independently. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Sempervivum \u00d7 huteri is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
