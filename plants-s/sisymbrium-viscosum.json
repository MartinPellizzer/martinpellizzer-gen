    "intro": "Sisymbrium viscosum, commonly known as sticky shepherd's purse, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular seed pods that are covered in a sticky substance, which helps in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Sisymbrium viscosum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
