    "intro": "Spiranthes lacera, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. Spiranthes lacera is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
