    "intro": "Sesleria tenuifolia subsp. kalnikensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green coloration, often growing in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, well-drained environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
