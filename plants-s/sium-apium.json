    "intro": "Sium apium, commonly known as water parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its small white or greenish flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Sium apium is valued for its edible leaves and roots, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
