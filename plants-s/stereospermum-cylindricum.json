It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by bright orange, fleshy fruits resembling star-shaped berries. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
