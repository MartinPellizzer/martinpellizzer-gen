    "intro": "Sorbus eminentoides, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
