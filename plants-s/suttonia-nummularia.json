    "intro": "Suttonia nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Suttonia nummularia thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
