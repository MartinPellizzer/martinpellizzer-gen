    "intro": "Stipa effusa, commonly known as the broadleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa effusa is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
