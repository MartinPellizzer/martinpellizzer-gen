    "intro": "Sorbus rufopilosa var. rufopilosa, commonly known as the red-branch whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
