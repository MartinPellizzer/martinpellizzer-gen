    "intro": "Siphocolea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. Siphocolea species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, sunny environments. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
