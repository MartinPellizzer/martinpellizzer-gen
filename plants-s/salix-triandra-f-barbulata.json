    "intro": "Salix triandra f. barbulata, commonly known as the silky willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and its distinctive, silky-hairy leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments. This variety is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
