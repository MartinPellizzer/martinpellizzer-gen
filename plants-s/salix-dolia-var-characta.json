    "intro": "Salix dolia var. characta, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
