    "intro": "Stelis majuscula, commonly known as the large-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Stelis majuscula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
