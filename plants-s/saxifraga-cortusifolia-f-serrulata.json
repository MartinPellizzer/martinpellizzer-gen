    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia f. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins that give the plant its distinguishing name. Native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments. This variant is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
