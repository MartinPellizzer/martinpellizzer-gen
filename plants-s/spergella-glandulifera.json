    "intro": "Spergella glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular liverwort, is a small, perennial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and the presence of small, glandular dots on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Spergella glandulifera plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
