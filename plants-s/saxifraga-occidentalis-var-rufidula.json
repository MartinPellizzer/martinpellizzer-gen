    "intro": "Saxifraga occidentalis var. rufidula, commonly known as the redstem saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and have a rough, slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its reddish stems and bracts, which give it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
