    "intro": "Salix appropinquata, commonly known as the near river willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it useful for erosion control and habitat restoration."
