    "intro": "Salix caprea var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly coating on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its role in early pollination and ecological succession."
