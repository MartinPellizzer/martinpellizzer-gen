    "intro": "Spiranthes yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the humid forests of Bolivia and Peru. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-like arrangement of flowers, which is a distinctive feature of the Spiranthes genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in association with other epiphytic plants. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, producing fragrant, white to pale yellow blooms. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
