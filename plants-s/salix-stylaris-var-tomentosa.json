    "intro": "Salix stylaris var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
