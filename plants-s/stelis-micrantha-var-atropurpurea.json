    "intro": "Stelis micrantha var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-stemmed orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that are often tinged with a deep purple hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
