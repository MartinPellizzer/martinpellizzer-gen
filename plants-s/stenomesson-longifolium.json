    "intro": "Stenomesson longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved stenomesson, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette, with elongated stems that support its showy yellow to orange composite flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and low moisture availability. Stenomesson longifolium is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
