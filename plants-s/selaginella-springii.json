    "intro": "Selaginella springii, commonly known as the Spring's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a dense, moss-like stem and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Selaginella springii is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
