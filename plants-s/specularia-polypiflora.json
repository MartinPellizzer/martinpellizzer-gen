    "intro": "Specularia polypiflora, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
