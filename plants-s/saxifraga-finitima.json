    "intro": "Saxifraga finitima, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky and barren environments, often found on tundra and alpine slopes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh climates. Saxifraga finitima is well-suited to cold temperatures and has a short growing season."
