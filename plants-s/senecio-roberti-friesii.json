It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
