    "intro": "Scirpus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its distinctive, soft, white-tipped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in marshy areas, pond edges, and along stream banks, where it helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Scirpus lanatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
