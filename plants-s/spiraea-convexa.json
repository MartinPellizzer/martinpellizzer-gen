    "intro": "Spiraea convexa, commonly known as the rounded spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with slender, arching branches that add a graceful appearance to gardens. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraea convexa is well-suited for borders, rock gardens, or as a specimen plant due to its compact size and ornamental value."
