    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subvar. homophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring to early summer, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
