    "intro": "Schoenoplectus olneyi, commonly known as Olney's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Schoenoplectus olneyi plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
