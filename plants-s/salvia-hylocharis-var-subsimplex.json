    "intro": "Salvia hylocharis var. subsimplex, commonly known as the simpleleaf blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its foliage is aromatic, often emitting a mild mint-like scent when crushed. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
