    "intro": "Secale pumilum, commonly known as dwarf rye, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, and is adapted to temperate climates. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its size and resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
