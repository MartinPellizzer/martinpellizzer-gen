    "intro": "Spiraea schneideriana var. amphidoxa, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its tidy form and seasonal color changes, from vibrant green in spring to fiery red in autumn."
