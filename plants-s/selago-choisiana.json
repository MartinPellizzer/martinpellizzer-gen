    "intro": "Selago choisiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, delicate flowers that often appear without leaves. The plant typically grows on tree branches or in shaded, humid environments, relying on specific host trees for support. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinct, intricate structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Selago choisiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
