    "intro": "Symphyglossum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the understory of shaded forests in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires a cool, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
