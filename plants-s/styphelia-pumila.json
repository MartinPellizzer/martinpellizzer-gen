    "intro": "Styphelia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate touch to its dense foliage. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with compact, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial shade to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Styphelia pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal blooms."
