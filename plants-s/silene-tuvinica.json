It is a perennial herb with slender stems and basal leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Silene tuvinica is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
