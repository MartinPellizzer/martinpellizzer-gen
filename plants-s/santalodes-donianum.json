    "intro": "Santalodes donianum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic shrub belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its fragrant wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as a vulnerable species."
