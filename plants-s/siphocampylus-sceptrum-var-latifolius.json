    "intro": "Siphocampylus sceptrum var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf siphocampylus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct veining pattern. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
