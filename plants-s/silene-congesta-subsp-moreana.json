    "intro": "Silene congesta subsp. moreana, commonly known as the Alpine campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features showy pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Silene congesta subsp. moreana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
