    "intro": "Saxifraga media, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Saxifraga media is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
