It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The leaves are broad, ovate to rounded in shape, and often have a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
