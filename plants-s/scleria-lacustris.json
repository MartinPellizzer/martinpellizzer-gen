    "intro": "Scleria lacustris, commonly known as the lake sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. Scleria lacustris plays a role in stabilizing shoreline soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
