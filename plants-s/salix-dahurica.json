    "intro": "Salix dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix dahurica is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
