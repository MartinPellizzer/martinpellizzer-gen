    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum f. obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed Chinese tallow tree, is a variant of the Chinese tallow tree native to East Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its obovate, glossy leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It has a shallow root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
