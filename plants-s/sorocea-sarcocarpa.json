    "intro": "Sorocea sarcocarpa, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Sorocea sarcocarpa is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
