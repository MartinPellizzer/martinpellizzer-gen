    "intro": "Styrax micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, providing ornamental value throughout the growing season. Styrax micranthus is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
