    "intro": "Serapias lingua subsp. excavata, commonly known as the Carpathian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
