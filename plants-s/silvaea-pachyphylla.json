    "intro": "Silvaea pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved woodbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, woodland environments. Silvaea pachyphylla is often found in shaded areas, such as along stream banks and in forest understories."
