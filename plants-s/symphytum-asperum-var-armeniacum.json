    "intro": "Symphytum asperum var. armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces tall, upright stems with clusters of violet or blue flowers during the summer months. It is known for its strong, mucilaginous roots, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
