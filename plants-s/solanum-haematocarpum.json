    "intro": "Solanum haematocarpum, commonly known as the bloodfruit or red berry plant, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, red, fleshy berries that contain toxic compounds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are usually yellow or green with a distinctive shape. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
