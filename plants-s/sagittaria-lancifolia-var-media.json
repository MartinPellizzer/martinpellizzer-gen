    "intro": "Sagittaria lancifolia var. media, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and shallow waters, where it forms dense stands. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with slender, grass-like stems. Its small white flowers appear in summer, and it produces distinctive three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by water. This species is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a habitat for aquatic organisms."
