    "intro": "Selaginella confusa var. densa, commonly known as the dense spore moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with dense, clustered stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper stems and contain the spores necessary for propagation. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
