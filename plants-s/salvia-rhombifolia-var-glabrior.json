    "intro": "Salvia rhombifolia var. glabrior, commonly known as the smoothleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, rhombic-shaped leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
