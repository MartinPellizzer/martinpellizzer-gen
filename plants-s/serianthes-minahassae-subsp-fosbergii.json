    "intro": "Serianthes minahassae subsp. fosbergii, commonly known as the Fosberg's ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
