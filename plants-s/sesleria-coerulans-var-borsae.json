It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes."
