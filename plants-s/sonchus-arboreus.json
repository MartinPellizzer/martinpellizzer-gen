    "intro": "Sonchus arboreus, commonly known as tree sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its upright stem and lobed, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Botanically, it is distinguished by its milky sap and the presence of sesquiterpene lactones in its tissues."
