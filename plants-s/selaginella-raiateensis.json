It is native to the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a dense, low-growing mat of foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its sporophytic structures, including strobila, are prominent and contribute to its reproductive strategy. Selaginella raiateensis is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and its unique aesthetic appeal in botanical collections."
