    "intro": "Salix nigrescens, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its dark, almost black bark that becomes more prominent with age. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a smooth margin. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
