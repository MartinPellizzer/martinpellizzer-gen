    "intro": "Sagittaria bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that emerge from a bulb-like structure at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its roots help stabilize soil in aquatic environments, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Sagittaria bulbosa is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
