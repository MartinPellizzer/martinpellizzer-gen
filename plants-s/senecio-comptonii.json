    "intro": "Senecio comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio comptonii produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer."
