These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers with five petals, often surrounded by sepals that resemble petals. Symphyogyne species are typically found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in wetlands or along stream banks. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a distinctive lobed or divided structure. Many species are herbaceous perennials, and their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
