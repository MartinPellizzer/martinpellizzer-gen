It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
