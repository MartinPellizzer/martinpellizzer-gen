    "intro": "Saurauia costaricensis var. brachitricha, commonly known as the Costa Rican saurauia, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of Costa Rica and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the wet season, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in montane cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
