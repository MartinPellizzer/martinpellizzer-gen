    "intro": "Schizochilus pulchellus, commonly known as the white orchid, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elegant, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle pink or purple tinge. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its native habitat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, which is crucial for its survival in humid environments. Schizochilus pulchellus is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticultural settings."
