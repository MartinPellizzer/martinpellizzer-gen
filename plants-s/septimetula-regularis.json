    "intro": "Septimetula regularis, commonly known as the regular sprout, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces tiny, pale blue flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its botanical structure is notable for its symmetrical arrangement of leaves and flowers, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Septimetula regularis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
