It features small, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a subtle, aromatic scent. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance garden plant. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and long blooming period, making it popular in rock gardens and borders."
