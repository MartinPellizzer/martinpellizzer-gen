    "intro": "Statice sinuata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, spindly stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Statice sinuata is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
