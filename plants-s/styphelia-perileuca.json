    "intro": "Styphelia perileuca, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its compact form. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia perileuca is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
