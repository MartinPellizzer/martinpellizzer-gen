    "intro": "Saxifraga blavii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and lobed, with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Saxifraga blavii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
