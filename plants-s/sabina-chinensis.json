    "intro": "Sabina chinensis, commonly known as Chinese juniper, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and its small, berry-like cones. The plant is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively resistant to pests and diseases. Sabina chinensis is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
