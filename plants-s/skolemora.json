    "intro": "Skolemora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, pale flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with dark green, leathery leaves. Skolemora thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a conservation concern."
