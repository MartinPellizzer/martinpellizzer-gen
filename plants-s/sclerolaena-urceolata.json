    "intro": "Sclerolaena urceolata, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped structure. Its scientific name reflects its rigid (sclerous) leaves and urn-shaped (urceolata) flower heads. Sclerolaena urceolata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
