It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Seaforthia latisecta is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
