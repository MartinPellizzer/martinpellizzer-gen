    "intro": "Spathoglottis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Thailand and Vietnam. It thrives in calcareous soils, often growing in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive spathaceous bract that resembles a spathe. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
