    "intro": "Sphaeropteris parianensis, commonly known as the Pariangan cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, featuring a large, cone-like strobilus that produces both male and female spores. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
