    "intro": "Sprekelia cybister var. brevis, commonly known as the dwarf spider lily, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Sprekelia cybister. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to diverse garden settings."
