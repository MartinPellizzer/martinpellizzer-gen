    "intro": "Sidalcea, commonly known as checkerblooms, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These perennial herbs are native to western North America, particularly the western United States and parts of Canada. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble small blooms clustered together. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce pods that split open to release seeds. Sidalcea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
