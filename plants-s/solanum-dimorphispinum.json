    "intro": "Solanum dimorphispinum, commonly known as the two-form thorned nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive two forms of leaves and spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
