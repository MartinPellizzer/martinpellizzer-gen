    "intro": "Saponaria pumila, commonly known as \"soaproot\" or \"pumila saponaria,\" is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate dry conditions. The roots of Saponaria pumila contain saponins, which give the plant its common name and have been used historically for their soap-like properties."
