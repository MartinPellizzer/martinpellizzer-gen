    "intro": "Solanum uchubita, commonly known as the Uchubita nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens and landscapes."
