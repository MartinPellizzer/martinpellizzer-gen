    "intro": "Stelis candida, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. Stelis candida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
