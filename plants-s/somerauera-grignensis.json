    "intro": "Somerauera grignensis, commonly known as the Grignan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
