    "intro": "Spartina patens var. caespitosa, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variant is particularly adapted to saline and brackish environments, thriving in marshes and tidal flats. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
