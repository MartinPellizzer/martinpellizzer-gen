    "intro": "Sideroxylon lauraceum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or greenish-yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Sideroxylon lauraceum thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
