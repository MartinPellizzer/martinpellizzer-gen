    "intro": "Stachys recta subsp. tenoreana, commonly known as the Sicilian betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It features upright, square stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
