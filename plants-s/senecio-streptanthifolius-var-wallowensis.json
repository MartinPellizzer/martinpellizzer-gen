    "intro": "Senecio streptanthifolius var. wallowensis, commonly known as the Wallowa senecio, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
