    "intro": "Scilla montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, and its bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Scilla montenegrina is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
