It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. Its growth habit is low and compact, making it well-suited for alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Senecio frigidus var. ulmeri is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
