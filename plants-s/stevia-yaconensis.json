The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its roots are rich in carbohydrates and contain natural sweeteners called steviol glycosides, making it a popular alternative to sugar. Stevia yaconensis is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
