It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are adapted for wind pollination. Setaria bongaensis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is valued for its potential in forage and soil stabilization in agricultural settings."
