    "intro": "Sarcolobus globosus, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to green flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common in wetland ecosystems. Sarcolobus globosus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
