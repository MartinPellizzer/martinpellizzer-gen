    "intro": "Semiliquidambar, commonly known as the golden maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking golden foliage, which turns vibrant shades of yellow in the fall. The tree has a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are palmately lobed, typically with three to five lobes, and are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds in the spring."
