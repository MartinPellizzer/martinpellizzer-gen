It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers. Scaphyglottis caquetana is adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to waterlogged conditions."
