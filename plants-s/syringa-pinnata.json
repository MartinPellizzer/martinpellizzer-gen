    "intro": "Syringa pinnata, commonly known as the fragrant viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, pinnate leaves that are typically 4 to 8 inches long. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Syringa pinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
