    "intro": "Solanum pachystylum, commonly known as the thick-stemmed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and broad, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. Following flowering, it develops small, round berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. Solanum pachystylum is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
