    "intro": "Salix glauca var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are broad and have a silvery underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
