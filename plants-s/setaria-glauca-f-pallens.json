It is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its pale green foliage distinguishes it from the typical green form of Setaria glauca. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional herbal practices."
