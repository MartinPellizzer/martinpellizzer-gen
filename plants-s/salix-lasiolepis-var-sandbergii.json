    "intro": "Salix lasiolepis var. sandbergii, commonly known as Sandberg's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are elliptic to lanceolate, with a rough, sandpapery texture and a bluish-green color on the upper surface. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers on separate plants, typical of willow species. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
