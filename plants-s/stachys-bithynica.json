    "intro": "Stachys bithynica, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces delicate, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. Stachys bithynica is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
