    "intro": "Smilax longibracteolata, commonly known as the long-bract smilacina, is a species of vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which are typical of the Smilacaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Smilax longibracteolata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail through vegetation."
