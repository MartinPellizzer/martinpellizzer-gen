It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
