    "intro": "Salvia venosa, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue to purple flower clusters that resemble mist, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Salvia venosa is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees, contributing to its ecological value."
