    "intro": "Scandix pecten-veneris subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble the shell of the Venus' flower basket, a type of deep-sea sponge. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are adapted to salty, windy environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies brachycarpa is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruiting structures compared to other subspecies of the species."
