It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and coastal areas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It has a widespread distribution along coastal regions of the Americas and is often found in marshes and tidal flats. Sarcocornia obclavata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
