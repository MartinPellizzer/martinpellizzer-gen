    "intro": "Solanum cuevoanum, commonly known as the Cuevoanum nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening. The fruit is a red, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, though the plant is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
