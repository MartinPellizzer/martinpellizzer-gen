    "intro": "Sporobolus capensis var. microspiculus, commonly known as the Cape spurgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and is adapted to dry, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and other arid environments. Its small seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
