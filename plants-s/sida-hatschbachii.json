    "intro": "Sida hatschbachii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sida hatschbachii is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
