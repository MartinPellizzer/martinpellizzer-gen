    "intro": "Selaginella rigidula, commonly known as the clubmoss or resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. One of its most remarkable traits is its ability to survive extreme dehydration, entering a state of dormancy that allows it to \"resurrect\" when water becomes available. This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
