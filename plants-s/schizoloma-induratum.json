    "intro": "Schizoloma induratum, commonly known as the rough-hairless lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its thick, leathery thallus with a dark, often reddish or brownish upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal component. It thrives in rocky and shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Schizoloma induratum is known for its chemical compounds, including usnic acid, which contributes to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
