    "intro": "Scoliotheca, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, comprises several species characterized by their aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. These plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that often resemble those of carrots or parsley. Scoliotheca species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or rocky habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and some species are used in traditional medicine. The genus is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native environments."
