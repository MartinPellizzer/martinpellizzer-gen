It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its unique sticky texture and adaptability to arid conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
