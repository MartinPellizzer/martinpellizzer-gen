    "intro": "Stellaria pumila, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, giving it its scientific name. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Stellaria pumila is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in gardens and meadows."
