    "intro": "Salacia lehmbachii var. usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara salacia, is a flowering plant native to the montane rainforests of East Africa. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other members of the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
