    "intro": "Staphidium naevulum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, spotted leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface and prominent, irregularly arranged spots. Its reproductive structures include a slender, erect flower spike bearing small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked despite their ornamental value."
