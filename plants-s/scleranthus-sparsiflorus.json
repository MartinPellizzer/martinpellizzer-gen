    "intro": "Scleranthus sparsiflorus, commonly known as the sparseflower thornweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer."
