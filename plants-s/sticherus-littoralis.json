    "intro": "Sticherus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sticherus, is a small, flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the edges of tidal pools and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it a hardy species in brackish environments. Sticherus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
