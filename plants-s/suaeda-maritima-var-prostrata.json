    "intro": "Suaeda maritima var. prostrata, commonly known as sea spurrey, is a low-growing, succulent plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and salt marshes. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems produce clusters of yellow flowers, which attract pollinators. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate high salinity and withstand harsh maritime climates."
