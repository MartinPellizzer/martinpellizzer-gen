    "intro": "Symphyopappus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved symphyopappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fluffy, wind-dispersed seed head. Symphyopappus angustifolius is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low-growing habit to conserve water."
