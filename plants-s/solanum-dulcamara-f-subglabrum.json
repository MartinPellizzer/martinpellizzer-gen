It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale green or white, followed by berries that mature to a deep purple color. It is a perennial vine that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
