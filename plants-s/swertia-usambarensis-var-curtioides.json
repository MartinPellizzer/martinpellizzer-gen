    "intro": "Swertia usambarensis var. curtioides, commonly known as the East African swertia, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of East Africa. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
