    "intro": "Stipa alpestris, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-green inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue due to the presence of silica in its cells. Stipa alpestris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
