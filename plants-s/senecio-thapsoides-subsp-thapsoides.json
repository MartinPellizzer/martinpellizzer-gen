    "intro": "Senecio thapsoides subsp. thapsoides, commonly known as yellow star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has basal and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America."
