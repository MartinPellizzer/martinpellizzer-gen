    "intro": "Solanum ipomaeoides, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruits are small, yellow berries that mature in the fall, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
