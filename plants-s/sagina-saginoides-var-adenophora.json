    "intro": "Sagina saginoides var. adenophora, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, crowded leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it a common ground cover in its native habitats."
