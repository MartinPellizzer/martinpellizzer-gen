    "intro": "Sapindus tetraphyllus, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The tree produces spherical, spiny fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a starchy, soap-like pulp. The fruit's pulp is used in traditional medicine and as a natural detergent due to its saponin content. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
