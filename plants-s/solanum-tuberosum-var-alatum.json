    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. alatum, commonly known as the winged potato, is a variant of the common potato with distinctive foliage. Its leaves are characterized by their wing-like extensions, which give the plant its unique appearance. This variety is native to the Andes and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments. The plant produces tubers similar to the common potato, though they may have a slightly different texture and flavor. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage, though it can also be used for culinary use."
