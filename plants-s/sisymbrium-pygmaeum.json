    "intro": "Sisymbrium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf winter cress, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often covered in fine hairs. Sisymbrium pygmaeum is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
