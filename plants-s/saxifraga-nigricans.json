    "intro": "Saxifraga nigricans, commonly known as the black saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, dark red or black flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga nigricans is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
