    "intro": "Struthanthus jatibocensis, commonly known as the Jatibocensis ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Panama. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in the early morning, often in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
