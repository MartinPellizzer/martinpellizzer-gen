    "intro": "Sida peduncularis, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fibrous roots and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Sida peduncularis is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
