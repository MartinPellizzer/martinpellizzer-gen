    "intro": "Silene inflata subsp. vesicaria, commonly known as the inflated catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, inflated seed pods that resemble small, balloon-like structures, which give the plant its common name. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more inflated pods compared to other subspecies of Silene inflata."
