It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its violet-colored flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is known for its intense sweetness, similar to other stevia species, though it is less commonly used as a sweetener. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for cultivation in temperate climates. Stevia violacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
