    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
