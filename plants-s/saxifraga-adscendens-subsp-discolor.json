    "intro": "Saxifraga adscendens subsp. discolor, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats of foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by its white-variegated leaves, which feature a striking contrast of green and white markings. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and often display a pale pink to white color. This hardy plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other species can survive."
