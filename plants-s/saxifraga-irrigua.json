    "intro": "Saxifraga irrigua, commonly known as the water saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine tundra and wet meadows. Saxifraga irrigua is an important component of the flora in its native habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
