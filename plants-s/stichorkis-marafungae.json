    "intro": "Stichorkis marafungae, commonly known as the Marafunga stichorkis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of Malagasy flora and conservation efforts in the region."
