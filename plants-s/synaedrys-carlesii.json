    "intro": "Synaedrys carlesii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers that resemble a star, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single, highly ornate floral spike each growing season. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
