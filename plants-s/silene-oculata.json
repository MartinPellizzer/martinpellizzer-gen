It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble tiny eyes, with a central yellow spot surrounded by red petals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene oculata is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
