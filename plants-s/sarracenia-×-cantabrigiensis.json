    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 cantabrigiensis, commonly known as the Cambridge sarracenia, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the eastern United States. It is a cross between Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra, resulting in a plant with distinctive red and green striped leaves. The plant's pitcher-shaped leaves are adapted to trap and digest insects, a key feature of its carnivorous nature. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a popular specimen among plant enthusiasts and researchers."
