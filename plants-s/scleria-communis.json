    "intro": "Scleria communis, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicle-like structures. Scleria communis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
