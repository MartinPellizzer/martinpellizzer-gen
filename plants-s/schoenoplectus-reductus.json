    "intro": "Schoenoplectus reductus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. This plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically important in wetland habitats. Schoenoplectus reductus plays a key role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
