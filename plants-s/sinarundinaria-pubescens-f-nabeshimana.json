    "intro": "Sinarundinaria pubescens f. nabeshimana, commonly known as the Nabeshimana form, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive pubescent surface covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens. This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
