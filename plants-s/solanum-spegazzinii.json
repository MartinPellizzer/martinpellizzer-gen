    "intro": "Solanum spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them harmful to humans and livestock. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it has been the subject of some botanical study."
