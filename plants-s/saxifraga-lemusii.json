    "intro": "Saxifraga lemusii, commonly known as the Lemus's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, often white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Saxifraga lemusii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
