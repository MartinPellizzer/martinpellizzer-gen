    "intro": "Smilax azorica, commonly known as the Madeira arrowroot, is a climbing shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stems and persistent, spiny tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spadices, followed by red berries containing seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Smilax azorica is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
