    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos vestigiatus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, compact growth habit and its striking, showy flowers that resemble small, ghostly figures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on epiphytic growth for nutrients and moisture. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
