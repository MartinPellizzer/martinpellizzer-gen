    "intro": "Solanum confusum, commonly known as the confused nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is typically found in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Solanum confusum is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it often grows in dense undergrowth. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
