It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum oblongum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
