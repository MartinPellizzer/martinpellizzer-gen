    "intro": "Serratula tinctoria var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable serrated centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either basal or alternate, and serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from June to September. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dyeing, it has been cultivated in some regions for traditional purposes."
