    "intro": "Salix babylonica f. annularis, commonly known as the weeping willow with annular bark, is a unique cultivar of the weeping willow tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, flaky, and peeling bark that gives it a striking, almost artistic appearance. The plant features long, cascading branches that create a graceful, flowing silhouette. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, light green color. This ornamental tree is often planted in gardens or near water features for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
