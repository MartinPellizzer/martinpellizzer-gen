    "intro": "Smithia ciliata var. minima, commonly known as the miniature ciliate Smithia, is a rare and delicate plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, white flowers clustered in umbels. Native to specific regions in the mountainous areas of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in rocky or woodland soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
