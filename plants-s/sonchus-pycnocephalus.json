    "intro": "Sonchus pycnocephalus, commonly known as the dense-headed sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces a tall, branching stem that bears numerous small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, though they are often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
