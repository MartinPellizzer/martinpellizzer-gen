    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 discolor var. bellona, commonly known as the bellona stapelia, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, resembling the shape of a flower but with a unique, sometimes bizarre appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal water to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
