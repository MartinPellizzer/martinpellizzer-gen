It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched structure and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Seriphidium saissanicum is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
