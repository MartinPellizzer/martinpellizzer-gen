    "intro": "Selaginella nodosa, commonly known as the nodular spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to parts of North America. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Selaginella nodosa is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
