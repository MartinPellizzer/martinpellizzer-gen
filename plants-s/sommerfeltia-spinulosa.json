    "intro": "Sommerfeltia spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny sommerfeltia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly rough texture, and the plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Sommerfeltia spinulosa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions."
