    "intro": "Schiedea verticillata, commonly known as the Hawaiian treefern, is a unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a fern that grows as a tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant is characterized by its ability to form a rosette of leaves at the base, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Schiedea verticillata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. It plays an important ecological role in the native flora of Hawaii."
