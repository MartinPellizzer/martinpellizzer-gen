It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs. Staelia catechosperma is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in dry, sunny conditions. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
