    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. spuria, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a variant of the grey willow native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) foliage, which provides a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats, such as riverbanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a pale underside. It produces catkins in early spring, contributing to its role in early pollination and ecological succession."
