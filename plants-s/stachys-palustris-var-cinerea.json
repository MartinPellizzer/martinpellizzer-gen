    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. cinerea, commonly known as silver hedge-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It features dense, hairy foliage that is typically grayish-white to silver in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often have a rough,\u6da9 texture, while its stems are square and covered in fine hairs. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
