    "intro": "Stephanodaphne pulchra, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
