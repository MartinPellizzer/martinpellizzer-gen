    "intro": "Schisandra elongata var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed schisandra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its specific epithet \"dentata.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
