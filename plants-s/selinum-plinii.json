    "intro": "Selinum plinii, commonly known as the giant arum, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, and its dramatic, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a showy purple spathe. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and indoor spaces. Selinum plinii is also known for its ability to produce a strong, pungent odor, which is released when the plant is disturbed."
