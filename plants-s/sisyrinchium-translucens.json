It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It produces numerous slender, erect stems that bear clusters of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.
