    "intro": "Saussurea fruticulosa, commonly known as the Himalayan thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with a woody base and spiny leaves that help it survive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
