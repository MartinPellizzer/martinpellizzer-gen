    "intro": "Specklinia vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's sympodial orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs and fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
