It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often covered in a layer of soft, cartilaginous tissue. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
