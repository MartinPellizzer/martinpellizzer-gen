    "intro": "Saxifraga fonticola, commonly known as the spring saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Saxifraga fonticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, moisture-retentive conditions."
