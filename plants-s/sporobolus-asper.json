    "intro": "Sporobolus asper, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its wiry, upright growth habit and rough, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Sporobolus asper is adapted to arid conditions and is considered drought-tolerant."
