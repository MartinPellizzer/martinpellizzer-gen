    "intro": "Salix argentea, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and silvery-white undersides on its leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Silver willow thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
