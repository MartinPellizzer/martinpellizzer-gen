    "intro": "Sagittaria calycina var. media, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or grow submerged, with a distinctive V-shaped leaf blade. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and pond edges. Sagittaria calycina var. media is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
