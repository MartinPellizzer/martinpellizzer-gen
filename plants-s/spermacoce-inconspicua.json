    "intro": "Spermacoce inconspicua, commonly known as the small false pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Spermacoce inconspicua is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks."
