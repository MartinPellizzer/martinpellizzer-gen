    "intro": "Salix myrsinites var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The leaves and branches are often used in traditional basket-weaving due to their flexibility and durability."
