    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its foliage is often a vibrant green in summer, turning yellow in autumn, and it plays a role in providing habitat for various wildlife species. The variety subrotunda is distinguished by its more elongated and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Salix nigricans."
