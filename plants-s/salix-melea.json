    "intro": "Salix melea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often wet environments such as stream banks and marshy areas. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically male and female, and they appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin strips."
