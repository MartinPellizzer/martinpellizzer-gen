    "intro": "Selaginella effusa var. dulongjiangensis, commonly known as the Dulongjiang Spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats, typically found in shaded, moist environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which is a key feature of its evolutionary adaptation. It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for studying plant evolution and conservation biology."
