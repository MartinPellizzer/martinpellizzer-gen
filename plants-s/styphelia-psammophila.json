    "intro": "Styphelia psammophila, commonly known as the sandplain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal dunes of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers during the spring and early summer. Styphelia psammophila is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
