    "intro": "Senecio pluricephalus, commonly known as the \"many-headed senecio,\" is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is native to South Africa and features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. Senecio pluricephalus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
