    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii var. erici-rosenii, commonly known as the Johnston's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
