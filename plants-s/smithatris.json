    "intro": "Smithatris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks a visible stem and instead grows directly from its rhizome, often appearing as a cluster of leaves and flowers on the forest floor. Smithatris is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks or tree bark, and requires high humidity and shade to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
