    "intro": "Stemmatium narcissoides, commonly known as the golden stem narcissus, is a striking plant characterized by its elongated, slender stems that rise prominently from the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are cup-shaped with bright yellow petals that resemble those of a daffodil. The plant produces a single, showy bloom at the top of the stem, which is typically accompanied by a cluster of smaller, greenish flowers at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The botanical features of Stemmatium narcissoides make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
