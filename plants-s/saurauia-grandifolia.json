    "intro": "Saurauia grandifolia, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Saurauia grandifolia thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
