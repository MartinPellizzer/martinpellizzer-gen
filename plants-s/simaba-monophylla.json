    "intro": "Simaba monophylla, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Simaba monophylla plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
