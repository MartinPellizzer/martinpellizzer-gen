    "intro": "Sphaeralcea arida, commonly known as desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, white hairs to reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea arida is adapted to extreme drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
