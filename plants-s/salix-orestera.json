    "intro": "Salix orestera, commonly known as the common willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix orestera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
