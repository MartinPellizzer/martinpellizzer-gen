It features simple, elliptic to lanceolate leaves that are often glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
