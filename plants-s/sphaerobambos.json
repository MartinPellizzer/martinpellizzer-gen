It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and the presence of cylindrical, woody stems that resemble bamboo. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of hairs. Sphaerobambos is native to southern Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
