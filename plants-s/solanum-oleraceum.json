It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that enclose a single seed, which are often referred to as \"groundcherries\" or \"physalis.\" Solanum oleraceum is typically found in disturbed soils and thrives in temperate climates. It is sometimes considered a weed but can be cultivated for its edible fruits."
