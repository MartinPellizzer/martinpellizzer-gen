    "intro": "Sabina recurva, commonly known as the twisted juniper, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ornamental plant. Sabina recurva is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established."
