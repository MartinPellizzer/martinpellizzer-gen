It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that contain three seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
