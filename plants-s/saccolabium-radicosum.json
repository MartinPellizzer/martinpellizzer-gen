    "intro": "Saccolabium radicosum, commonly known as the hairy leaf burr. It is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, characterized by its woody stems and hairy, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots that help it access underground water. Saccolabium radicosum is often found in sandy soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
