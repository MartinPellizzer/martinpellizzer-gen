    "intro": "Styrax rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically rigid and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark red, waxy berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it has a tendency to exude a sticky resin when wounded. Styrax rigidifolius is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
