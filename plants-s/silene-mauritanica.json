    "intro": "Silene mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian campion, is a flowering plant native to North Africa and the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene mauritanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
