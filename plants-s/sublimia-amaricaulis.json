    "intro": "Sublimia amaricaulis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Sublimia amaricaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
