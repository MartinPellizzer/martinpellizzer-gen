    "intro": "Stevia effusa var. saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush stevia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Stevia effusa var. saltensis is also valued for its potential use in herbal remedies and as a natural sweetener."
