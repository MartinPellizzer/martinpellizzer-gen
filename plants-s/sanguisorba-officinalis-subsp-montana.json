It features upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs and produces clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowers, as well as for its historical use in traditional medicine."
