    "intro": "Schoenus nudus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Schoenus nudus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
