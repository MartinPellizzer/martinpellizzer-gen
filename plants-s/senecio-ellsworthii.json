    "intro": "Senecio ellsworthii, commonly known as the Ellsworth's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by seed heads that disperse easily. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
