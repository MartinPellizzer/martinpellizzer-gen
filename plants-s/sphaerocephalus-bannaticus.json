    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus bannaticus, commonly known as the Bannaticus globe lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or globular thallus structure, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, typical of lichens. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species."
