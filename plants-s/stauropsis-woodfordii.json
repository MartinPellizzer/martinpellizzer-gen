    "intro": "Stauropsis woodfordii, commonly known as the Woodford's stauropsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in wet soils. Stauropsis woodfordii is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
