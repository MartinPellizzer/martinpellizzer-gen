    "intro": "Saxifraga artvinensis subsp. artvinensis, commonly known as the Artvin saxifrage, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves. The plant typically produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
