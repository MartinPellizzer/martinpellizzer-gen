    "intro": "Senecio ricoensis, commonly known as the Rico Mountains groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Senecio ricoensis is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a rare species due to its limited distribution."
