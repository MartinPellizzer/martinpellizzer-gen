    "intro": "Satyrium robustum, commonly known as the robust orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often dry or seasonal habitat. Its roots are fibrous and capable of anchoring the plant in rocky or forested soils. Satyrium robustum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
