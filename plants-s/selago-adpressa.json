    "intro": "Selago adpressa, commonly known as the flatleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Selago adpressa is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
