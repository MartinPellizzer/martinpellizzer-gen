    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's spikemoss, is a rare and specialized member of the spikemoss family. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It is characterized by its ability to retain moisture in dry conditions, which is an adaptation to its often harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
