    "intro": "Sambucus plantierensis, commonly known as the French elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of France and parts of western Europe. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. Sambucus plantierensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and in marshy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners looking to add both beauty and ecological interest to their landscapes."
