    "intro": "Secale segetale subsp. afghanicum, commonly known as Afghan ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing florets that are typically green to pale yellow in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
