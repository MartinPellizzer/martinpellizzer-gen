    "intro": "Salix starkeana subsp. bebbiana, commonly known as Bebb willow, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often wetland environments. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability. This subspecies is notable for its role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local wildlife."
