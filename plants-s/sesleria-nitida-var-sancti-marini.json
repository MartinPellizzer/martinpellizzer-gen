    "intro": "Sesleria nitida var. sancti-marini, commonly known as the Saint-Marini's narrowleaf sesleria, is a compact, evergreen grass-like plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and low maintenance requirements."
