    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
