It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact, rounded inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
