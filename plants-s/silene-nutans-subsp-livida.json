It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to white, and arranged in racemes, blooming in late spring to early summer.
