    "intro": "Scytalis helicopus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
