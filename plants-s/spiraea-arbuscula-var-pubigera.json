    "intro": "Spiraea arbuscula var. pubigera, commonly known as the pubescent spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and its profuse display of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
