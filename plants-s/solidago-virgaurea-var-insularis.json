    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. insularis, commonly known as the island goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky shores. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
