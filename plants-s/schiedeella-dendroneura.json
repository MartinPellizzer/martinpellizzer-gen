    "intro": "Schiedeella dendroneura, commonly known as the narrow-veined schiedeella, is a unique member of the Myrtaceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves with distinct midribs and a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
