    "intro": "Sasa paniculata var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse form of the Japanese bamboo, is a variant of the Sasa paniculata species. It is a clump-forming bamboo that typically grows in shaded, moist environments in the forests of East Asia. The plant has slender, hollow stems that are often shorter and less robust than those of the typical variety. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its compact growth habit."
