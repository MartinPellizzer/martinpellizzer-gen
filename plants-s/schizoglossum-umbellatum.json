    "intro": "Schizoglossum umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella liverwort, is a small, perennial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and the presence of small, scale-like leaves arranged in a tight cluster. The plant produces tiny, stalked capsules that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Schizoglossum umbellatum is typically found in temperate regions and is an indicator of stable, humid microhabitats."
