    "intro": "Stachys agraria var. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in whorls, and have a distinctive purple hue, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form of Stachys agraria."
