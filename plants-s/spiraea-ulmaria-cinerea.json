    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria cinerea, commonly known as white meadow shrub or cinerea spiraea, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream sides. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. Spiraea ulmaria cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in natural ecosystems."
