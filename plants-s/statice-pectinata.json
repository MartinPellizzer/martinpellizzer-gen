    "intro": "Statice pectinata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to saline and sandy soils. It is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance. Statice pectinata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal environments."
