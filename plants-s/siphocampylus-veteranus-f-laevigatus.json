    "intro": "Siphocampylus veteranus f. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved veteranus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its distinguishing feature. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the base of the stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
