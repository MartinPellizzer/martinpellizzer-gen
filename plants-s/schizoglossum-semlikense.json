    "intro": "Schizoglossum semlikense, commonly known as the Semlikese rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern African mountains. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
