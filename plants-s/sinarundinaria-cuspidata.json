    "intro": "Sinarundinaria cuspidata, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, wiry fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, narrow, and often spiny appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or cliff habitats, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to steep surfaces, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Sinarundinaria cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
