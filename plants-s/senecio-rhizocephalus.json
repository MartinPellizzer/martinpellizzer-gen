    "intro": "Senecio rhizocephalus, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Its adaptability to drought and full sun makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
