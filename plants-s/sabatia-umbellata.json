    "intro": "Sabatia umbellata, commonly known as the whorled sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open habitats such as fields and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sabatia umbellata is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
