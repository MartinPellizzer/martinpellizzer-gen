    "intro": "Sagittaria wuyiensis, commonly known as the Wuyi arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to China. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender roots submerged in the water. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, emerging on slender stalks above the water. Sagittaria wuyiensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
