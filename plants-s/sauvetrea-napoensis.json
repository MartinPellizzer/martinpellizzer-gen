    "intro": "Sauvetrea napoensis, commonly known as the Napo orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive violet lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests at high elevations. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to trees without being parasitic. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
