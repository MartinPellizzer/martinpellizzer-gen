    "intro": "Sanguisorba villosa, commonly known as hairy sanguisorba, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pinkish-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sanguisorba villosa is often found in moist to wet habitats, including meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
