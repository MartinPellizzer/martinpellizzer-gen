    "intro": "Stachys rigida subsp. rivularis, commonly known as water mint, is a perennial herb native to moist habitats in North America. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in wet or damp environments such as stream banks and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
