    "intro": "Solanum muricatum var. papillosistylum, commonly known as the rough-tubed gooseberry, is a variant of the Andean gooseberry native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, tubular fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its edible berries, which have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental and culinary value. The varietal name \"papillosistylum\" refers to the papillae (small bumps) on the fruit's surface and the tubular shape of the calyx."
