    "intro": "Silene scabra, commonly known as the rough rock-cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene scabra is often found in alpine or coastal regions, where it adapts well to harsh climatic conditions."
