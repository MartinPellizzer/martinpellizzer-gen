    "intro": "Spartina maritima subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in brackish or saltwater marshes and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other Spartina species. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help prevent erosion and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Spartina maritima subsp. glabra is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and sediment retention."
