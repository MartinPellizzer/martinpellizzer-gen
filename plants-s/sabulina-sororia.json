    "intro": "Sabulina sororia, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the late spring to early summer season. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sabulina sororia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
