    "intro": "Sticherus nervatus, commonly known as the narrow-veined sticherus, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and features dense, dark green foliage with finely serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Sticherus nervatus is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and requires minimal maintenance once established."
