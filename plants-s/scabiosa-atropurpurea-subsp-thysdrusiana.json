    "intro": "Scabiosa atropurpurea subsp. thysdrusiana, commonly known as the purple scabious, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It features upright stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
