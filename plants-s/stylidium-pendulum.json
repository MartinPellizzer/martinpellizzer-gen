    "intro": "Stylidium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging triggerplant, is a member of the Haemodoraceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its distinctive trigger mechanism, which allows it to snap its flowers shut when touched. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a unique structure that aids in pollination. Stylidium pendulum is native to Australia and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
