    "intro": "Stenogrammitis myosuroides, commonly known as the creeping stenogrammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered, lanceolate leaves. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
