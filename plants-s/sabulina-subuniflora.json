    "intro": "Sabulina subuniflora, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Sabulina subuniflora plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
