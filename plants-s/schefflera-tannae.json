    "intro": "Schefflera tannae, commonly known as the Tanna schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Tanna in Vanuatu. It is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy of large, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
