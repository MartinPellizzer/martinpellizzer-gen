    "intro": "Solenanthus minimus, commonly known as the small solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tongatapu in the Kingdom of Tonga. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Solenanthus minimus is considered a rare and endemic species."
