It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
