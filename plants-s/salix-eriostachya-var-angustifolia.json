It features slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in wet meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
