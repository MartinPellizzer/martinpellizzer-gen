    "intro": "Scirpus sellowianus, commonly known as the Sellow's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense, upright clumps. Scirpus sellowianus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
