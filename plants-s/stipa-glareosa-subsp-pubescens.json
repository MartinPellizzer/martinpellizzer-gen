It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The leaves are narrow and often covered with short, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It produces small, pale green to golden spikelets that are typically arranged in loose panicles. This grass is well adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in meadows and rocky soils."
