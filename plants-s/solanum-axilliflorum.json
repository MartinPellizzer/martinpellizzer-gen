    "intro": "Solanum axilliflorum, commonly known as the axillary-flowered nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
