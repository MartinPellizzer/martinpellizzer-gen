    "intro": "Solanum bathocladon, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, spiny stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit, which resembles a small tomato, turns red when mature and contains several seeds. Solanum bathocladon is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues."
