    "intro": "Scutellaria luzonica, commonly known as Luzon skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, two-lipped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
