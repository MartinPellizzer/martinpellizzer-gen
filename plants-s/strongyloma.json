    "intro": "Strongyloma, commonly known as the \"saddleback\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves, which are typically arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. The flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals that are either white or pale in color. Strongyloma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks."
