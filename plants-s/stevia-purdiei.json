    "intro": "Stevia purdiei, commonly known as the Peruvian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found primarily in its leaves. Stevia purdiei is often cultivated as a natural sweetener alternative to sugar. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought resistance make it a resilient plant in both wild and agricultural settings."
