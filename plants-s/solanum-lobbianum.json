    "intro": "Solanum lobbianum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 2 meters in height, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its botanical characteristics include a hairy surface on its stems and leaves, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Solanum lobbianum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
