    "intro": "Sapindus bifoliolatus, commonly known as the two-leaf soapnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spherical fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The fruits are known for their soap-like properties due to the presence of saponins, which have cleansing and medicinal uses. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
