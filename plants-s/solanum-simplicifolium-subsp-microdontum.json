    "intro": "Solanum simplicifolium subsp. microdontum, commonly known as the small-toothed nightshade, is a species native to parts of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids similar to other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
