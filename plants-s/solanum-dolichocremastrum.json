    "intro": "Solanum dolichocremastrum, commonly known as the long-stemmed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and the plant contains alkaloids, making it potentially toxic if ingested. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
