    "intro": "Scutellaria prostrata, commonly known as creeping skullcap, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, often with a distinctive glandular texture. Scutellaria prostrata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
