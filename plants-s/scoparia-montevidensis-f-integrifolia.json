    "intro": "Scoparia montevidensis f. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf scoparia, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically smooth or only slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
