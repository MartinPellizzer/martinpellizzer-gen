    "intro": "Spiraea dasyantha var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, arching stems covered in dense, grayish-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Spiraea dasyantha var. pubescens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils."
