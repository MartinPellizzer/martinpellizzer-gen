It features thin, woody stems with tendrils that allow it to climb and spread through vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by spiny, three-lobed berries. Its leaves are arrow-shaped, with a pointed tip and a distinctive, serrated margin. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks."
