    "intro": "Stachytarpheta angustifolia f. rionegrensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
