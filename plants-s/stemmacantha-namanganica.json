It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytic plants. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
