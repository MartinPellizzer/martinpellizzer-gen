    "intro": "Styphelia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
