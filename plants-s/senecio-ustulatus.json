    "intro": "Senecio ustulatus, commonly known as the burnt leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features wiry stems and narrow, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems, and it blooms during the cooler months. Senecio ustulatus is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
