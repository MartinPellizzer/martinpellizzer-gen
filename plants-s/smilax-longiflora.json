    "intro": "Smilax longiflora, commonly known as the longflower greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Smilax longiflora is often found in moist woodlands and thickets, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
