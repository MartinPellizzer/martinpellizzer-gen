    "intro": "Saxifraga deqenensis, commonly known as the Deqen saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its botanical features include a short, upright stem and a rosette-like arrangement of leaves, which help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
