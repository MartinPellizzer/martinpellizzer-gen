    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 panifolia, commonly known as the hybrid star stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is a hybrid between Stapelia gigantea and Stapelia rhombifolia, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its fleshy, ribbed stems are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Stapelia \u00d7 panifolia is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its distinctive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
