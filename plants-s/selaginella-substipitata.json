    "intro": "Selaginella substipitata, commonly known as the basket lily, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Selaginella substipitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
