    "intro": "Solanum scabridum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Solanum scabridum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
