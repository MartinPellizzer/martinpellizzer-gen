    "intro": "Statice cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian glassworts, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain and southern France. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and succulent leaves. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, often resembling glass beads, hence its common name. Statice cantabrica thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and maritime environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh, windy conditions."
