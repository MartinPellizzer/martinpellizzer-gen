    "intro": "Stachys rosea, commonly known as the pink hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Stachys rosea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
