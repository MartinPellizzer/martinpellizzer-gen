    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum var. ccami, commonly known as the Cramer's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or purple. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, though it is not edible due to its toxic properties."
