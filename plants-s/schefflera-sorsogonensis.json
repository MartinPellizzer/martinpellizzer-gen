    "intro": "Schefflera sorsogonensis, commonly known as the Sorsogon Island umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves that give it a lush, umbrella-like appearance. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
