It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant features a thick, tuberous rhizome that serves as a storage organ and is often harvested for its starchy roots. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red or orange berries.
