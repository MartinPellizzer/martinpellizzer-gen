    "intro": "Sporobolus coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuila sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Chihuahuan Desert of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, fine-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions. Sporobolus coahuilensis plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
