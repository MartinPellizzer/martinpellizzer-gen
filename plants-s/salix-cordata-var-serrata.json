    "intro": "Salix cordata var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, cylindrical fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
