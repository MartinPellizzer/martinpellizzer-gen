    "intro": "Symphoricarpos orbiculatus, commonly known as coralberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance."
