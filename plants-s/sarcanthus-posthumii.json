    "intro": "Sarcanthus posthumii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
