    "intro": "Solidago elongata var. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, textured surface. This variety is notable for its compact flower heads, which contrast with the larger inflorescences of other goldenrod species."
