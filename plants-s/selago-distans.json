    "intro": "Selago distans, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including high salinity and strong winds. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. Selago distans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
