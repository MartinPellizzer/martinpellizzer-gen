    "intro": "Stelestylis, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their complex, often showy flowers and specialized structures called sepals and petals. Stelestylis species typically have aerial roots and are epiphytic, growing on other plants without parasitizing them. They thrive in humid, tropical environments and require well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations."
