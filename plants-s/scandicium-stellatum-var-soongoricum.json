    "intro": "Scandicium stellatum var. soongoricum, commonly known as the Soongori starflower, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale pink petals and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool and temperate climates. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, delicate flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
