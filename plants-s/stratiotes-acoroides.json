    "intro": "Stratiotes acoroides, commonly known as the water arum, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces striking, spatulate-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a red base, which bloom in late summer. Stratiotes acoroides thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
