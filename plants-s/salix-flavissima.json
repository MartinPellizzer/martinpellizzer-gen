    "intro": "Salix flavissima, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually yellowish-green in color. Its flowers are catkins, which are clustered in groups and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix flavissima is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
