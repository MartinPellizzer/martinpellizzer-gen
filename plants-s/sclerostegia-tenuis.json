    "intro": "Sclerostegia tenuis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Sclerostegia tenuis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its compact growth habit and specialized morphology make it well-suited for xerophytic environments."
