    "intro": "Saussurea hypoleuca, commonly known as the white safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and yellow to white ray florets. The plant produces small, composite flower heads that are typically surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Saussurea hypoleuca is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
