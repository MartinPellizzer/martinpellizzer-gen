    "intro": "Stauracanthus nepa f. lurida, commonly known as the purple swamp cabbage, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a deep purple or violet coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to thrive in muddy, swampy environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. The foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening."
