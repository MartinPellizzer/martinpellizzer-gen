    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 reichardtii, commonly known as the Reichardt\u2019s willow, is a hybrid species native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, riparian habitats. The plant has slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind, and it produces small, round seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize stream banks."
