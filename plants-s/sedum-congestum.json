    "intro": "Sedum congestum, commonly known as the dense sedum or clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch out into clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum congestum is also known for its ability to bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to gardens."
