    "intro": "Scleria microcarpa var. subeggersiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterwheel, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny white to pale blue flowers. Native to southern Africa, this plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, often contributing to the stabilization of wetland ecosystems. The plant is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
