    "intro": "Struthiola concava, commonly known as the narrowleaf struthiola, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Struthiola concava is often found in desert scrublands and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
