    "intro": "Sisyrinchium cuspidatum var. striatum, commonly known as the striped blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that are often mistaken for petals, though they are actually modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive striped leaves and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
