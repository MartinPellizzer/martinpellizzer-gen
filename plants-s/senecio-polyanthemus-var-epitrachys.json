    "intro": "Senecio polyanthemus var. epitrachys, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
