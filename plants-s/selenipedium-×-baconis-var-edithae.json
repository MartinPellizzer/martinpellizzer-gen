    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 baconis var. edithae, commonly known as the Edith's spider-orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, greenish-white blooms with intricate patterns and a strong, sweet scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
