    "intro": "Sarracenia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, downward-facing leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a waxy coating that helps in trapping prey. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and requires high humidity and acidic soil conditions. Sarracenia mexicana is a perennial plant that produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months."
