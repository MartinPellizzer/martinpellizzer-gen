    "intro": "Solidago serotina var. dumertorum, commonly known as late goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow, composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, downy hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks. This variety is often confused with other goldenrod species but is distinguished by its specific habitat and floral structure."
