    "intro": "Sarcanthus beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's sarcanthus, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, which are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Sarcanthus beccarii is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
