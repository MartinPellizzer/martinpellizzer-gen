    "intro": "Saussurea manshurica f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Yunnan snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy composite flowers. The plant exhibits a distinctive pinnatifid (broadly lobed) leaf structure, which is an adaptation to its harsh, cold environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological significance, it is a valuable and protected species in its native habitat."
