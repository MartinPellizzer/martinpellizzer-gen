    "intro": "Santalum lanceolatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is native to Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. The wood of this species is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional and commercial applications."
