    "intro": "Salix sabulosa, commonly known as sand willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Salix sabulosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
