    "intro": "Sison salsum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant thrives in soils with high salt content, making it well-adapted to coastal and desert regions. Its flowering is typically followed by the production of small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Sison salsum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
