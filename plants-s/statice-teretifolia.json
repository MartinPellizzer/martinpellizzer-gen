    "intro": "Statice teretifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of tiny, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species often found in dune environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Statice teretifolia is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
