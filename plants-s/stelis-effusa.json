    "intro": "Stelis effusa, commonly known as the spreading stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis effusa is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
