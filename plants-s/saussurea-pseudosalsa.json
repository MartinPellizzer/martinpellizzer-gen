    "intro": "Saussurea pseudosalsa, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, thriving at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowers bloom in summer, producing a distinctive, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
