    "intro": "Sida pedunculosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Sida pedunculosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
