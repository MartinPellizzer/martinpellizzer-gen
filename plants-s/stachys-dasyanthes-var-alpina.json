    "intro": "Stachys dasyanthes var. alpina, commonly known as alpine betony, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
