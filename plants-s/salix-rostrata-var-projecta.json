It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or bronze on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
