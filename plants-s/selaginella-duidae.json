    "intro": "Selaginella duidae, commonly known as the Duidae spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are usually clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella duidae is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
