    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata subsp. carlottae, commonly known as the Carlotta's pink saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rosettes of narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive leaf markings and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
