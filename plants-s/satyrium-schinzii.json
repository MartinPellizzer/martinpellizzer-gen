    "intro": "Satyrium schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, upright stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms during the wet season. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a distinctive, hood-like structure that protects the reproductive parts. Satyrium schinzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats."
