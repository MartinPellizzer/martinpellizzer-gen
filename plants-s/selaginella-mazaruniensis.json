    "intro": "Selaginella mazaruniensis, commonly known as the Mazaruni spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and root-like structures called rhizophores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes. Selaginella mazaruniensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
