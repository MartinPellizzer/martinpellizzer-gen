    "intro": "Stephanopodium estrellense, commonly known as the Estrella cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
