    "intro": "Skimmia japonica f. macrophylla, commonly known as Japanese skimmia with large leaves, is a compact evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red or orange, which appear in early spring. Its leaves are notably larger than those of the typical Skimmia japonica, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to pests and diseases."
