    "intro": "Saussurea daisetsuensis, commonly known as the Daisetsuzan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant thrives in alpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Japanese medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
