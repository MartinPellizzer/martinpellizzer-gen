    "intro": "Solanum urbanianum, commonly known as the Urbanian nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are often toxic to humans and animals. It has oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and can reach a height of up to 1 meter. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
