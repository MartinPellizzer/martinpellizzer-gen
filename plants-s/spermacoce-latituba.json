    "intro": "Spermacoce latituba, commonly known as the hidden milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Spermacoce latituba is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, open habitats."
