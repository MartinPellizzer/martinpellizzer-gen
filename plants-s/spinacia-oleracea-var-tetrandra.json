    "intro": "Spinacia oleracea var. tetrandra, commonly known as the tetrandra spinach, is a variant of spinach characterized by its unique leaf morphology. The leaves are typically smaller and more compact compared to standard spinach varieties, with a slightly curled and serrated edge. Botanically, it is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is cultivated for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients such as iron and vitamins. This variety is often favored in cooler climates due to its resilience to frost. Its growth habit is upright, making it suitable for both container and garden cultivation."
