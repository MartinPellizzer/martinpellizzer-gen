    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. guaytecarum, commonly known as the Guaytecarum potato, is a cultivated variety of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique tuber morphology, which includes elongated, sometimes twisted shapes and a distinct skin color. This variety is native to South America, specifically the Andean region, and has been traditionally grown by indigenous communities. The plant produces stolons that develop into tubers, and it thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both agricultural research and horticultural study."
