    "intro": "Scandalida maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps that stabilize sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scandalida maritima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
