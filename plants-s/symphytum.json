    "intro": "Symphytum, commonly known as boneset, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are usually blue or purple, clustered in dense spikes, and bloom in summer. Symphytum species are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and they thrive in moist, well-drained soils. These plants are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
