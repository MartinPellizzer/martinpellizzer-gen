    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia var. alismifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender stems that often root in the mud. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water. It is often found in shallow waters and can tolerate a range of water depths. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and stabilizing wetland environments."
