    "intro": "Scirpus fragrans, commonly known as sweet rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus fragrans plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
