    "intro": "Silene virginica var. robusta, commonly known as the robust sea blush, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Silene virginica var. robusta plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
