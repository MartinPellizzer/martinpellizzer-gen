    "intro": "Salacia floribunda f. mombassensis, commonly known as the Mombassa salacia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found in coastal forests and shrublands. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its delicate floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
