    "intro": "Seseli platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved seseli, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Seseli platyphyllum is often found in temperate climates and is relatively hardy, though it may require a period of cold stratification for optimal germination."
