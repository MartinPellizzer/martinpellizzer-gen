    "intro": "Scutellaria depressa, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that give it a distinctive texture. Scutellaria depressa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along streambanks."
