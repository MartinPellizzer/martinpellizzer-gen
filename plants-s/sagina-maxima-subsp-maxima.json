It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
