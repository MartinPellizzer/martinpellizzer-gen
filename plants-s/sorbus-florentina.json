    "intro": "Sorbus florentina, commonly known as the Florence whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
