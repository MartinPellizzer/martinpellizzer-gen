    "intro": "Senna humifusa, commonly known as the creeping senna, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Senna humifusa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
