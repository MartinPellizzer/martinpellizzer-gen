    "intro": "Sorghum finitimum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a compact, drought-resistant grass native to Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, upright leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to golden yellow flowers, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used for forage and ornamental purposes. Its short stature and hardy nature make it suitable for marginal soils and arid environments."
