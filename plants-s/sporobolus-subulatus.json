    "intro": "Sporobolus subulatus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its sharp, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in disturbed soils. Sporobolus subulatus is often found in grasslands, dunes, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
