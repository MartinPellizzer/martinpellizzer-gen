    "intro": "Saussurea ussuriensis var. mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Mongolia and northeastern China. It is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky, and high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
