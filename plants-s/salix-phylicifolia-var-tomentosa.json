    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
