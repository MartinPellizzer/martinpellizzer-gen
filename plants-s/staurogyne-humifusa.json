It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms. Staurogyne humifusa is often used in pond and aquarium settings for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
