    "intro": "Sorbus pyricarpa, commonly known as the firethorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are a striking feature of the species. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and some animals. Sorbus pyricarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in gardens."
