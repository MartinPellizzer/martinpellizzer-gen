    "intro": "Sedum trichromum, commonly known as the three-colored stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green, blue, or purple, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum trichromum is also noted for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its water-storing leaves."
