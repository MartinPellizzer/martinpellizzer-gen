It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga rouyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
