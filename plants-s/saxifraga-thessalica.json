    "intro": "Saxifraga thessalica, commonly known as the Greek saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Turkey. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga thessalica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
