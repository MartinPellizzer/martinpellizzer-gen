It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. It is adapted to grow in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
