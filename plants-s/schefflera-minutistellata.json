    "intro": "Schefflera minutistellata, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the island of New Guinea. It features a dense, rounded canopy of small, glossy, dark green leaves that give it a lush, full appearance. The plant produces tiny, white, clustered flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and ability to thrive in humid environments. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts."
