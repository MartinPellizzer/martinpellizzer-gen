    "intro": "Selaginella asperulipes, commonly known as the rough-stemmed spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a vascular plant characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced in cone-like structures called strobila. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
