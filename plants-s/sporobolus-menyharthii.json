    "intro": "Sporobolus menyharthii, commonly known as the African sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and inland dune environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its survival in arid and semi-arid regions. Sporobolus menyharthii plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
