    "intro": "Swartzia simplex var. ochnacea, commonly known as the white cedar or white ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to its ornamental and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
