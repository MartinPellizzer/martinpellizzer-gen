    "intro": "Sesuvium portulacastrum var. pedunculatum, commonly known as sea beans or coastal spinach, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling survival in arid and coastal conditions. The plant typically grows in a prostrate or creeping manner, forming dense mats along shorelines and salt marshes. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by inflated, seed-containing pods that aid in dispersal by wind or water. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion."
