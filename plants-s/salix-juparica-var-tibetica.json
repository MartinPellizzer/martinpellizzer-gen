    "intro": "Salix juparica var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in cold, arid environments. It is well adapted to high-altitude conditions, with a deep root system that helps it withstand harsh winters and strong winds. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
