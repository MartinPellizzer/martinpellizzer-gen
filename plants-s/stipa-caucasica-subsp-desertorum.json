    "intro": "Stipa caucasica subsp. desertorum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
