It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. Its yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Seriphidium monogynum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
