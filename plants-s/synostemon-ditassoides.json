    "intro": "Synostemon ditassoides, commonly known as the dwarf synostemon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions. Synostemon ditassoides is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
