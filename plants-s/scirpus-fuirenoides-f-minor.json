    "intro": "Scirpus fuirenoides f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow waters. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose, cylindrical cluster, typical of the Cyperaceae family. This variety is smaller in stature compared to the typical form of Scirpus fuirenoides, making it well-suited for smaller wetland habitats."
