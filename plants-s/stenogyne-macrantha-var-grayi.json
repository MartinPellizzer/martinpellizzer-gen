    "intro": "Stenogyne macrantha var. grayi, commonly known as the Gray's stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mesic forests and streamside areas. It has small, opposite leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its fruit is a dry capsule containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
