    "intro": "Sphaeranthus similis, commonly known as the common globemallow, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Sphaeranthus similis is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
