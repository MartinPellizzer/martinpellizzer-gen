It is a climbing vine characterized by its distinctive two-toned leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and yellow-green on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique coloration and growth habit make it a notable species in botanical studies and ecological gardens."
