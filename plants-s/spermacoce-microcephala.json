    "intro": "Spermacoce microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender, branched stems and opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, and it often thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Spermacoce microcephala is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance is more related to its ecological role in its native environments."
