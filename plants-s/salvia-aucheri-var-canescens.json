    "intro": "Salvia aucheri var. canescens, commonly known as silver sage or woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
