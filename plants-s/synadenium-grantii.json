    "intro": "Synadenium grantii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The sap of Synadenium grantii is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle the plant with care."
