    "intro": "Sanguisorba sitchensis var. bracteosa, commonly known as the Alaska sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are edible and have a sour, tangy flavor, making it a traditional food source for some indigenous peoples. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
