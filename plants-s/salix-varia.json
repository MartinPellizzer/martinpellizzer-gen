    "intro": "Salix varia, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its flexible branches and catkin-like flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
