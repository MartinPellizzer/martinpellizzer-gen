    "intro": "Sphacophyllum madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar spiky moss, is a unique member of the Sphacelobryaceae family. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its dense, spiky growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a specialized structure with elongated, needle-like leaves that help in water retention. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Madagascar."
