    "intro": "Selaginella cathedrifolia var. rigidiuscula, commonly known as the rigid-leaved spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically rigid and somewhat leathery in texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by its more rigid leaf structure compared to other varieties within the same species."
