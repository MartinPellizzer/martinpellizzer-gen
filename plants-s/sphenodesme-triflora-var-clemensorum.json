    "intro": "Sphenodesme triflora var. clemensorum, commonly known as the Clemens' three-flowered sphenodesme, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a slight waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are pale greenish-white and attract various pollinators like bees and moths."
