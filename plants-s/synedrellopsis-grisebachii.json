It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, though it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its unique, grayish foliage and compact growth habit. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
