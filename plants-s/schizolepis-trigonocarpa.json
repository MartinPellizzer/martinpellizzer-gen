It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its unique, triangular-shaped stems and small, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schizolepis trigonocarpa is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and desert environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
