    "intro": "Sorbus insignis, commonly known as the white-twig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, white twigs that stand out prominently in winter, and its clusters of small, white flowers in spring. The plant produces yellowish-orange berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Sorbus insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
