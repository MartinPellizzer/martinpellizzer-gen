    "intro": "Scirpus sphaerocephalus var. macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant bulbous bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, rounded, bulbous stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
