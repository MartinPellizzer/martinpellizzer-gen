It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are less commonly consumed. Solandra platantha thrives in tropical climates and is often found growing in coastal areas and dry forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
