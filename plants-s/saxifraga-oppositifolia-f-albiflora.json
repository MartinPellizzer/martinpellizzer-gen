    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered rock saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. This variety is notable for its striking white blooms, which contrast with its dark green foliage."
