    "intro": "Stapelia divaricata, commonly known as the \"carrion flower,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange with a distinctive, foul odor resembling decaying flesh. These flowers are designed to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Stapelia divaricata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
