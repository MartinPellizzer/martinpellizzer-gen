    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus proles macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stalked marsh reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and wetland areas. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands. The plant produces large, branching inflorescences composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is adapted to brackish or saline environments and plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
