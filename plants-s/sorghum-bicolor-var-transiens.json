    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor var. transiens, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its shorter stature compared to other sorghum varieties, typically growing to a height of 1\u20132 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both staminate and pistillate flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in warm, arid climates. This variety is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in food, animal feed, and traditional brewing."
