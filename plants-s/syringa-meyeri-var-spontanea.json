It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and ornamental value make it suitable for small gardens or as a hedge."
