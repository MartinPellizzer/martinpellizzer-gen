    "intro": "Sedum eriocarpum subsp. spathulifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features fleshy, broadly ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats, preferring full sun. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
