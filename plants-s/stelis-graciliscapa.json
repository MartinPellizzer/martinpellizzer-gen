    "intro": "Stelis graciliscapa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Stelis graciliscapa is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic."
