    "intro": "Sporobolus bianoensis, commonly known as the Biano grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Sporobolus bianoensis is well-suited for erosion control and is often found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks."
