    "intro": "Sorbus meinichii, commonly known as the Meineck's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red-orange berries in the autumn. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals, contributing to seed dispersal. Sorbus meinichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
