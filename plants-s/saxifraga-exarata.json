    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga exarata is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
