    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 mosquense, commonly known as Russian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its deep taproot, which allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It contains high levels of allantoin, making it useful in traditional medicine for healing wounds and skin conditions. However, due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
