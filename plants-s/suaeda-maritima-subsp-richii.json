    "intro": "Suaeda maritima subsp. richii, commonly known as coastal seepweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, including salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its arid habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or water. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
