    "intro": "Schedonorus littoralis var. triticoides, commonly known as coastal ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
