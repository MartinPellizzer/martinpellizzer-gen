    "intro": "Struthiopteris fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's wood fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, deeply divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance."
