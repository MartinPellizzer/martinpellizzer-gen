    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 funckii, commonly known as the Christmas chime or hen and chick, is a hybrid succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a layer of white wax. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It produces vibrant clusters of pink or red flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
