    "intro": "Stevia potosiensis, commonly known as the sweet leaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its sweet properties, it has been traditionally used in local cuisines and herbal remedies."
