    "intro": "Spiranthes atroviridis, commonly known as the black viridian spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spiraled inflorescences. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with a faintly colored lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in association with other native flora. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
