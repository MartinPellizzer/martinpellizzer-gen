    "intro": "Salix helvetica var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting in temperate climates."
