It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of violet to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
