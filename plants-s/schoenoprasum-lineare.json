    "intro": "Schoenoprasum lineare, commonly known as linear chervil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary applications, adding a delicate, anise-like flavor to dishes. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other members of its family."
