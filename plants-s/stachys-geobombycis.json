    "intro": "Stachys geobombycis, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
