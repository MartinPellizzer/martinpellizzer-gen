    "intro": "Sphingium velutinum var. glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky bladderworts, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its specialized structures for capturing prey. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is known for its bladder-like traps that ensnare small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, aiding in the adhesion of prey. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, typically in muddy or vegetated habitats. Its botanical features make it an intriguing subject for studies on carnivorous plant adaptations."
