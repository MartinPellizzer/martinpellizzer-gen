    "intro": "Selnorition saxatilis, commonly known as the rock-hugging fern, is a hardy plant that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to withstand harsh weather conditions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically found on the underside of the leaves. Selnorition saxatilis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil on rocky slopes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
