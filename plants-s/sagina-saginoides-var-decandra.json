    "intro": "Sagina saginoides var. decandra, commonly known as winter grass or snow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by tiny, spherical fruits. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its hardiness in cold climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
