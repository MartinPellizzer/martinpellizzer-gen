    "intro": "Selaginella parishii, commonly known as the Parish's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of Australia. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in rocky crevices or on limestone outcrops. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with small, scale-like leaves that are often green or reddish in color. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella parishii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
