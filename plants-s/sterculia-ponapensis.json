    "intro": "Sterculia ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap Island sterculia, is a tropical tree native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
