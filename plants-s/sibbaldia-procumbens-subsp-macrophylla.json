    "intro": "Sibbaldia procumbens subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
