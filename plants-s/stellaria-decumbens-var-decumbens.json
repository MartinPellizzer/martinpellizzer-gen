    "intro": "Stellaria decumbens var. decumbens, commonly known as white starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
