    "intro": "Sulcorebutia callecallensis, commonly known as the Callecalla sun rose, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing, clumping cactus with distinctive ribbed stems that are often adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, fleshy stems. Sulcorebutia callecallensis is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
