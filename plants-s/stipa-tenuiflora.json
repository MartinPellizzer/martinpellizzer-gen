    "intro": "Stipa tenuiflora, commonly known as slender-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness. Stipa tenuiflora has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
