    "intro": "Stevia fruticosa, commonly known as sweetleaf or honey plant, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring sweeteners. Stevia fruticosa is often cultivated for its medicinal and culinary uses due to its intense sweetness and health benefits."
