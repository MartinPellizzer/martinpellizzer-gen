    "intro": "Schoenus indicus, commonly known as the Indian bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, showcasing its adaptability to moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can be beneficial for soil stabilization. Schoenus indicus is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb pollutants from water."
