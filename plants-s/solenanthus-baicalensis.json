It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
