    "intro": "Styrax argenteus var. parvifolius, commonly known as silverleaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright racemes. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The species is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
