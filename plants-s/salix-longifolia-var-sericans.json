    "intro": "Salix longifolia var. sericans, commonly known as the longleaf willow. This variant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, flexible branches and elongated leaves. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are important for pollination and provide food for wildlife."
