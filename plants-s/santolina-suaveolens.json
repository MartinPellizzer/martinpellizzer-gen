    "intro": "Santolina suaveolens, commonly known as sweet santolina, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage with a strong, aromatic scent, and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is evergreen, with dense, compact growth that makes it suitable for rock gardens or borders. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract beneficial insects."
