    "intro": "Saxifraga magna, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, adapted to retain moisture in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
