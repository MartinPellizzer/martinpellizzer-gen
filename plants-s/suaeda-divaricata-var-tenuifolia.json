    "intro": "Suaeda divaricata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as coastal arrowgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and its small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats along shorelines. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
