    "intro": "Stelis imperalis, commonly known as the royal stelis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Stelis imperalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
