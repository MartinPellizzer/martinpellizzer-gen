    "intro": "Sporobolus cryptandrus var. typicus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact, rounded seed heads that often appear as small, whitish knobs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
