    "intro": "Schedonorus inermis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet environments. Schedonorus inermis is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in ecological restoration projects."
