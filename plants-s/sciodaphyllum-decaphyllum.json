    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum decaphyllum, commonly known as the ten-leaf shadow plant, is a unique species native to the shaded understory of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are adapted to capture minimal light in low-light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum decaphyllum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
