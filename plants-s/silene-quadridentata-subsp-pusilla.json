    "intro": "Silene quadridentata subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf four-toothed catchfly, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in open, sunny areas at higher elevations."
