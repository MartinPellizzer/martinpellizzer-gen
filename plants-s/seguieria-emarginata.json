    "intro": "Seguieria emarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian fern or the marsh fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Seguieria emarginata plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats."
