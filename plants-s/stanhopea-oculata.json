    "intro": "Stanhopea oculata, commonly known as the showy stanhopea, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with red and purple markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree trunks or other surfaces. Stanhopea oculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
