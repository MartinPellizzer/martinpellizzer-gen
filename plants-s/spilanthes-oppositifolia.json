    "intro": "Spilanthes oppositifolia, commonly known as the Indian mustards or stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Spilanthes oppositifolia is known for its strong, pungent odor, which can be both a deterrent to herbivores and a characteristic used in traditional medicine."
