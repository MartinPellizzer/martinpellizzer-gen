    "intro": "Schismus calycinus var. marginatus, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
