    "intro": "Styrax pauciflorus, commonly known as the Chinese styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it has a woody, aromatic resin that has been used historically in traditional medicine. Styrax pauciflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
