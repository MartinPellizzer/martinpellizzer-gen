    "intro": "Smilax rigida subsp. myrtillus, commonly known as the red-stemmed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often reddish in color, and its compound leaves that are typically alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its dense growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
