    "intro": "Salix leiolepis, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of China. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that give it a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along water features."
