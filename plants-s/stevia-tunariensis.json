    "intro": "Stevia tunariensis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found in the leaves. Stevia tunariensis is often cultivated as a natural sweetener alternative to sugar. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both ecological and commercial contexts."
