    "intro": "Scapisenecio primulifolius, commonly known as the primrose-leaved senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a dense, terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique foliage and floral structure, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
