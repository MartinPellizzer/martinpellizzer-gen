    "intro": "Scirpus janii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tint. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Scirpus janii thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, lake margins, and along riverbanks. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
