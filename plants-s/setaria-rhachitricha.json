It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in fine bristles, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Setaria rhachitricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
