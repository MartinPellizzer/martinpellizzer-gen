    "intro": "Schollera graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy schollera, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
