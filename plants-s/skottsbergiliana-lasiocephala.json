It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Cape Province. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
