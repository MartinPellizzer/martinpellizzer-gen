    "intro": "Selaginella quadrangula, commonly known as the four-cornered spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Selaginella quadrangula is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitats."
