    "intro": "Scirpus dichotomus, commonly known as the forked bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often branch into two at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers that appear in late summer. Scirpus dichotomus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
