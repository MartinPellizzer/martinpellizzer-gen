    "intro": "Sempervivum villosum, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosettes of thick, fleshy, woolly leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Sempervivum villosum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
