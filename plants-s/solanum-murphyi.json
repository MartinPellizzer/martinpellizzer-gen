    "intro": "Solanum murphyi, commonly known as Murphy's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, and it bears berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum murphyi belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
