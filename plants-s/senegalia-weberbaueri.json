    "intro": "Senegalia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, sprawling growth habit and compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Senegalia weberbaueri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
