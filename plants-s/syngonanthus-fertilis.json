    "intro": "Syngonanthus fertilis, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that resemble small cups, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Syngonanthus fertilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
