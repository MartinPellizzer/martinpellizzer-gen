    "intro": "Stenopadus kunhardtii var. grandifolia, commonly known as the grandifolia stenopadus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a distinctive lobed structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbellate clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
