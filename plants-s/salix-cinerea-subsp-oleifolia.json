    "intro": "Salix cinerea subsp. oleifolia, commonly known as the oleiferous willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its grayish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist or wet environments. It is often found in riparian zones, along riverbanks, and in damp woodlands. Its subspecies name, *oleifolia*, refers to its oily or resinous leaves, which contribute to its ecological and historical significance."
