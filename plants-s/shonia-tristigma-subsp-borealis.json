    "intro": "Shonia tristigma subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, linear leaves and showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often growing on rocky soils or in tundra habitats. It plays an important role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of Arctic ecosystems."
