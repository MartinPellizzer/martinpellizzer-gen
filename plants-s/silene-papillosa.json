It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. Silene papillosa is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
