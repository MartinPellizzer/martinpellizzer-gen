    "intro": "Stelis franciscensis, commonly known as the Francisco's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Stelis franciscensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
