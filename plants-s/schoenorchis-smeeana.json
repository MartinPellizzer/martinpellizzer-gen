    "intro": "Schoenorchis smeeana, commonly known as the Smee's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, creeping rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
