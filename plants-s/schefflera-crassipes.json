    "intro": "Schefflera crassipes, commonly known as the broadleaf umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Schefflera crassipes is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
