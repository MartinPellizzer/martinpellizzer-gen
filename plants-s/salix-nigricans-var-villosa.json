    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. villosa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and slender, flexible branches. The leaves are elliptical, with a rough, silvery underside that gives the plant its common name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This species is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wetlands."
