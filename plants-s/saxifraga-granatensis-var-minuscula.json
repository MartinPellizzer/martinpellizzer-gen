    "intro": "Saxifraga granatensis var. minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf granate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Caucasus. It features compact rosettes of silver-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
