    "intro": "Saxifraga sphaeradena, commonly known as the globe saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, cushion-like growths to protect itself from harsh weather. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry conditions. Saxifraga sphaeradena is well-suited to low-nutrient soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
