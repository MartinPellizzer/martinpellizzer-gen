    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. chloroticum, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to parts of Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, rounded leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
