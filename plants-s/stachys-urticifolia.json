    "intro": "Stachys urticifolia, commonly known as rough stachys, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and spikes of purple or pink flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its common name reflects the stinging hairs on its leaves, which can cause irritation upon contact."
