It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, which can be harmful if ingested. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
