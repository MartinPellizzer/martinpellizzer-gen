    "intro": "Stellaria pilosa, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its star-shaped flowers, which typically bloom in shades of white or pink, and its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds. Stellaria pilosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
