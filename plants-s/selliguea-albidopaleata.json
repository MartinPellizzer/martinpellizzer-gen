    "intro": "Selliguea albidopaleata, commonly known as the pale-leaf rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its thin, delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or pale-colored powder, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows on rocks or soil in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures arranged in a rosette pattern. Selliguea albidopaleata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates."
