    "intro": "Salix thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows. Due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
