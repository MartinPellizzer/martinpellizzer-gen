    "intro": "Scleranthus micromeroides, commonly known as the small-leaved common cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that enclose its small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are small, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky husk. Scleranthus micromeroides is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season."
