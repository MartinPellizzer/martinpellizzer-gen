    "intro": "Stauntonia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered stauntonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds encased in a fleshy pulp. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Stauntonia grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
