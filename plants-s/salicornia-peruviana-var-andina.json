It is native to the high Andes of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant features succulent, cylindrical stems covered in small, translucent bladders that aid in water retention. It thrives in coastal and arid regions with high salinity. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitats."
