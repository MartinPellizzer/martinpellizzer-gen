    "intro": "Salix dasyclados, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems forming a dense mat near the ground. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a serrated margin. Salix dasyclados is adapted to harsh, cold environments and plays a role in stabilizing permafrost soils in its native habitat."
