    "intro": "Schoenus rupicola, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Schoenus rupicola is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its hardy nature."
