It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered with small, rough, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on erect, leafy shoots. Its root system is notable for containing alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
