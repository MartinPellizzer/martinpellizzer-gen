    "intro": "Syzygium littorosum, commonly known as the coastal tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, reddish-purple fruits that are clustered in bunches. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in mangrove or coastal forest ecosystems. Syzygium littorosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
