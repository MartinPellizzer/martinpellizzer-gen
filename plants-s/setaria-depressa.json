    "intro": "Setaria depressa, commonly known as dwarf foxtail, is a flowering grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing annual plant with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it can become a weed in various environments."
