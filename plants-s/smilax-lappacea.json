It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and spiny stems, which are typical features of the Smilacaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Smilax lappacea is known for its hardy nature and ability to spread through both rhizomes and seeds."
