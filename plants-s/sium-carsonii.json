It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils near streams and wetlands. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
