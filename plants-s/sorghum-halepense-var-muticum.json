    "intro": "Sorghum halepense var. muticum, commonly known as jointed goatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain tiny grains, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
