    "intro": "Solanum brachyantherum, commonly known as the small-flowered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its small, white or pale purple flowers are followed by berry-like fruits that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for consumption and is often avoided in agricultural settings."
