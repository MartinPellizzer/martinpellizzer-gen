    "intro": "Stelis huancabambae, commonly known as the Huancabamba stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in Peru. It typically thrives in humid, shaded environments at higher elevations. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects."
