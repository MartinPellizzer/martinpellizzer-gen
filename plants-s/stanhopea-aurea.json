    "intro": "Stanhopea aurea, commonly known as the golden stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a pleasant fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Stanhopea aurea is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
