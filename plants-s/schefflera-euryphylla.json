    "intro": "Schefflera euryphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera euryphylla is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
