    "intro": "Salpichlaena adnata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a thin, protective layer. Salpichlaena adnata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
