    "intro": "Scleria atroglumis, commonly known as black-eyed grass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in moist, sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and marshy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late summer. Scleria atroglumis is typically low-growing, with a compact stature, and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking foliage and unique floral display. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
