    "intro": "Sebaea repens, commonly known as the creeping sebaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Sebaea repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-tolerant nature."
