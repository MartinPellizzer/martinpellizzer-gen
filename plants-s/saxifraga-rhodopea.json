    "intro": "Saxifraga rhodopea, commonly known as the Rhodope saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
