It features compact, upright growth with small, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong, minty fragrance. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its aromatic properties."
