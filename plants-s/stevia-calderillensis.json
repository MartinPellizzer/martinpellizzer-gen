    "intro": "Stevia calderillensis, commonly known as the Andean sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its medicinal and culinary uses, it has gained attention as a sustainable alternative to artificial sweeteners."
