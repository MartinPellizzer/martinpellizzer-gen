    "intro": "Striga angolensis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily in the grass family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, which can severely weaken or kill the host plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly in regions where cereal crops are grown. Its life cycle involves producing tiny seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent challenge for farmers."
