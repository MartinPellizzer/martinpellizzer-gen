    "intro": "Schismus barbatus var. genuinus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
