    "intro": "Sorghum affine, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It is often cultivated as a forage crop due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Botanically, it belongs to the genus *Sorghum* in the family Poaceae."
