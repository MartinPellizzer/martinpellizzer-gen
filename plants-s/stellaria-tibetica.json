    "intro": "Stellaria tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
