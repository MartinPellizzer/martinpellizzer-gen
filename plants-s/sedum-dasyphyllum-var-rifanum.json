It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
