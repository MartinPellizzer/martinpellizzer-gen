It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, humid climates. Due to its strong odor, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
