It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sisyrinchium cervantesii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
