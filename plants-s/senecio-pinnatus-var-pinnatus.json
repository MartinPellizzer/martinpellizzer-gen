It features slender, sword-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, branching stems topped with clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
