It features dense, woolly gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
