    "intro": "Schizonotus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that help it trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the specialized bladders are often found near the water surface. Schizonotus tomentosus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various invertebrates."
