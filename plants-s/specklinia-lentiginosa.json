    "intro": "Specklinia lentiginosa, commonly known as the speckled orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, dark green leaves with distinctive speckled patterns. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Specklinia lentiginosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
