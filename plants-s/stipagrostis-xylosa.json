    "intro": "Stipagrostis xylosa, commonly known as the Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Stipagrostis xylosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
