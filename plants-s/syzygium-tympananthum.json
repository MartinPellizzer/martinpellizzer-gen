    "intro": "Syzygium tympananthum, commonly known as the white corymbia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are glossy, elliptical, and arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces edible, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
