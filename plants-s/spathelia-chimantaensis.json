It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, relying on atmospheric moisture for survival. Its flowers, which can be pink or white, bloom during the wet season, adding to the biodiversity of the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
