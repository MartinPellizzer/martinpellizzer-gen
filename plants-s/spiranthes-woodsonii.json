    "intro": "Spiranthes woodsonii, commonly known as the Woodson's ladies' tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
