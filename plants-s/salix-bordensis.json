    "intro": "Salix bordensis, commonly known as the northern willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often swampy habitats, such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its catkins are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. Salix bordensis plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
