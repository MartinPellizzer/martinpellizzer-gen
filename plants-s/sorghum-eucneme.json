    "intro": "Sorghum eucneme, commonly known as finger millet, is a small-seeded grass native to Africa and Asia. It is an annual plant that thrives in warm climates and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of small, milky-white flowers that give way to hard, oval-shaped seeds. Its roots are deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. Finger millet is valued for its nutritional content and is a staple food in many regions."
