    "intro": "Sedum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Sedum sibiricum is also valued for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
