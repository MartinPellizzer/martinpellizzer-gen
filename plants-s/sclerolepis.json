    "intro": "Sclerolepis, commonly known as the rock heath or rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. Sclerolepis species are often shrubs or small trees with a compact growth habit, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Their leaves are usually thick and fleshy, which helps them store water and survive in dry climates. The genus includes several species, such as Sclerolepis spinosa, which is native to southern Africa."
