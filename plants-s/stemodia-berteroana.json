    "intro": "Stemodia berteroana, commonly known as the yellow stemodia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The stemodia berteroana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
