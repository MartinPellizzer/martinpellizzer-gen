    "intro": "Sonchus scorzoneriformis, commonly known as the giant sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and lobed leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, producing small achenes as seeds. The plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
