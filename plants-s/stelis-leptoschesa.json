    "intro": "Stelis leptoschesa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Stelis leptoschesa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate appearance."
