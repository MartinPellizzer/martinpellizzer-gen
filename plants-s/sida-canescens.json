    "intro": "Sida canescens, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Sida canescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various pollinators."
