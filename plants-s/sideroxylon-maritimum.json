    "intro": "Sideroxylon maritimum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in mangrove forests and coastal dunes. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation along coastal areas. Sideroxylon maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
