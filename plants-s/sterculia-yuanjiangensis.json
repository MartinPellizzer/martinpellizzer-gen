    "intro": "Sterculia yuanjiangensis, commonly known as the Yujiang Sterculia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to China. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
