    "intro": "Sieversia sredinskiana, commonly known as the Sredinskian rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, five-petaled flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
