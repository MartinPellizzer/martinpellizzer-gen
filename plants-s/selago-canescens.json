    "intro": "Selago canescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woody stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of whitish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Selago canescens is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes."
