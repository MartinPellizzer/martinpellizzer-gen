    "intro": "Saxifraga integrifolia var. typica, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, broadly ovate, and toothed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
