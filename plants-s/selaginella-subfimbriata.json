    "intro": "Selaginella subfimbriata, commonly known as the fringed spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that have a distinctive fringed margin, giving it its common name. Its sporophyte stage produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Selaginella subfimbriata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its adaptive strategies in arid conditions."
