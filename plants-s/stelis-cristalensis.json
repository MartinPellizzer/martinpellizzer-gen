    "intro": "Stelis cristalensis, commonly known as the Crystal Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Stelis cristalensis is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
