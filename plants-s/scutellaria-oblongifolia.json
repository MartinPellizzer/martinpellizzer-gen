It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. Its genus name, Scutellaria, refers to the shield-like calyx that encloses the flower. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
