    "intro": "Strelitzia cucullata, commonly known as the helmet plant, is a striking member of the Strelitziaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped inflorescence that resembles a bird\u2019s beak, surrounded by vibrant blue-green bracts. The plant produces striking orange flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Strelitzia cucullata is often cultivated as a showy ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses due to its dramatic appearance."
