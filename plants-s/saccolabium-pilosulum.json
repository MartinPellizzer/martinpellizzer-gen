    "intro": "Saccolabium pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy saccolabium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, featuring a deep root system and hairy foliage to reduce water loss. It produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Saccolabium pilosulum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
