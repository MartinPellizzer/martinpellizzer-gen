    "intro": "Silene samia, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene samia plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
