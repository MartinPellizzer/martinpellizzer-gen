    "intro": "Stenomesson rubrum, commonly known as the red-stemmed bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. Stenomesson rubrum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils."
