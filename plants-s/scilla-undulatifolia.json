    "intro": "Scilla undulatifolia, commonly known as the wavyleaf scilla, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a wavy or undulating edge. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Scilla undulatifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
