    "intro": "Sicyos acerifolius, commonly known as the horse chestnut vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the horse chestnut tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a spiny, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Sicyos acerifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
