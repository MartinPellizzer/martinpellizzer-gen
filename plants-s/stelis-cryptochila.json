    "intro": "Stelis cryptochila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and clustered at the base, while its flowers bloom in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Stelis cryptochila is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
