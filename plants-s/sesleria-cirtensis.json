    "intro": "Sesleria cirtensis, commonly known as the Cirtensis pink grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. Sesleria cirtensis prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
