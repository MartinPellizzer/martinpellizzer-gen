    "intro": "Santalum cygnorum, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, elongated pods containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and perfumes. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as a vulnerable species."
