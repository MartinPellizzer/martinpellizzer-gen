    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata var. compacta, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
