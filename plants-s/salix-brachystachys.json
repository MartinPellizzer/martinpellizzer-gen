    "intro": "Salix brachystachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats or along forest edges. Salix brachystachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
