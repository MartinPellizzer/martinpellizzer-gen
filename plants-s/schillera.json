    "intro": "Schillera, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the Rosaceae family. It consists of several species, most notably Schillera splendens, which is native to the western United States. The plants are shrubs or small trees, typically characterized by their thorny branches and showy white or pink flowers. Their leaves are usually oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they produce small, red berries in the fall. Schillera species are often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
