    "intro": "Solidago hapemaniana, commonly known as Hapeman's goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is characterized by its clustered inflorescences of bright yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
