    "intro": "Statice minuta var. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic statice, is a small, flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. It blooms in late summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts are underway to protect its natural habitat."
