    "intro": "Sempervivum carpathicum subsp. carpathicum, commonly known as the Carpathian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
