    "intro": "Salacia calypso var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf salacia, is a compact shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
