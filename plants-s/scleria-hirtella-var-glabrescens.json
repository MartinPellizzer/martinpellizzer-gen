    "intro": "Scleria hirtella var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-headed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its habitat. The varietal name 'glabrescens' refers to its smooth, hairless appearance compared to the typical form of S. hirtella."
