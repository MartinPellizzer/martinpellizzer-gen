    "intro": "Sanguisorba spachiana, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking clusters of bright red, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Sanguisorba spachiana thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after plant in rock gardens and alpine collections."
