    "intro": "Stipa borysthenica, commonly known as the Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and sandy soils, and it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Stipa borysthenica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
