It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces a latex sap that has been used traditionally for its elastic properties. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its botanical features include a caudex, or swollen base, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Scyphostelma lechleri is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
