It is characterized by its long, slender panicles that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, two-lobed spikelets that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its grain or as a forage crop. Its fibrous stalks are also used in traditional crafts and construction."
