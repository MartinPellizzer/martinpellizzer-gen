    "intro": "Strophanthus mortehanii, commonly known as the African blood vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a climbing shrub that produces striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has thick, woody stems and is often found growing along riverbanks or in moist forest areas. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a distinctive, strong scent. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it both toxic and historically significant in traditional medicine."
