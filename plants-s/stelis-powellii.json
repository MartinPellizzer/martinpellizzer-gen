    "intro": "Stelis powellii, commonly known as the Powell's stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant features a short, compact stem with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually appear in clusters, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Stelis powellii thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires careful attention to watering and light levels for optimal growth."
