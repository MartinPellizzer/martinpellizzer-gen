It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Syringodea sceptriformis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology and cultural significance make it a notable species in both ecological and symbolic contexts."
