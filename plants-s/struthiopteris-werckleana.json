    "intro": "Struthiopteris werckleana, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
