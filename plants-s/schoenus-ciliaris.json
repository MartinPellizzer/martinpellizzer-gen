    "intro": "Schoenus ciliaris, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats. Schoenus ciliaris is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
