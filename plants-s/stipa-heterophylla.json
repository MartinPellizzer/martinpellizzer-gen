    "intro": "Stipa heterophylla, commonly known as the variable grass or slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned spikelets. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed soils. Stipa heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
