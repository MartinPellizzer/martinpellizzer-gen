    "intro": "Selaginella simulans, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella simulans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance."
