    "intro": "Salmia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Salmia species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, often with woody stems and small, scale-like leaves adapted to conserve water. They bloom during the warmer months, producing vibrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, some species of Salmia are cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
