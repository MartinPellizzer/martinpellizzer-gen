It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with small, granular protrusions, giving the plant its varietal name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale green. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks."
