    "intro": "Schefflera costata, commonly known as the laceleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera costata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for bonsai and landscape gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
