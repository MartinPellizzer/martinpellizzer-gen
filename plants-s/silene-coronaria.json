It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that resemble a crown, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene coronaria is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
