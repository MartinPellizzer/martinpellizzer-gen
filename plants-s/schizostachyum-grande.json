    "intro": "Schizostachyum grande, commonly known as the giant bamboo or golden bamboo, is a tall, woody grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are often borne at the top of the stem. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Schizostachyum grande is valued for its rapid growth and is used in construction, papermaking, and as a ornamental plant."
