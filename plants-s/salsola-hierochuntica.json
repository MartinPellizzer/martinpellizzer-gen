    "intro": "Salsola hierochuntica, commonly known as the Jordanian saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically greenish-white in color. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Salsola hierochuntica is also valued for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and low precipitation."
