    "intro": "Solanum silvestre, commonly known as wild nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to red or yellow as they mature. Solanum silvestre contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested, though it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive yet cautious subject in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
