    "intro": "Sophora calyptrata, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its potential health benefits."
