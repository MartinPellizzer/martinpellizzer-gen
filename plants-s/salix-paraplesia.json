    "intro": "Salix paraplesia, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems arising from the base and dense foliage of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the growing season. Salix paraplesia is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor soils and often growing in moist, rocky habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
