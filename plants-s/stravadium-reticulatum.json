    "intro": "Stravadium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its intricate, web-like vein patterns on its leaves. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly the Andean foothills. The plant features tall, slender stems with clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, Stravadium reticulatum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
