    "intro": "Sabadilla dubia, commonly known as the white sabadilla, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated due to its toxicity and specific growing requirements."
