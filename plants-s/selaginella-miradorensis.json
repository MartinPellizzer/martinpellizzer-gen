    "intro": "Selaginella miradorensis, commonly known as the Mirador spleenwort, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Selaginella miradorensis is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and has adapted to retain moisture efficiently. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in tropical ecosystems."
