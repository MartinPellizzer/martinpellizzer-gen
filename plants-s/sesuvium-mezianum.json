    "intro": "Sesuvium mezianum, commonly known as the coastal sesuvium, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, often found on sandy or rocky shores where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid conditions. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Sesuvium mezianum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
