    "intro": "Salix obtusa, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Salix obtusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
