    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum var. bungeana, commonly known as the Bunge's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, accompanied by opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its slender, branched stems are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is closely related to other members of the Stellaria genus, sharing similar morphological traits and ecological preferences."
