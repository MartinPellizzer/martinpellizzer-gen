    "intro": "Solanum trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant features small, white or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Solanum trifidum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
