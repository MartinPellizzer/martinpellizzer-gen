    "intro": "Spergularia media subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed, dry habitats."
