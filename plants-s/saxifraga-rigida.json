    "intro": "Saxifraga rigida, commonly known as the hardy saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a compact inflorescence. Saxifraga rigida is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
