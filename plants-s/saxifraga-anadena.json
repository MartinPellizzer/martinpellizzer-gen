    "intro": "Saxifraga anadena, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Saxifraga anadena is often found growing in rocky crevices and open meadows at high altitudes."
