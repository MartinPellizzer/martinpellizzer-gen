    "intro": "Saussurea lhunzhubensis, commonly known as the Lhunzhi saussurea, is a rare alpine plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and pale yellow to brownish flower heads. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, dry conditions, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it produces achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
