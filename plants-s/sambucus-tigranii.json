    "intro": "Sambucus tigranii, commonly known as the Armenian elderberry, is a species of flowering plant in the honeysuckle family. It is native to the Caucasus region, particularly Armenia and Georgia, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. These flowers give way to dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Sambucus tigranii is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
