    "intro": "Stenarrhena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, pale green or white flower. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the forest floor or among leaf litter. Its flowers are typically small and have a delicate, almost ethereal appearance, which contributes to its common name. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Stenarrhena is considered a threatened species and is protected in its native range."
