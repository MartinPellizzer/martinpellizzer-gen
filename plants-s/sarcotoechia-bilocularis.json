    "intro": "Sarcotoechia bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered sarcotoechia, is a unique species within the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive two-chambered fruit structure, which sets it apart from other members of the genus. The plant produces small, aromatic leaves with a rough texture, typical of many myrtle family members. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
