    "intro": "Sedum telephium, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum telephium is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
