It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually ovate with hairy surfaces. Sida limensis is adapted to withstand salty air and wind, making it a common pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
