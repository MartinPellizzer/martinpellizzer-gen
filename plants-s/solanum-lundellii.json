    "intro": "Solanum lundellii, commonly known as the Lundell's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude areas, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, which are characteristic of the Solanaceae family. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
