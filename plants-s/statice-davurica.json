    "intro": "Statice davurica, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense spikes of blue, violet, or white flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for coastal ecosystems. Statice davurica is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
