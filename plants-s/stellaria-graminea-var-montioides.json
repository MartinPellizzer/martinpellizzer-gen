It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes at elevations above 1,000 meters. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
