    "intro": "Sapium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically small and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
