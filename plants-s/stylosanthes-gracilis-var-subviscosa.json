It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves with a sticky surface. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are typically borne in racemes, followed by small, hairy pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage species for livestock. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen enhances soil fertility, contributing to its ecological and agricultural importance."
