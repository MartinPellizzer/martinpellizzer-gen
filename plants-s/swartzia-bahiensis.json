    "intro": "Swartzia bahiensis, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and the demand for its wood, it is considered an endangered species."
