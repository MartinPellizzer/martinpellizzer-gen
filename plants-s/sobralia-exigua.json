    "intro": "Sobralia exigua, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces striking, velvety purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Sobralia exigua is often cultivated in shaded gardens due to its preference for moist, well-drained soil and partial shade."
