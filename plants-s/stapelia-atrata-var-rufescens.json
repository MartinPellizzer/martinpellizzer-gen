It features a distinctive appearance with its star-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often red or purple in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for succulent collectors."
