    "intro": "Sisymbrium asperum, commonly known as hoary broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures, and relies on a symbiotic relationship with host plants for nutrients. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
