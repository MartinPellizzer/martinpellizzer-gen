    "intro": "Satyrium repens, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a low-growing perennial plant native to various regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinct lip or labellum that aids in pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in limestone soils. Satyrium repens is known for its ability to form dense mats, which helps it compete effectively in its natural habitat."
