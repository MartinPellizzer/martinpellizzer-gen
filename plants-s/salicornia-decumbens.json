    "intro": "Salicornia decumbens, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, and it is commonly found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Salicornia decumbens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
