    "intro": "Salix fusca var. repens, commonly known as creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as streambanks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are elliptical, hairy, and have a distinctive yellow-green color. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
