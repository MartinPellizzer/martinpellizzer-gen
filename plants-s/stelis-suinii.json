    "intro": "Stelis suinii, commonly known as the pig's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Stelis suinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
