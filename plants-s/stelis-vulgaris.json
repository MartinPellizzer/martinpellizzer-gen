    "intro": "Stelis vulgaris, commonly known as the common stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Stelis vulgaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
