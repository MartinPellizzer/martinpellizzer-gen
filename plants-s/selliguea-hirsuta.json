    "intro": "Selliguea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a member of the Pterobranchiata order and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. The plant's fronds are usually spirally arranged and have a leathery texture, with small, scale-like leaves. Selliguea hirsuta reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
