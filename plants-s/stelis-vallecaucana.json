    "intro": "Stelis vallecaucana, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high elevations. The plant features a short, erect stem with a single or few leaves, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Stelis vallecaucana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
