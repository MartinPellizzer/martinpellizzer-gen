    "intro": "Statice melia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and seaside cliffs. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. Statice melia is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to stabilize coastal soil."
