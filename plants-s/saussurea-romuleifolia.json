    "intro": "Saussurea romuleifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
