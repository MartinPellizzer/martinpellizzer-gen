    "intro": "Selaginella pallescens f. aurea, commonly known as the golden spikemoss, is a variant of the spikemoss genus Selaginella. It is a small, evergreen fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, spiral-shaped leaves that are often a striking golden-yellow color, distinguishing it from the more common grayish-green form. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are usually located at the tips of the stems. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
