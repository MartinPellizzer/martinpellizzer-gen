    "intro": "Sedum napiferum, commonly known as the tree sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern China. It is characterized by its upright, branching growth habit and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal water requirements."
