    "intro": "Spergula rimarum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a small, low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Spergula rimarum is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in temperate climates."
