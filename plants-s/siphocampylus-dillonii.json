    "intro": "Siphocampylus dillonii, commonly known as the Dillon's suncup, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
