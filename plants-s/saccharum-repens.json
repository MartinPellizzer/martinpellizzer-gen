It is characterized by its long, hollow stems and dense, fibrous leaves. The plant is cultivated for its high sugar content in the stem juice, which is processed into sugar and ethanol. Saccharum repens thrives in warm climates with abundant sunlight and water. Its growth habit makes it an important crop in agriculture and a significant contributor to global sugar production."
