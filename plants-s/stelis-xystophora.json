    "intro": "Stelis xystophora, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white and green, and bloom during the wet season. Stelis xystophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouse environments."
