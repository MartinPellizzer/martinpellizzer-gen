    "intro": "Saxifraga virginica, commonly known as the Virginia saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its showy flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are typically pink or white and are arranged in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. Saxifraga virginica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
