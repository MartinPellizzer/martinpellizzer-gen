    "intro": "Sedum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for desert landscapes."
