    "intro": "Scurrula clavata, commonly known as the club-shaped lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus with a distinctive club-like or branched structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environments. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. Scurrula clavata is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to air pollution and environmental changes."
