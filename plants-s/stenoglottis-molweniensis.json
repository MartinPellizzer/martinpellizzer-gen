    "intro": "Stenoglottis molweniensis, commonly known as the Molweni star lily, is a striking perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
