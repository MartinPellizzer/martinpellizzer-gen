    "intro": "Styloma eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved styloma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Styloma eriophora is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
