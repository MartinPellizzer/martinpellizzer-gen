    "intro": "Sanguisorba vulgaris f. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. It is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
