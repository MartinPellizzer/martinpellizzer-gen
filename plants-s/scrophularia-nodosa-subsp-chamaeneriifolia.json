    "intro": "Scrophularia nodosa subsp. chamaeneriifolia, commonly known as the creeping scrophularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
