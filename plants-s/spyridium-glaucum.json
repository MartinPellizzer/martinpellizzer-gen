It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Spyridium glaucum is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
