It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are rough to the touch and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and daisy-like, appearing in the summer months. Sonchus neglectus is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
