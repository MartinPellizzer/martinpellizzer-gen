It consists of several species, most notably Siederella alpina, which is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. The plant is characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Siederella is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in the local flora."
