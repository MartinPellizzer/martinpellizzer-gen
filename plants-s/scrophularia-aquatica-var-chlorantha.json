It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological variations and adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions."
