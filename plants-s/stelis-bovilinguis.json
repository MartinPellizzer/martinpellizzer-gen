    "intro": "Stelis bovilinguis, commonly known as the Bovilinguis orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Stelis bovilinguis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
