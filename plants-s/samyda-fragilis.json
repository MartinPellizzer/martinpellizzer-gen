    "intro": "Samyda fragilis, commonly known as the brittle samyda, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves that easily fragment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its fragile nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
