    "intro": "Stigmatopteris rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf stigmatopteris, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, round-shaped fronds that are typically divided into several lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Stigmatopteris rotundata plays a role in maintaining forest biodiversity and soil stability in its natural habitat."
