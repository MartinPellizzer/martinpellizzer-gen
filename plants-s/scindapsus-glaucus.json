    "intro": "Scindapsus glaucus, commonly known as the Silver Pothos, is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that often have a silvery or variegated appearance. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves. Scindapsus glaucus is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
