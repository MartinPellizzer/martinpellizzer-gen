It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release seeds. Sternbergia species are native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
