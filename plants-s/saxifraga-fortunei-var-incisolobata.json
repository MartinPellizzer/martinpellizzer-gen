    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. incisolobata, commonly known as the Fortune's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically elliptic to ovate, with a slightly wavy or toothed margin, and are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cool, dry climates."
