    "intro": "Solidago floribundus, commonly known as the showy goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. Solidago floribundus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the autumn season."
