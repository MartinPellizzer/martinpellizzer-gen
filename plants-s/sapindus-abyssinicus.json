    "intro": "Sapindus abyssinicus, commonly known as the Abyssinian soapnut, is a small evergreen tree native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces spherical, spiny fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fatty, soap-like substance. This substance is used traditionally for washing and as a natural detergent due to its saponin content. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
