    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. annua, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water and salt. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats. Its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
