    "intro": "Setaria polyneura, commonly known as shaggy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted, hairy inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct hairy texture along the edges. Setaria polyneura is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
