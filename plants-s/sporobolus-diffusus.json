    "intro": "Sporobolus diffusus, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form dense, sprawling mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. Its ability to spread vegetatively makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed soils."
