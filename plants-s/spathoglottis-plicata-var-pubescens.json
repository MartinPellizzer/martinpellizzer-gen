It features a rhizomatous growth habit with erect, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with dark purple or violet flowers that have a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves is a notable characteristic that aids in its identification."
