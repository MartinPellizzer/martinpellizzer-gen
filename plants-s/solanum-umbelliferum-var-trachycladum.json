    "intro": "Solanum umbelliferum var. trachycladum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from yellow to red, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland gardens."
