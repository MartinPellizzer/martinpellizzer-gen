    "intro": "Selaginella pilosula, commonly known as the hairy spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and its ability to form dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella pilosula reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its resilience to drought and ability to survive in poor soil conditions make it a common component of many forest understories."
