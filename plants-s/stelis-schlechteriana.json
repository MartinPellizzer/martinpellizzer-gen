    "intro": "Stelis schlechteriana, commonly known as the Schlechter's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis schlechteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
