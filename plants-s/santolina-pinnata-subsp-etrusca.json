    "intro": "Santolina pinnata subsp. etrusca, commonly known as the Tuscan santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, silver-blue leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are borne in dense, compact clusters. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice in xeriscaping."
