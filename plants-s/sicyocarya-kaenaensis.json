    "intro": "Sicyocarya kaenaensis, commonly known as the Kaenaensis sicyocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in specific regions of Hawaii. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
