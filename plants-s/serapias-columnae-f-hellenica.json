    "intro": "Serapias columnae f. hellenica, commonly known as the Hellenic rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the rocky habitats of Greece. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas on limestone or calcareous soils, thriving in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
