    "intro": "Sorghum scabriflorum, commonly known as the roughflower sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Sorghum scabriflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
