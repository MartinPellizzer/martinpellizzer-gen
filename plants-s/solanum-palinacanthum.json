    "intro": "Solanum palinacanthum, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
