It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring deep roots and succulent leaves. Sulaimania is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
