The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Sphinctolobium floribundum plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen and providing food for native wildlife."
