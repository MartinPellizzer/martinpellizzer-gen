    "intro": "Selaginella platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are located at the tips of the stems. Selaginella platyphylla is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
