    "intro": "Selaginella caulescens var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to South America. It features a creeping rhizome with erect, cylindrical stems that bear whorled leaves. The leaves are typically linear to ovate and have a distinctive midrib, giving the plant a delicate, moss-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is noted for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention."
