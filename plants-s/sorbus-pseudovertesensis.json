    "intro": "Sorbus pseudovertesensis, commonly known as the Transylvanian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Carpathian region of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, persistent berries that are edible for birds. It is adapted to rocky and calcareous soils, often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
