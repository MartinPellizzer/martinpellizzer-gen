    "intro": "Sapium herbertiifolium, commonly known as the Herbert's soapberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a single, hard-seeded pulp. The leaves and fruits contain compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine. It is often found in moist, open woods and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
