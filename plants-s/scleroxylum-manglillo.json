    "intro": "Scleroxylum manglillo, commonly known as the mangrove ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction and furniture. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove forests, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing several seeds."
