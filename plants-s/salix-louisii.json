    "intro": "Salix louisii, commonly known as the Louisiana willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its delicate, feathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, swampy habitats and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Salix louisii is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptability to wet soil conditions."
