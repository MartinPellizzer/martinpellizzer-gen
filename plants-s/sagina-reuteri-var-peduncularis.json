    "intro": "Sagina reuteri var. peduncularis, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas, dunes, and disturbed ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
