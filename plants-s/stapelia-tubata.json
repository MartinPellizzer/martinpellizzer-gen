    "intro": "Stapelia tubata, commonly known as the tubular stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced to spines, a feature common in many desert plants. Stapelia tubata is often grown as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
