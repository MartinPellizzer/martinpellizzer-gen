    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis subsp. mariana, commonly known as the Marianas moon cactus, is a compact cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a short, thick stem with a single, rounded, and often colorful top. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with the fungus *Cephalosporium* sp., which provides it with essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
