    "intro": "Selaginella arenaria, commonly known as the sand spikerush, is a species of spikemoss found in arid and semi-arid environments. It is a small, low-growing plant with needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions due to its ability to enter dormancy during periods of extreme drought. Selaginella arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
