    "intro": "Stellaria angarae, commonly known as the Arun Valley starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features slender stems with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. Stellaria angarae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
