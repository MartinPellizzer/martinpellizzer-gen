    "intro": "Seddera semhaensis, commonly known as the Jordanian seddera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Middle East, particularly found in Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seddera semhaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
