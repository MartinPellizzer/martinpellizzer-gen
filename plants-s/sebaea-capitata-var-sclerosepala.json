    "intro": "Sebaea capitata var. sclerosepala, commonly known as the hard-sepaled sebaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its distinct, often spiny fruit. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and the fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns from green to orange when mature. This variant is distinguished by its thick, hardened sepals that remain attached to the fruit even after maturity."
