    "intro": "Selloa scoparia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Selloa scoparia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important species in stabilizing sandy and disturbed landscapes."
