    "intro": "Stenotaphrum secundatum var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated st. Augustine grass, is a hybrid grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variegated leaf blades, which display a mix of green and white or silver hues, making it visually distinct. This grass thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in landscaping for its dense, turf-like appearance. It is highly tolerant of foot traffic and can withstand moderate drought conditions. However, it requires regular maintenance to maintain its aesthetic appeal and health."
