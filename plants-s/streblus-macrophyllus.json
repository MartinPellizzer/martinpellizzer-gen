    "intro": "Streblus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant fig-leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The tree produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting and reforestation projects. The plant also has a fibrous bark that is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
