    "intro": "Scleria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Australia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scleria pusilla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
