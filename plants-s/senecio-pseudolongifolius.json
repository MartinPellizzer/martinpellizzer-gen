    "intro": "Senecio pseudolongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
