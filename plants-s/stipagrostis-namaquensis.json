    "intro": "Stipagrostis namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Stipagrostis namaquensis is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
