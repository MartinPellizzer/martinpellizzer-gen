    "intro": "Salix crisposerrata, commonly known as the crinkled serrated willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and leaves that are narrowly elliptic with finely serrated margins. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery layers. Salix crisposerrata is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats."
