    "intro": "Salix pseudocordata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix pseudocordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
