    "intro": "Spergula nodosa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and distinctive flowering spikes that bear small, greenish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are short and narrow, and the inflorescence is usually clustered at the top of the stem. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
