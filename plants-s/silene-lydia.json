    "intro": "Silene lydia, commonly known as Lydia's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene lydia is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
