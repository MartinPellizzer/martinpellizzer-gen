    "intro": "Schizochilus crenulatus, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Schizochilus crenulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
