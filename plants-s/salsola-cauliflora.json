    "intro": "Salsola cauliflora, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small perennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered at the base of the stems, a characteristic known as cauliflorous growth. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Salsola cauliflora is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of harsh, dry habitats."
