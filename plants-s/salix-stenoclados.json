    "intro": "Salix stenoclados, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of white tomentum. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellowish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix stenoclados is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments."
