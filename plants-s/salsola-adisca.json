    "intro": "Salsola adisca, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in various regions. Salsola adisca is often found in dry fields, roadsides, and other disturbed areas across the western United States and parts of Europe."
