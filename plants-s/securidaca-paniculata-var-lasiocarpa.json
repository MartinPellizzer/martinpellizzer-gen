    "intro": "Securidaca paniculata var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough-hair vetch, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves with stiff, bristly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
