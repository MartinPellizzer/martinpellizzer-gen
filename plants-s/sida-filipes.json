    "intro": "Sida filipes, commonly known as silky sida, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or disturbed habitats, such as along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Sida filipes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil."
