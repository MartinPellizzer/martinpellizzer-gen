    "intro": "Sedum spathulifolium var. pruinosum, commonly known as the Prunose Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a powdery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
