    "intro": "Stelis zunagensis, commonly known as the Zunagense orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
