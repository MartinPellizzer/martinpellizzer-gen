    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a perennial plant characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, woolly foliage. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. The leaves are broadly ovate to rhombic, with a distinctive hairy texture that provides a tactile and visual contrast. Native to rocky and alpine environments, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging garden conditions."
