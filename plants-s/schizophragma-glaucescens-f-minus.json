    "intro": "Schizophragma glaucescens f. minus, commonly known as the small-leaved hydrangea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a lighter green than the standard species, with a glaucous, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This form is prized for its compact size and ornamental foliage, offering a unique alternative to larger hydrangea varieties."
