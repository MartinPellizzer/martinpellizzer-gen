    "intro": "Schoenorchis secundiflora, commonly known as the secondary-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and India. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its roots absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
