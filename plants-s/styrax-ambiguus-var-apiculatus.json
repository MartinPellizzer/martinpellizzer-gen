    "intro": "Styrax ambiguus var. apiculatus, commonly known as the Florida styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a pointed tip, giving the plant its specific epithet \"apiculatus.\" The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and forest edges."
