It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and rocky areas. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in early spring. Its subspecies brevipetala is distinguished by its shorter petals compared to other subspecies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
