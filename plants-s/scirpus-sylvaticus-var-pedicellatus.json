    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. pedicellatus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, lake shores, and slow-moving water bodies. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that appear in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
