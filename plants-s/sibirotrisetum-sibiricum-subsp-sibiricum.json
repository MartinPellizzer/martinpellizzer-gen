    "intro": "Sibirotrisetum sibiricum subsp. sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its overall structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as tundra and steppe. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler regions."
