    "intro": "Schismatoglottis kurimana, commonly known as the Kuriman\u2019s lady\u2019s slipper, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Schismatoglottis kurimana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
