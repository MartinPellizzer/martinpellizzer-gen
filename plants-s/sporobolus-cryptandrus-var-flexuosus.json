It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged and often have a distinctive blue hue, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Botanically, it is noted for its rhizomatous growth and the ability to form extensive colonies."
