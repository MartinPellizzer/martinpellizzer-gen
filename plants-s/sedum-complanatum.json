    "intro": "Sedum complanatum, commonly known as the flat sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, flat, oval-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum complanatum is also known for its ability to thrive in full sun and its role in attracting pollinators."
