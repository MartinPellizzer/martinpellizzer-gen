    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. estrusca, commonly known as the Spanish santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a strongly aromatic scent, reminiscent of thyme and sage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact, rounded inflorescences. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its foliage is also used in aromatherapy and herbal remedies for its calming properties."
