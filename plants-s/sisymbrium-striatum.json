    "intro": "Sisymbrium striatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf winter cress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring alternate, pinnately divided leaves with a distinctive narrow, linear shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, elongated pods that split open to release the seeds when mature. Sisymbrium striatum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
