    "intro": "Specklinia francesiana, commonly known as the Francesiana orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
