    "intro": "Selliguea feeioides, commonly known as the tropical moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct dorsal and ventral surface, and it lacks true leaves but has specialized structures called phyllidia. Selliguea feeioides thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often forming part of the epiphytic flora on trees and rocks. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are usually located on the dorsal surface of the thallus."
