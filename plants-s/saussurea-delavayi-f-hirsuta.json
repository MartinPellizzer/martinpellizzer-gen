It is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of western China, characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of yellow-orange flower heads. The plant features hairy leaves and bracts, which give it its distinguishing \"hirsuta\" designation. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky areas, often in regions with cool, moist climates. The flower heads are composed of many small, ray-like florets, typical of the Asteraceae family."
