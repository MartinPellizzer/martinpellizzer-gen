    "intro": "Spiranthes gracilis var. brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs, swamps, and wet meadows. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, elongated flower spike. The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
