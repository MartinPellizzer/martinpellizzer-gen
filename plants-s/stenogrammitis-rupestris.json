    "intro": "Stenogrammitis rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and prefers rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on limestone or granite outcrops. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Stenogrammitis rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
