    "intro": "Schinus huigan var. undulata, commonly known as the undulated poisonwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruits are woody drupes that contain a single seed, and the plant is known for its toxic properties, particularly in its bark and leaves. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by livestock and humans, though it plays a role in local ecosystems."
