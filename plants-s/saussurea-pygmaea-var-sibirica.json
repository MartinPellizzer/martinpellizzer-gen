    "intro": "Saussurea pygmaea var. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian dwarf fleabane, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It features a compact rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
