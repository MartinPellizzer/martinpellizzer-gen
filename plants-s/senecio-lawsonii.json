    "intro": "Senecio lawsonii, commonly known as the Lawson's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are generally gray-green, covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Senecio lawsonii produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
