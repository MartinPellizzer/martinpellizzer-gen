    "intro": "Schoenoplectus rogersii, commonly known as the California bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to six feet. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers in the summer months. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil in marshy environments, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Schoenoplectus rogersii is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
