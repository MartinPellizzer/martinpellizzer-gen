    "intro": "Saxifraga pedatifida, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga pedatifida thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
