It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped stigma that aids in pollination by trapping pollen grains. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, depending on the species. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged symmetrically. Spirostigma species are often found in temperate regions and are valued for their ornamental flowers and ecological benefits."
