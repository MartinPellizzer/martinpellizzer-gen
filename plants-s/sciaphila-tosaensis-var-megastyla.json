It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, large, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that aids in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
