    "intro": "Statice littoralis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and salt marshes. The plant produces dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Statice littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
