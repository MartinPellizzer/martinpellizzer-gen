    "intro": "Spatalla salsoloides, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in dune environments or along the coast. Spatalla salsoloides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
