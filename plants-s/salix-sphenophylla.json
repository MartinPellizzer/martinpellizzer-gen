    "intro": "Salix sphenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is an important component of the vegetation in cold, high-latitude ecosystems."
