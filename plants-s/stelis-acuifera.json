    "intro": "Stelis acuifera, commonly known as the sharp-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
