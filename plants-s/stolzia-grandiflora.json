It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive black center. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Stolzia grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine."
