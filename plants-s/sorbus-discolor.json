    "intro": "Sorbus discolor, commonly known as the variable whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that vary in shape and size, often appearing ovate to elliptic. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, bright red berries in the autumn. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin, flaky layers. Sorbus discolor is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
