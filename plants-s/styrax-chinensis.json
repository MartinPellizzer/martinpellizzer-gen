    "intro": "Styrax chinensis, commonly known as Chinese frankincense, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a perfume. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy surface. Styrax chinensis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
