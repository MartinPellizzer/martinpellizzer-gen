    "intro": "Setaria viridis f. japonica, commonly known as Japanese green millet, is a variant of green millet native to East Asia. It is a herbaceous annual grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. It is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for seed production."
