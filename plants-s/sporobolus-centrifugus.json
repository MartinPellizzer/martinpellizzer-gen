    "intro": "Sporobolus centrifugus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that contributes to its success in arid environments. Sporobolus centrifugus is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in native plant communities."
