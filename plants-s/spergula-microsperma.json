    "intro": "Spergula microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are minute and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Spergula microsperma is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
