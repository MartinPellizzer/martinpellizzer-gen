It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and compound leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control."
