    "intro": "Symphachne xyroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in dense stands, forming a mat-like structure that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 2 millimeters wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it reproduces primarily through rhizomes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Symphachne xyroides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
