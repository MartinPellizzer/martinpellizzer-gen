    "intro": "Spergularia lycia, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Spergularia lycia plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
