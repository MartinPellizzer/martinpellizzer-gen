    "intro": "Stelis contorta, commonly known as the twisted stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant aroma. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis contorta is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
