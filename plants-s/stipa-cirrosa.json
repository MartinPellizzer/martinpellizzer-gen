    "intro": "Stipa cirrosa, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that gives it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
