    "intro": "Schnella microstachya var. microstachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along water edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. It is often found in freshwater habitats and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
