    "intro": "Senecio furfuraceus, commonly known as the Woolly Senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
