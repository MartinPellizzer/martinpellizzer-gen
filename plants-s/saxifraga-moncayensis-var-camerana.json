    "intro": "Saxifraga moncayensis var. camerana, commonly known as the Cameran saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
