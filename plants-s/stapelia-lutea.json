    "intro": "Stapelia lutea, commonly known as the yellow star of Africa, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia lutea is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
