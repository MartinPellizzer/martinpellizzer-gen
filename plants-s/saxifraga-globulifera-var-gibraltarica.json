    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. gibraltarica, commonly known as the Gibraltar saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rock formations of Gibraltar. It features compact, rosette-like foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
