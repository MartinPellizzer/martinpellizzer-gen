    "intro": "Salix floribunda, commonly known as the flowering willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in wet, boggy soils and is often found along streams and lakeshores. Salix floribunda plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
