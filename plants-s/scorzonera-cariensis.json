    "intro": "Scorzonera cariensis, commonly known as the Armenian scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its upright stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive purple-tinged base, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be quite extensive, adapting to the rocky and well-drained soils of its habitat. Scorzonera cariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
