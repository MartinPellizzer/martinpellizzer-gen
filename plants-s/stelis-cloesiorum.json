    "intro": "Stelis cloesiorum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive golden hue and intricate lip structure. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis cloesiorum thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
