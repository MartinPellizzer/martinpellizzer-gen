    "intro": "Selago goetzei subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its slender stems and small, often blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
