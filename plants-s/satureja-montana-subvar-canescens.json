    "intro": "Satureja montana subvar. canescens, commonly known as mountain savory, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in elongated inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. This subspecies is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its pungent, thyme-like aroma."
