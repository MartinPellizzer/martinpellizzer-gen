    "intro": "Sciophila sessilifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowers rise above the water surface. Sciophila sessilifolia is adapted to nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
