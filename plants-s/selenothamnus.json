    "intro": "Selenothamnus, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Selenothamnus species typically have upright growth habits and produce small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to yellow. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
