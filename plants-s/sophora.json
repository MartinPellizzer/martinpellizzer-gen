    "intro": "Sophora, commonly known as the Chinese\u69d0 or locust tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of approximately 30 species, predominantly native to Asia, with some species found in North America and Africa. The plants are characterized by their bipinnate leaves, showy yellow or white flowers, and often produce long, pod-like fruits. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and for their nitrogen-fixing properties."
