    "intro": "Solidago nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-stem goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that emerge directly from the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along streambanks. Solidago nudiflora plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late season."
