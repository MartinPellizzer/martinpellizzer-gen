    "intro": "Sarcostemma stipitatum, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicle fruits containing toxic, seeds with a hairy pappus. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it is important to handle the plant with care."
