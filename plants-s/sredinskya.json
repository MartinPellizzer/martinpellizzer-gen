    "intro": "Sredinskya, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers and woody stems. Sredinskya species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and some are valued for their aromatic wood. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, several species are now threatened with extinction."
