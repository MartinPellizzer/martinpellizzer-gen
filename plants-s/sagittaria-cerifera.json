    "intro": "Sagittaria cerifera, commonly known as the candleplant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters at the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, often forming a showy display. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the soil, allowing it to colonize wetlands and marshes effectively. Sagittaria cerifera plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
