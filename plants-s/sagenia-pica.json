    "intro": "Sagenia pica, commonly known as the white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and spiritual practices for their purported cleansing properties. Sagenia pica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
