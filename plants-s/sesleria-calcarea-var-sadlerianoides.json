    "intro": "Sesleria calcarea var. sadlerianoides, commonly known as the Sadler's bentgrass, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in summer, which are arranged in tight, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
