    "intro": "Steffensia flexuosa, commonly known as the slender leaved steppe grass, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of central Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand the dry, windy conditions of its habitat. Steffensia flexuosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates."
