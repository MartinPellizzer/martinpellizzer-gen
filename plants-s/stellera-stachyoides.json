    "intro": "Stellera stachyoides, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are typically reddish in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Stellera stachyoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
