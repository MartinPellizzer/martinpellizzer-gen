    "intro": "Scutellaria slametensis, commonly known as the Slamet mountain skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, two-lipped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
