    "intro": "Saponaria perfoliata, commonly known as the soapwort or perfoliate saponaria, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive basal leaves that appear to be perforated by the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain saponins, which produce a soapy lather when crushed, hence the common name. Saponaria perfoliata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
