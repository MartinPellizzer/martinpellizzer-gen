    "intro": "Scirpus torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus torreyi plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
