    "intro": "Spuriomitella, commonly known as the false broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green in color. Spuriomitella is found in various regions across Europe and Asia, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
