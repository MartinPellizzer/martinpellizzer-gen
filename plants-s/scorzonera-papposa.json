    "intro": "Scorzonera papposa, commonly known as the common scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets and a central disk, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Scorzonera papposa is also valued for its edible roots, which have a slightly sweet and nutty flavor."
