    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis var. aglaia, commonly known as the Tiraqu\u00e9n Cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the Andean region of Peru. It features a cluster of short, cylindrical stems that are typically pale green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-draining soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
