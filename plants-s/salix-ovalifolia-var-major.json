    "intro": "Salix ovalifolia var. major, commonly known as the large-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, which is a typical feature of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
