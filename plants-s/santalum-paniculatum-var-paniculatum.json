    "intro": "Santalum paniculatum var. paniculatum, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. It typically grows in coastal and tropical regions, featuring small, leathery leaves and fragrant white flowers. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important component of certain Australian ecosystems."
