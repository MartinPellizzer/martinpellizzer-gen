    "intro": "Solanum halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush tomato, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is adapted to thrive in high-salt conditions. The plant produces small, often yellow or orange fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain water in dry climates. Solanum halophilum is valued for its resilience and potential use in agriculture in saline soils."
