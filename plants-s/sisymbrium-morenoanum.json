    "intro": "Sisymbrium morenoanum, commonly known as Moreno's broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of host plants. Sisymbrium morenoanum is native to South America and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
