    "intro": "Siphonodon celastrineus var. acuminatissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crossvine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in terminal racemes, often resembling those of the trumpet vine. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid environments."
