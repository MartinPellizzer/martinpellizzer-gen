    "intro": "Scilla paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 cm and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often shorter than the flower stalks. Its bulbs are small and white, with a fibrous covering, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Scilla paucifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early blooming flowers."
