    "intro": "Stylophorum lanceolatum, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant's flowers are typically borne on slender, hairy stems and are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela. It thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Stylophorum lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for early pollinators."
