    "intro": "Stelis uncifera, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to surfaces without parasitizing the host. Stelis uncifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
