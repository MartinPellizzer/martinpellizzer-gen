    "intro": "Struthanthus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
