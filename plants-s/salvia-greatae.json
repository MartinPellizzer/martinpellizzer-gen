    "intro": "Salvia greatae, commonly known as the Mexican giant sage, is a striking perennial shrub native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine white hairs. Salvia greatae is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and resilience have made it a popular plant in both gardens and botanical collections."
