    "intro": "Salix holargyrea, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and striking silver-white to gray-green foliage. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, silky texture on the upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
