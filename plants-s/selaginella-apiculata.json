    "intro": "Selaginella apiculata, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with spirally arranged leaves and a low-growing, creeping habit. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella apiculata is also notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water conservation mechanisms."
