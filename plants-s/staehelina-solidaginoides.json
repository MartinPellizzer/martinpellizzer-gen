    "intro": "Staehelina solidaginoides, commonly known as the golden tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of individual flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sunlight, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Staehelina solidaginoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
