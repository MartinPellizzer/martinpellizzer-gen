    "intro": "Selago dinteri subsp. dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's selago, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is a succulent plant characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
