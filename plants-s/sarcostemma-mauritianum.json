It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Sarcostemma mauritianum is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests."
