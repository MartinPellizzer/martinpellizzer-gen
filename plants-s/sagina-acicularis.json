    "intro": "Sagina acicularis, commonly known as common sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has tiny, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length, giving it a distinctive, moss-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Sagina acicularis is also known for its ability to form dense carpets, which can help prevent soil erosion."
