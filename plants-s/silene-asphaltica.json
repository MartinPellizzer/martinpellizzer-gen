    "intro": "Silene asphaltica, commonly known as the asphalt plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Silene asphaltica is often found in rocky soils and is considered a resilient species in dry climates."
