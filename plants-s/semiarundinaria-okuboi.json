    "intro": "Semiarundinaria okuboi, commonly known as the Okuboi bamboo, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Thailand and Malaysia. It is a tall, clump-forming grass that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or wetland areas. Its rapid growth rate and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in certain regions. The Okuboi bamboo is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional crafts and construction in its native habitats."
