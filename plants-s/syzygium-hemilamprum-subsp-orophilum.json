    "intro": "Syzygium hemilamprum subsp. orophilum, commonly known as the mountain satinash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy and lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of primary rainforest. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
