    "intro": "Sedum amplexicaule var. ciliatum, commonly known as the Ciliated Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, overlapping leaves that give it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its common name refers to the finely ciliate (fringed) edges of its leaves, which are a distinguishing characteristic."
