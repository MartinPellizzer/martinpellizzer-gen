    "intro": "Solanum oligospermum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
