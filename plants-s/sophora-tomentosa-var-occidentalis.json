It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy bark and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that mature in the fall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
