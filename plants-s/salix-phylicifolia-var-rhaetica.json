    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian willow, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps and adjacent regions."
