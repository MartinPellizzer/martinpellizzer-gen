    "intro": "Senecio pinnatus var. pectinatus, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are sharply serrated along the edges. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
