    "intro": "Sedum tetractinum, commonly known as the blue sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum tetractinum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
