    "intro": "Salix idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and separate female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streams, lakes, and wetlands. Idaho willow plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
