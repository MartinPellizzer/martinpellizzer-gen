    "intro": "Sphenandra, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, elongated segments. Sphenandra species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
