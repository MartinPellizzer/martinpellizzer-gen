    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium subsp. littorale, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale brown seeds. This subspecies is adapted to salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, marshes, and tidal flats. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
