It is a herbaceous perennial with simple, alternate leaves and produces striking pink to red flowers in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it is pollinated primarily by insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to the main species."
