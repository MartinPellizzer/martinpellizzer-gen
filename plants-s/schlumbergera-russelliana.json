    "intro": "Schlumbergera russelliana, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a popular epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that form a branching structure, and it produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the holiday season. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a short-day plant, meaning it flowers in response to shorter daylight hours, typically around Thanksgiving to Christmas. Its unique appearance and festive blooming make it a favored houseplant worldwide."
