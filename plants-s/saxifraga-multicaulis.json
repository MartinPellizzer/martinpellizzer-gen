    "intro": "Saxifraga multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant features hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine tundra habitats. Saxifraga multicaulis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various insect and animal species."
