    "intro": "Stegania minor, commonly known as the dwarf stegania, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in nutrient-poor soils. Stegania minor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in controlled environments."
