    "intro": "Spiranthes bightensis, commonly known as the Bight Ladies' Tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes form a dense underground network, contributing to its ability to persist in its specialized environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status."
