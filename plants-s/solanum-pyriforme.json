    "intro": "Solanum pyriforme, commonly known as the eggplant bush, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its small, egg-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. The plant produces white or purple flowers and has hairy, glandular leaves that are often mistaken for those of other solanaceous species. Solanum pyriforme is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in warm climates. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
