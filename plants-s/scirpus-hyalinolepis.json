    "intro": "Scirpus hyalinolepis, commonly known as the glassy bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, slender stems that are often covered with a waxy, translucent sheath, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers. Scirpus hyalinolepis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
