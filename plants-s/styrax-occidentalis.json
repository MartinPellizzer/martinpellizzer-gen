    "intro": "Styrax occidentalis, commonly known as the western frankincense or California styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Styrax occidentalis is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
