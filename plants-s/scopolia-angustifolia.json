    "intro": "Scopolia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf scopolia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Scopolia angustifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in shady, moist garden environments."
