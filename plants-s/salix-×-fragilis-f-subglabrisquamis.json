    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis f. subglabrisquamis, commonly known as the smooth bark weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its slender, drooping branches and distinctive smooth, pale bark. It is native to parts of Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a serrated margin, and they turn a striking yellow in the fall. This variety is adapted to moist soils and is often found near water bodies, where it thrives in wetland environments. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate urban conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping."
