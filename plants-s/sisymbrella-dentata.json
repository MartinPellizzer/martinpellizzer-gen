    "intro": "Sisymbrella dentata, commonly known as the toothed bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate and often have a distinctive toothed or serrated edge, contributing to its common name. Sisymbrella dentata is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
