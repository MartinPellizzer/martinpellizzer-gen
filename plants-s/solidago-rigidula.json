It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Solidago rigidula plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
