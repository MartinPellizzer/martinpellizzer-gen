    "intro": "Saxifraga clusii var. coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a terminal cluster. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
