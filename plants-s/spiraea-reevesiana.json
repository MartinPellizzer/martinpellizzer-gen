    "intro": "Spiraea reevesiana, commonly known as Reeves' spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Reeves' spirea is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and spring blossoms."
