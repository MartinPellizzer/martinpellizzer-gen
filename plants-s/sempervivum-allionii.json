    "intro": "Sempervivum allionii, commonly known as the Alpes Alps stonecrop, is a species of succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Sempervivum allionii is often used in rock gardens and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
