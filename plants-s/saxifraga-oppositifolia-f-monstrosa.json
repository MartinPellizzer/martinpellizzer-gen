    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia f. monstrosa, commonly known as the Arctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is noted for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
