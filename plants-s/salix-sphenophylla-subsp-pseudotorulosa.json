    "intro": "Salix sphenophylla subsp. pseudotorulosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a common feature in willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The subspecies pseudotorulosa is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and narrower leaves compared to other members of the species."
