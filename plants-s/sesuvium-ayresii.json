    "intro": "Sesuvium ayresii, commonly known as rock saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils. Sesuvium ayresii is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
