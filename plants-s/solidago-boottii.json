    "intro": "Solidago boottii, commonly known as the Boott's goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Solidago boottii plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is valued for its ornamental beauty in native plant gardens."
