    "intro": "Selago coerulea, commonly known as the blue selago, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and produces small, blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Selago coerulea is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
