    "intro": "Sium longifolium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in wet environments. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and wet meadows. Sium longifolium is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
