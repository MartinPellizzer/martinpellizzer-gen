    "intro": "Stenogyne davisiae, commonly known as Davis's honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds and insects. It is typically found growing in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
