It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a radiating pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas. Its foliage makes it an attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
