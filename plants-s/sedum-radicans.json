    "intro": "Sedum radicans, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, stem-like leaves that grow in a trailing or creeping manner. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or hanging baskets. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions."
