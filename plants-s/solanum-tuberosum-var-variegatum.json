    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which displays striking patterns of white, yellow, and green on its leaves. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. It typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, producing tubers similar to the common potato but with distinct visual features. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its tubers."
