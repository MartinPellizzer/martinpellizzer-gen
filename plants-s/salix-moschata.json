    "intro": "Salix moschata, commonly known as the fragrant willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and female flowers are typically found in separate clusters. Salix moschata is known for its aromatic fragrance, especially when the leaves are crushed. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
