    "intro": "Saponaria officinarum, commonly known as soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of pink or white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots contain saponins, which produce a soapy lather when crushed, giving it its common name. Saponaria officinarum is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
