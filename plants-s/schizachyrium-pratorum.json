    "intro": "Schizachyrium pratorum, commonly known as prairie dropseed, is a native North American grass species that thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that turns bronze in the fall. The plant produces delicate, feathery seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for native plant gardens and restoration projects. Schizachyrium pratorum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various pollinators and small animals."
