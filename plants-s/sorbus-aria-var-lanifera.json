    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. lanifera, commonly known as the downy whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy (lanifera means \"downy\") leaves, which are oval to elliptic in shape and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
