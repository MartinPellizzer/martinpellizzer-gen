    "intro": "Sphaeropteris macrosora var. reginae, commonly known as the Queen's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
