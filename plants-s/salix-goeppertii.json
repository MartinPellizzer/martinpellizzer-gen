    "intro": "Salix goeppertii, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and Korea. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a graceful, cascading appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
