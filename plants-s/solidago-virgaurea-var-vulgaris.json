    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. vulgaris, commonly known as the lesser goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
