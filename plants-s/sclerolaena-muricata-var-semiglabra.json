    "intro": "Sclerolaena muricata var. semiglabra, commonly known as the roughleaf sclerolaena, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, serrated leaves that are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
