    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis var. mollis, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn a striking yellow or orange in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
