It features fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. Sedum retusum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
