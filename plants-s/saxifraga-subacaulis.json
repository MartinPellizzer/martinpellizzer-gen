    "intro": "Saxifraga subacaulis, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, compact cushions or mats, which help it retain heat and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and bloom in early summer. Saxifraga subacaulis is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
