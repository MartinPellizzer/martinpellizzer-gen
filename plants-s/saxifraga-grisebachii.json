    "intro": "Saxifraga grisebachii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Saxifraga grisebachii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens."
