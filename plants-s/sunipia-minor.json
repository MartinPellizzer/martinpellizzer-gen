    "intro": "Sunipia minor, commonly known as the dwarf sunipia, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
