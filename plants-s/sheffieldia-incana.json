It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features stiff, erect stems covered in fine, whitish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually grayish-green in color. Sheffieldia incana produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical seed heads that are dispersed by wind."
