    "intro": "Stifftia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered stifftia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Stifftia uniflora thrives in sandy soils and is often found in areas with mild, coastal climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species that is vulnerable to environmental changes."
