    "intro": "Saponaria alsinoides, commonly known as the mouse-ear saponaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which are natural detergents used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Saponaria alsinoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas."
