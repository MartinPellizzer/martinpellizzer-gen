    "intro": "Salvadora persica var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered arak plant, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces a resinous sap that has been traditionally used in various cultural and medicinal practices. This variety is particularly noted for its high drought tolerance and its role in local ecosystems."
