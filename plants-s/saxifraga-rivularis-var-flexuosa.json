    "intro": "Saxifraga rivularis var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible water saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, rocky habitats in Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with succulent, often reddish stems that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It is well adapted to wet environments and is often found near streams or in shaded, damp areas."
