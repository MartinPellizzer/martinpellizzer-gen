    "intro": "Stelis cochabambae, commonly known as the Cochabamba stelis, is a species of orchid native to Bolivia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests or on rocky slopes. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants rather than in soil. Stelis cochabambae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
