These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, elongated spike bearing numerous small, spider-like flowers. Spadostyles species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian Ocean islands. They typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky areas. The flowers often have a delicate, fragrant appearance and are pollinated by specific insect species, making them ecologically significant in their native habitats."
