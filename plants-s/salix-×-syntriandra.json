    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 syntriandra, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and lanceolate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate trees. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
