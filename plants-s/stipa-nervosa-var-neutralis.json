It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and slender, cylindrical seed heads that are often adorned with silky hairs. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in grasslands, meadows, and open woodlands. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Its delicate appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitats."
