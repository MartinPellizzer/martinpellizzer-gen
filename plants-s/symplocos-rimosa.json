    "intro": "Symplocos rimosa, commonly known as roughleaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are rough to the touch, with a reddish-brown underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright purple berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Symplocos rimosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
