    "intro": "Smilax yui, commonly known as the Japanese arrowroot or Chinese smilax, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. Smilax yui is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in various soil types."
