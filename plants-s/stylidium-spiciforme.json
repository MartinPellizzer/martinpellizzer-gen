    "intro": "Stylidium spiciforme, commonly known as the spikeless sun-orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It features a compact growth habit with a single, erect stem that bears a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a dense cluster of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered closely together, giving it a spiky appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Stylidium spiciforme is notable for its unique floral structure and is a member of the Orchidaceae family."
