    "intro": "Sterigmostemum sulphureum subsp. glandulosum, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of small florets that attract pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular structures on both the leaves and stems, which contribute to its unique botanical identity."
