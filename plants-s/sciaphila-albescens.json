    "intro": "Sciaphila albescens, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in the understorey of dense forests. The plant produces small, white flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than soil. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
