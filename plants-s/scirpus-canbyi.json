    "intro": "Scirpus canbyi, commonly known as Canby's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of tall, stiff, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments. Scirpus canbyi plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species."
