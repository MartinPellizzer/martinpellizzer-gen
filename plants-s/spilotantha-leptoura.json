    "intro": "Spilotantha leptoura, commonly known as the slender-leaf spilotantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Spilotantha leptoura is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
