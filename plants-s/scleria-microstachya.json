It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in spikelets that are arranged in terminal clusters. Scleria microstachya typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
