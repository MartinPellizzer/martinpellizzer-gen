    "intro": "Schinus mucronulata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
