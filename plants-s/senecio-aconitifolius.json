It features striking, dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a deep, almost black hue. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a distinctive addition to succulent collections."
