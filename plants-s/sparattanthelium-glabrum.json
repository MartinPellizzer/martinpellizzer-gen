    "intro": "Sparattanthelium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that grow up to 30 centimeters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid conditions. Sparattanthelium glabrum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
