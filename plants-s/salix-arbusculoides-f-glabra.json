    "intro": "Salix arbusculoides f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a shrub native to parts of China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other willow species. The plant typically produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a serrated margin. This variety is adapted to moist environments and is often found in streamside habitats."
