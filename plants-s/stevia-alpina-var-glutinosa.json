    "intro": "Stevia alpina var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is closely related to other stevia species and is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are used as natural sweeteners. Due to its unique properties, it is often cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes."
