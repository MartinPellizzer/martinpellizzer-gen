    "intro": "Selaginella ambigua var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky crevices or dry soil, exhibiting a compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has needle-like leaves that are closely arranged along its stems, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to enter a state of dormancy. This variant is closely related to other species in the Selaginellaceae family, sharing similar morphological and physiological traits."
