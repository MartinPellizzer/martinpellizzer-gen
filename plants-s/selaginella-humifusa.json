    "intro": "Selaginella humifusa, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella humifusa is notable for its ability to survive in a variety of soil types and its role in maintaining soil stability in forest ecosystems."
