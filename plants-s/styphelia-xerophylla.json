    "intro": "Styphelia xerophylla, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime forests. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its arid and salty environment. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Styphelia xerophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
