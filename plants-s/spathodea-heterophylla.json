The plant has palmately lobed leaves that vary in shape and size depending on light conditions, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Spathodea heterophylla is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to provide shade in urban landscapes."
