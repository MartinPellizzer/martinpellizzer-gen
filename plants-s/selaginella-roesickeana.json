It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella roesickeana exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species in arid conditions. Its reproductive structures are often clustered at the tips of its stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
