    "intro": "Scopolia carniolicoides var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed scopolia, is a rare and attractive perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific care requirements."
