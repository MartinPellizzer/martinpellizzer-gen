    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green leaves that have distinctive red or purple markings. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, rocky or sandy soil. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
