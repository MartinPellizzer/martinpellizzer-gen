    "intro": "Scutellaria altamaha subsp. australis, commonly known as the Florida skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its flowering stems are often hairy, and the plant is characterized by its small, hooded flowers typical of the Scutellaria genus. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its restricted geographic distribution."
