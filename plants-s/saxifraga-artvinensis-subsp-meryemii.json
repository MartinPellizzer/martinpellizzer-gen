    "intro": "Saxifraga artvinensis subsp. meryemii, commonly known as the Artvin saxifrage, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
