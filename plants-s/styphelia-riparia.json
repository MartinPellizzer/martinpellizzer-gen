    "intro": "Styphelia riparia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Styphelia riparia is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
