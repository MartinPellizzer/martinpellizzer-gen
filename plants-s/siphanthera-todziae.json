    "intro": "Siphanthera todziae, commonly known as the Todzia's bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes various bellflowers and related genera. The plant is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinct purple or violet throat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Siphanthera todziae is considered a rare and endangered species."
