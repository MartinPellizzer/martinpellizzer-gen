    "intro": "Silene littorea var. minor, commonly known as the coastal pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense mats that help stabilize coastal dunes. Silene littorea var. minor plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
