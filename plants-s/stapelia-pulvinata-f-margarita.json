    "intro": "Stapelia pulvinata f. margarita, commonly known as the Margarita Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed stems. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost star-shaped appearance. These flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, due to their strong, unpleasant odor. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
