    "intro": "Solanum adspersum, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are followed by spherical, greenish-yellow fruits that turn red when mature. The fruits are edible and have a tart flavor, similar to that of a tomatillo, and are used in various culinary applications. Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils."
