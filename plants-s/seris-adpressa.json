    "intro": "Seris adpressa, commonly known as the flatleaf seris, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are closely pressed to the stem, a feature that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small groups along the stems. Seris adpressa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats."
