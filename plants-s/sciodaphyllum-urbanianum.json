    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum urbanianum, commonly known as the shadowwood fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum urbanianum is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
