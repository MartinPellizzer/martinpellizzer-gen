    "intro": "Sorbus cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh whitebeam, is a species of rowan tree native to western Britain. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters during late spring. The tree produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in woodland and scrub habitats, often on acidic soils. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
