    "intro": "Schefflera schraderiana, commonly known as the Schrader's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of large, glossy, dark green leaves that give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera schraderiana is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
