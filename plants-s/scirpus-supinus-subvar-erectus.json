It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas. Scirpus supinus subvar. erectus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions."
