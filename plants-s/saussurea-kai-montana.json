    "intro": "Saussurea kai-montana, commonly known as the Alpine Gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Saussurea kai-montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
