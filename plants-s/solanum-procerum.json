    "intro": "Solanum procerum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or purple, with five petals, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture but is of interest in botanical studies."
