    "intro": "Stryphnodendron dryaticum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has a straight, cylindrical trunk and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing dark seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface. Stryphnodendron dryaticum is also known for its slow growth and is considered a threatened species due to overharvesting."
