    "intro": "Sedum actinocarpum, commonly known as the starfruit sedum, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a star-like pattern, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum actinocarpum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
