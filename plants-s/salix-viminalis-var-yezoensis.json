It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan and the Russian Far East. This plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches that are often used in basket weaving and other crafts. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
