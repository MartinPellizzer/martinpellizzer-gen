    "intro": "Sphaeropteris mollicula, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female plants. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, storing nutrients and water, which helps it survive in dry conditions. Sphaeropteris mollicula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny environments."
