    "intro": "Spanoghea nephelioides, commonly known as the cloud-like fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble clouds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
