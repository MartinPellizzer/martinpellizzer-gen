    "intro": "Salix wuxuhaiensis, commonly known as the Wuxuhai willow, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate environments. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are catkin-like, appearing in early spring, and it produces small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
