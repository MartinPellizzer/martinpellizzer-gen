It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Spilotantha tridens is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical uses are not extensively documented."
