It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed raw. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
