    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis var. totorensis, commonly known as the Totorense Cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white to grayish-blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in full sun with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
