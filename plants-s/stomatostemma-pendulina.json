    "intro": "Stomatostemma pendulina, commonly known as the hanging-stoma plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant is notable for its elongated, hanging stems that support clusters of small, tubular flowers. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are adapted for pollination by specific insect species."
