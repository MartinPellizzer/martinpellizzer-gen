    "intro": "Solidago speciosa var. rigidiuscula, commonly known as the stiff-stemmed goldenrod, is a variant of the showy goldenrod native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
