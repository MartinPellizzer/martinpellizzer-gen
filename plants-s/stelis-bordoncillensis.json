    "intro": "Stelis bordoncillensis, commonly known as the Bordoncillensis orchid, is a species of orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that varies from white to yellowish-green. Stelis bordoncillensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
