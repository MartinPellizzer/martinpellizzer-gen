    "intro": "Salix depressa var. elatior, commonly known as the tall willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins, which are the primary means of reproduction for willow species, containing both male and female flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
