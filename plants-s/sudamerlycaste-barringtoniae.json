    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste barringtoniae, commonly known as the Barringtonia tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as fruit bats. The tree produces a fleshy, star-shaped fruit that contains numerous seeds enclosed in a gelatinous pulp. Its leaves are typically large, broad, and palmately lobed, providing shade in its natural habitat. The plant thrives in humid, coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems."
