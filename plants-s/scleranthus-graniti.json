    "intro": "Scleranthus graniti, commonly known as the rock sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Scleranthus graniti is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats."
