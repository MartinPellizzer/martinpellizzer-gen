    "intro": "Semenovia depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its botanical characteristics reflect its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
