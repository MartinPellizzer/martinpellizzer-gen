    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. erectopatula, commonly known as the purple willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are narrowly elliptic, with a silvery-white underside, and they turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
