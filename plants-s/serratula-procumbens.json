    "intro": "Serratula procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate sowthistle, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and potential to become invasive, it is considered a weed in many regions."
