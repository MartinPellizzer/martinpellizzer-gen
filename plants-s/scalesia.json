    "intro": "Scalesia, commonly known as the Hawaiian silversword, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears yellow-orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Scalesia species are adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including volcanic soils and high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, many Scalesia species are now endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival."
