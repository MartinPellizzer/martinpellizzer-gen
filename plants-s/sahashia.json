    "intro": "Sahashia, commonly known as the bluebells, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. Sahashia species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in mountainous regions. The flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are generally not widely commercially grown."
