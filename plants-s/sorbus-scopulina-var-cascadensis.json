    "intro": "Sorbus scopulina var. cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade mountain ash, is a rare and specialized variant of the mountain ash species. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive red berries that appear in the fall. This plant typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to cold, harsh climates, including a short growing season and frost resistance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
