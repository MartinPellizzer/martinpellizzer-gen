It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, spiny stems and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spherical, yellowish fruits resembling tiny tomatoes. Its botanical features include a woody base and a dense, fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Solanum abutilifolium is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
