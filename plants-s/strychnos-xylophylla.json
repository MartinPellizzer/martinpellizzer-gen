It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and distinctive, often spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish-orange berries that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine despite their harmful properties. Its bark and leaves contain alkaloids, making it both a valuable and dangerous plant in botanical and medicinal contexts."
