    "intro": "Spiraea lanatissima, commonly known as the downy spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features multiple stems that are covered in dense, white to grayish-white hairs, giving it a soft, downy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture on both sides. Spiraea lanatissima is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
