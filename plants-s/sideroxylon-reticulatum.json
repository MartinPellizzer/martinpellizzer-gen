    "intro": "Sideroxylon reticulatum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often reddish-barked trunk. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and timber, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
