    "intro": "Salix pyrolifolia var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for native landscaping."
