    "intro": "Styloncerus tenellus, commonly known as the slender ant-like beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and a distinctive head structure that resembles an ant. The plant association of Styloncerus tenellus is primarily with specific host plants, particularly those in the genus Eupatorium. Its larvae typically develop within the stems or leaves of these plants, feeding on the plant tissue. This beetle plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the natural cycle of plant decomposition and nutrient cycling."
