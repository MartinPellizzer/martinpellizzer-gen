    "intro": "Schedonorus triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Schedonorus triflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
