    "intro": "Stylisma rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf stylisma, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are rounded and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Stylisma rotundifolia is known for its seasonal blooming, with flowers appearing in late spring to early summer."
