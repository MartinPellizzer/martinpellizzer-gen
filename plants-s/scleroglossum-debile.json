    "intro": "Scleroglossum debile, commonly known as the weak-stemmed rock cress, is a small, perennial herb native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to anchor in crevices and absorb nutrients from poor soils. Scleroglossum debile is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in mountainous or semi-desert regions."
