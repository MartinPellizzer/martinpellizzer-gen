    "intro": "Schefflera pubens, commonly known as the woolly schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Schefflera pubens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
