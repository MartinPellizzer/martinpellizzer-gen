    "intro": "Sterculia paniculata, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has a thick, fibrous bark and can grow up to 30 meters tall, making it a significant component of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a rough texture. The tree produces woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
