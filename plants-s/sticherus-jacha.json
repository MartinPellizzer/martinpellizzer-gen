It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. Sticherus jacha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
