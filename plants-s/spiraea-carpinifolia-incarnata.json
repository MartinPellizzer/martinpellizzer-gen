    "intro": "Spiraea carpinifolia incarnata, commonly known as the white spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring multiple stems that are often reddish-brown in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraea carpinifolia incarnata thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges."
