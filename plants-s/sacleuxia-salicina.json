    "intro": "Sacleuxia salicina, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to tolerate and even thrive in salty soils. Sacleuxia salicina plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
