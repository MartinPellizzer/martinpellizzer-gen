    "intro": "Sorghum nutans subsp. contractum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other sorghum species. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid conditions. Its botanical features make it useful in ecological studies and as a potential forage crop."
