    "intro": "Sphaeralcea caespitosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round fruits called follicles, which contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Sphaeralcea caespitosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
