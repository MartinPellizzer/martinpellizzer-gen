    "intro": "Spiraea lobulata, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features arching stems with opposite, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Spiraea lobulata is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
