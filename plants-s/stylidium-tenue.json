It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a trigger mechanism. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces bright orange or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Stylidium tenue is often found in coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
