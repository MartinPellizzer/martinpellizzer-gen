    "intro": "Selaginella calostachya, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a vascular fern ally belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. Its sporophyte stage produces strobila (spore cones) at the tips of the stems, which release spores for reproduction. Selaginella calostachya is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
