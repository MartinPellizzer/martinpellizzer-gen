It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorls along the stem, typically blooming from summer to fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Salvia biflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
