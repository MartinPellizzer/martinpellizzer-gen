    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. sychnocephalus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color, and it thrives in marshy or aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. This variety is distinguished by its tightly packed flowering heads, which give it its common name."
