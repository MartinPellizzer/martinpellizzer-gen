    "intro": "Sabatia gracilis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the showy sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of showy pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as roadsides and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
