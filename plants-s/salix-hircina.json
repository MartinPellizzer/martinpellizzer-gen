    "intro": "Salix hircina, commonly known as goat willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fragrant scent when cut. Salix hircina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet woodlands."
