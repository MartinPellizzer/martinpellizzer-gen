    "intro": "Silene dioica var. glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Silene dioica var. glandulosa is primarily a herbaceous perennial, though it may occasionally behave as an annual in certain conditions."
