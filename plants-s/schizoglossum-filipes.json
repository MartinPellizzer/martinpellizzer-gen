It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates in its habitat. Schizoglossum filipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
