    "intro": "Salix viridula, commonly known as the green willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. Salix viridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
