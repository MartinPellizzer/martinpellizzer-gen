It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that split open to release seeds.
