    "intro": "Stenostephanus magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalen rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is a small perennial herb that typically grows in rocky coastal habitats. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
