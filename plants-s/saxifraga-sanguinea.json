    "intro": "Saxifraga sanguinea, commonly known as the red saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes. Saxifraga sanguinea is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
