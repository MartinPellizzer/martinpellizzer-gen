    "intro": "Swainsona eremaea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are often small, linear, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Swainsona eremaea is well-suited to drought and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments."
