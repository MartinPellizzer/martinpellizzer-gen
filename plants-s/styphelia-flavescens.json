    "intro": "Styphelia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the winter months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia flavescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
