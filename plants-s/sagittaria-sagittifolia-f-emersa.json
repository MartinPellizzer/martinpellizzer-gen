    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. emersa, commonly known as the upland arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant adapted to grow in wetland or aquatic environments. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinct midrib running along the center. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often rising above the water surface. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
