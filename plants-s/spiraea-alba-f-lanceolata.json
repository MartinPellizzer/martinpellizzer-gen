    "intro": "Spiraea alba f. lanceolata, commonly known as white spirea or white meadow spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and pointed, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. This variety is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It prefers partial shade to full sun and is relatively low maintenance once established."
