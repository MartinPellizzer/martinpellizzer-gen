    "intro": "Selliguea avenia, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form a dense, cushion-like growth. This species typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the leaf surfaces and are involved in sexual reproduction. Selliguea avenia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
