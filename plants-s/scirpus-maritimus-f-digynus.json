It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, such as tidal marshes and estuaries. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in coastal environments, contributing to the ecological stability of such habitats."
