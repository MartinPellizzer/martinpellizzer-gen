    "intro": "Shangrilaia, commonly known as the sacred mountain flower, is a rare alpine plant found in high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and serrated leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Shangrilaia is considered a conservation concern."
