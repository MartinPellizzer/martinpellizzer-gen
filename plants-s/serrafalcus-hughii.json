    "intro": "Serrafalcus hughii, commonly known as the Hugh's serrated fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaf blades that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. Native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and taxonomic studies."
