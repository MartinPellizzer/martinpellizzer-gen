    "intro": "Scleranthus pantocsekii, commonly known as the Hungarian sandrocket, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, open habitats. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
