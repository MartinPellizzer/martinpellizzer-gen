    "intro": "Sida crenata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread rapidly in new areas. Sida crenata is known for its adaptability and is considered a weed in many regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
