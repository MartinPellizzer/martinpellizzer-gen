    "intro": "Solanum acaule var. punae, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that mature to a striking red or orange color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
