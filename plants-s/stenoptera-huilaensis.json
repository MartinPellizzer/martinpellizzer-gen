    "intro": "Stenoptera huilaensis, commonly known as the Huila grass, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of grassland ecosystems in high-altitude environments."
