    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens subvar. litigiosa, commonly known as the litigiosa saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues, especially during the growing season. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in terminal cymes and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subvariety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
