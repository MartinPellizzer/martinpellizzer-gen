    "intro": "Solidago simplex var. nana, commonly known as dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in moist to wet habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
