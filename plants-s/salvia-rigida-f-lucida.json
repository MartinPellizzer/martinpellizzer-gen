It features striking silver-gray foliage that shimmers in the sunlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to native plant gardens."
