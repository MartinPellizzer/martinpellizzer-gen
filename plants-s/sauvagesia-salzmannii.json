    "intro": "Sauvagesia salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's sauvagesia, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature. Sauvagesia salzmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
