    "intro": "Solanum proboluspermum, commonly known as the moonlit nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night, aiding in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. Solanum proboluspermum is also notable for its toxic berries, which contain alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family."
