It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds with a distinctive, angular shape. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
