    "intro": "Selaginella popayanensis, commonly known as the Popayan spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are arranged along the stems, facilitating spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
