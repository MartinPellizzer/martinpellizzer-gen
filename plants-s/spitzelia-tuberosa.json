    "intro": "Spitzelia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous spitzelia, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces tuberous roots, which serve as storage organs and help it survive dry periods. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters and are pollinated by birds and insects. Spitzelia tuberosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
