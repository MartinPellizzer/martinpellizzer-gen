    "intro": "Senecio potamogetonifolius, commonly known as water thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy coating and a serrated margin, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in dense, spherical heads, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. This plant thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers."
