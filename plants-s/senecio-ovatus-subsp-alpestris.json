It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in a cluster. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
