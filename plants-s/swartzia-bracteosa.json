    "intro": "Swartzia bracteosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. Swartzia bracteosa is also known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
