    "intro": "Smilax densiflora var. christmarensis, commonly known as the Christmas smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It features woody stems with spiny tendrils that help it climb and spread through its environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its seasonal blooming pattern, often flowering around the holiday season, hence its common name."
