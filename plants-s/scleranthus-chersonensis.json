It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand dry and windy conditions. Scleranthus chersonensis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a characteristic species of semi-arid environments."
