    "intro": "Saxifraga ranunculifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant features small, palmate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are solitary, with five to seven white petals and numerous yellow stamens, creating a striking contrast. Saxifraga ranunculifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
