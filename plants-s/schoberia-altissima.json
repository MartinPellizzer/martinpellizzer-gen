    "intro": "Schoberia altissima, commonly known as the tall sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Schoberia altissima is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open plains, where it thrives in full sun."
