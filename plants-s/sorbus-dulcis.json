    "intro": "Sorbus dulcis, commonly known as the sweet white rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have serrated edges. Sorbus dulcis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
