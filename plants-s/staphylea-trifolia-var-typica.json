It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible hazelnuts that mature in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
