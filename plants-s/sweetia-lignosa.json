    "intro": "Sweetia lignosa, commonly known as the hardy sweetia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Sweetia lignosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
