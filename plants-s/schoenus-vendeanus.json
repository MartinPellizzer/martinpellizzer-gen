    "intro": "Schoenus vendeanus, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Schoenus vendeanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
