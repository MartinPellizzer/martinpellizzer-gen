    "intro": "Sedum beauverdii, commonly known as the stonecrop sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking resilient, ornamental plants."
