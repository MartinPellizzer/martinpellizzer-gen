    "intro": "Sorocea jureiana, commonly known as the Jure Island sorocea, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Jure in the Adriatic Sea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Sorocea jureiana is considered endangered and is protected under local conservation laws."
