    "intro": "Solulus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese starfruit or *Averrhoa carambola*, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive five-pointed star-shaped fruit, which is typically yellow when ripe. The plant is a small to medium-sized shrub with simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually glossy green. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces fruit throughout the year in suitable climates. The fruit is not only valued for its flavor but also for its nutritional content, including high levels of vitamin C."
