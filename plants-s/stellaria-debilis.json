    "intro": "Stellaria debilis, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender, branching stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along paths, and in garden beds. The plant is characterized by its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
