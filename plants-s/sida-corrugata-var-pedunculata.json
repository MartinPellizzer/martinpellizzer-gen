    "intro": "Sida corrugata var. pedunculata, commonly known as the woollyleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual with a sprawling growth habit and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are characterized by their corrugated texture and dense pubescence, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to its ecological adaptability."
