    "intro": "Sapindus saponaria var. saponaria, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long, and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, round, orange fruits that split open to reveal shiny, black seeds. Its fruit contains a soapy substance, which has been historically used for cleaning purposes. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
