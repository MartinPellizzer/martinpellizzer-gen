    "intro": "Stipa pubescens var. maritima, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
