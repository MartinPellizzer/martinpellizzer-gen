    "intro": "Samanea guineensis, commonly known as the African money tree or silky sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feathery leaflets, and its distinctive yellowish-pink flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces long, flat pods containing seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Samanea guineensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to a range of tropical climates."
