It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with a hairy stem that bears alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal racemes. Its root system is robust, with long, fleshy roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Scorzonera buphthalmoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas."
