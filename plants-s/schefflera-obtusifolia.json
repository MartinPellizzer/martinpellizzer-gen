    "intro": "Schefflera obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of large, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black, spherical berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant indoors or in shaded outdoor gardens. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both residential and commercial landscaping."
