    "intro": "Solanum lechleri, commonly known as the bark of the Amazon, is a perennial shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is most notable for its latex-rich bark, which contains high concentrations of toxic alkaloids such as berberine and sanguinarine. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used by indigenous peoples for treating various ailments. However, due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
