    "intro": "Saxifraga cinerea, commonly known as silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters during the spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
