    "intro": "Satureja sericea, commonly known as silverweed sage, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also bear a silvery coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its aromatic properties and use in traditional herbal medicine."
