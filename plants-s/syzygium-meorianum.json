    "intro": "Syzygium meorianum, commonly known as the satinwood or Australian satinwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to black bark that becomes glossy with age. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, dark blue to black berries. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Syzygium meorianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes."
