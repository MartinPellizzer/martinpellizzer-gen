    "intro": "Stenandrium diphyllum var. longiscapum, commonly known as the long-stemmed stenandrium, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and filtered light. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a glossy surface that enhances its ornamental appeal. This variant is notable for its elongated floral stems, which contribute to its unique and dramatic appearance."
