    "intro": "Salix lanata var. americana, commonly known as the American silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and long, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers before the leaves fully emerge. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers, and the plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for medicinal purposes."
