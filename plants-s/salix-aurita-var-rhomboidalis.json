    "intro": "Salix aurita var. rhomboidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and precede the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
