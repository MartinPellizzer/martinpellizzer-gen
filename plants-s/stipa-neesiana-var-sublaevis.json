    "intro": "Stipa neesiana var. sublaevis, commonly known as the smooth feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, silver-green florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, feathery appearance."
