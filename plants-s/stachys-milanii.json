    "intro": "Stachys milanii, commonly known as the Milan mint or Milan stachys, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typically in shades of violet or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
