    "intro": "Strophanthus horsfieldianus, commonly known as the African blood vine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots and leaves contain cardiac glycosides, which have been used in traditional medicine. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
