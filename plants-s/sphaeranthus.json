    "intro": "Sphaeranthus, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spherical, spiky flower heads that resemble small globes, giving them their common name. Sphaeranthus species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They produce small, often inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by bracts, which contribute to their distinctive appearance. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, many of which are used in ornamental horticulture for their unique foliage and floral structures."
