    "intro": "Sarracenia adunca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that form tubular traps to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are usually red or orange with a distinctive black midrib, which helps in attracting prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid environment to maintain its digestive processes. Sarracenia adunca is often found in bogs and swamps, where it plays a unique role in the local ecosystem."
