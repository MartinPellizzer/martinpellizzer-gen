It features a dense, rounded crown with thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to pets. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full shade. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor environments."
