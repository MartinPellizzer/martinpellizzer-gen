    "intro": "Selaginella plana, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and stems that often form dense mats on the forest floor. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Selaginella plana is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its capacity to retain moisture. Its unique reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, contribute to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
