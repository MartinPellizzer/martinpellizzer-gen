    "intro": "[WRONG START] Styrochaeton tortispathum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
