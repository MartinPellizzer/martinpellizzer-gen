    "intro": "Scolymocephalus repens, commonly known as the creeping scolymus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Scolymocephalus repens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
