    "intro": "Schoenoxiphium perdensum, commonly known as the hanging bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often drape over rocky outcrops or cliffs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with five petals arranged symmetrically. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Schoenoxiphium perdensum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
