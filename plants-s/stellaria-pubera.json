    "intro": "Stellaria pubera, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil."
