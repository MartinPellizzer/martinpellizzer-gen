    "intro": "Stelis heterosepala, commonly known as the showy stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically blooms during the summer months and is native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. Stelis heterosepala prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
