    "intro": "Salix buergeriana, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and Korea. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a graceful, cascading appearance. The leaves are simple, ovate, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist soils."
