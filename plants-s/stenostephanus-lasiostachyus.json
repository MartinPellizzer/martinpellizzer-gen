    "intro": "Stenostephanus lasiostachyus, commonly known as the woolly stephanus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Stenostephanus lasiostachyus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
