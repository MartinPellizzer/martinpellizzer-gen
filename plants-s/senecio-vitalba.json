    "intro": "Senecio vitalba, commonly known as groundsel or lesser groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are usually alternate, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive white or pale underside. Senecio vitalba produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spherical, dry fruits called cypsela."
