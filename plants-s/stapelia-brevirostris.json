    "intro": "Stapelia brevirostris, commonly known as the short-beaked stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, such as flies, rather than bees or butterflies. Stapelia brevirostris is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
