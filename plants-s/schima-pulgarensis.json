It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries. Schima pulgarensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in some regions.
