It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a glossy appearance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds for dispersal."
