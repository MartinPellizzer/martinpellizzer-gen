    "intro": "Sium triternatum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a somewhat fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its small white flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. The roots of Sium triternatum are often harvested and used in traditional herbal medicine."
