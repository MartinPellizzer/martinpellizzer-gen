    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 geum var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment."
