It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in forage and soil conservation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is commonly used in agroforestry systems. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for improving soil fertility in agricultural settings."
