    "intro": "Scaphespermum, commonly known as the yellow bell or yellow woodbine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Scaphespermum species are native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. The fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's reproductive strategy."
