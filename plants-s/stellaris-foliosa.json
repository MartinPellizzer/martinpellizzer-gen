    "intro": "Stellaris foliosa, commonly known as the starleaf plant, is a flowering species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in drier conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-like white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and moderately deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Stellaris foliosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to maintain in garden settings."
