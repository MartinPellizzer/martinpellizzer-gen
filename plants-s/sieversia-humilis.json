    "intro": "Sieversia humilis, commonly known as the small sieversia, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It typically grows in marshy or flooded areas, demonstrating a preference for moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has thin, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Sieversia humilis is adapted to aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help anchor it in soft, waterlogged substrates. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and amphibian life."
