    "intro": "Scirpus mucronatus subsp. clemensiae, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
