    "intro": "Scapha serrata, commonly known as the serrated scapha, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to violet. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with upright stems and opposite leaves that are often serrated along the edges. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Scapha serrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
