    "intro": "Stelis strobilacea, commonly known as the pineapple orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pineapple-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are long, strap-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Stelis strobilacea is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
