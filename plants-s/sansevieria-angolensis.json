    "intro": "Sansevieria angolensis, commonly known as the Angola snake plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly Angola, and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with light green or yellowish margins. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks, which bloom in late summer. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Sansevieria angolensis is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
