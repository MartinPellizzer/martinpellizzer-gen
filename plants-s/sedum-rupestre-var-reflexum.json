    "intro": "Sedum rupestre var. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
