    "intro": "Scirpus pumilus subsp. rollandii, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color. It is native to parts of Europe and is adapted to moist soils in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and ability to thrive in wet conditions, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
