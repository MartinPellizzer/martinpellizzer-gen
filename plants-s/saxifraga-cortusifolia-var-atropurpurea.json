    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia var. atropurpurea, commonly known as purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are typically oval or spatulate in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or barren landscapes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
