    "intro": "Stipa occidentalis var. pubescens, commonly known as the western wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
