    "intro": "Sparganium dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited bur reed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence and is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments. Sparganium dolichocarpum is a perennial plant that thrives in shallow water and can tolerate a range of water depths."
