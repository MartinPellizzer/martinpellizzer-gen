    "intro": "Senecio celtibericus, commonly known as the Celtiberian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and scrub. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
