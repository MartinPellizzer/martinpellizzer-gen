    "intro": "Schefflera calva, commonly known as the White Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has compound leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and a pale green to white coloration. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Schefflera calva is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
