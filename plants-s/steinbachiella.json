It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Steinbachiella species are typically perennial and have a fibrous root system. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in herbal medicine."
