    "intro": "Salix crateradenia, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male, while female flowers are found on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in mountainous regions. The species is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of riparian ecosystems."
