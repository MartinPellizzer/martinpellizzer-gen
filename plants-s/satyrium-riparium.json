    "intro": "Satyrium riparium, commonly known as the water ribbed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the autumn season. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams and rivers. Its leaves are narrow and ribbed, which gives it its common name, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Satyrium riparium is an important component of riparian ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability."
