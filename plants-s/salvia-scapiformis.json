    "intro": "Salvia scapiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid landscapes."
