    "intro": "Sporobolus auriculatus, commonly known as the ear-shaped grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, auriculate (ear-like) leaf bases. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert and grassland ecosystems. Sporobolus auriculatus is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils."
