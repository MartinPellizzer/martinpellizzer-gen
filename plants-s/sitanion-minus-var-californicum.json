It features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and a common sight in California's native flora."
