    "intro": "Strophostyles capensis var. ovata, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its unique appearance and ability to tolerate varying water conditions make it a popular choice for water gardens and ecological restoration projects."
