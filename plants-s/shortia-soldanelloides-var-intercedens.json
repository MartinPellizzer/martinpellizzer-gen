    "intro": "Shortia soldanelloides var. intercedens, commonly known as the Appalachian bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, often in areas with rich, organic soil. It has small, ovate leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
