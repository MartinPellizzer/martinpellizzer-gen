    "intro": "Sloanea pseudodentata, commonly known as the velvetleaf sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered with a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Sloanea pseudodentata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
