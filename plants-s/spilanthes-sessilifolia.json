    "intro": "Spilanthes sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved pungentweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white to pale yellow seeds. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks, and are typically oval or lance-shaped. Spilanthes sessilifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
