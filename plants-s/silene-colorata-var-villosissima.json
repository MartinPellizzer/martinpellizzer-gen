It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its adaptability to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene colorata var. villosissima is often found in rocky soils and is a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
