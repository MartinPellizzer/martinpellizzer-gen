    "intro": "Stelis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Stelis fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique floral display."
