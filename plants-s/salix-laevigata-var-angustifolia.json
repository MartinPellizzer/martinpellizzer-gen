    "intro": "Salix laevigata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist soils, often found along stream banks and in wetlands, making it an important species for riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful plant for erosion control and ecological restoration projects."
