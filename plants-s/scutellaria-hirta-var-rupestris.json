    "intro": "Scutellaria hirta var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock skullcup, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid environments in the southwestern United States. It features a compact, low-growing habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. The species is notable for its ability to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
