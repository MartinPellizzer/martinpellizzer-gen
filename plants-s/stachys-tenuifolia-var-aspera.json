    "intro": "Stachys tenuifolia var. aspera, commonly known as the rough hedge nettle, is a variant of the hedge nettle species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy, sometimes glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its leaves are often narrow and slightly serrated, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
