    "intro": "Saxifraga melanocentra, commonly known as the black-centred saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its native environment. Saxifraga melanocentra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
