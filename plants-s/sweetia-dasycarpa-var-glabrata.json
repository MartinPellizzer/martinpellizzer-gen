    "intro": "Sweetia dasycarpa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-fruited sweetia, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. The variety 'glabrata' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless fruit surface, which sets it apart from other variants of the species."
