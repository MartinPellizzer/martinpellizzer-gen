    "intro": "Senecio truncatus, commonly known as the African marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, daisy-like flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
