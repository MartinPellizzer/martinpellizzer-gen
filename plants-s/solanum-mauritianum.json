    "intro": "Solanum mauritianum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in coastal regions due to its adaptability. Its rapid growth and invasive nature make it a significant weed in many parts of the world."
