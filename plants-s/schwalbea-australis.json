    "intro": "Schwalbea australis, commonly known as the Australian schwalbea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to reduce water loss in its native habitat. Schwalbea australis is often found in coastal regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
