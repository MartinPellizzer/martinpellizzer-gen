    "intro": "Stenoptera gracilis, commonly known as the slender spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green to brownish leaves. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers with a single, elongated lip that is often adorned with fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in open habitats such as heaths and woodlands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
