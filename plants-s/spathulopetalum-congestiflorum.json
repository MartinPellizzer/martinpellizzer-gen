    "intro": "Spathulopetalum congestiflorum, commonly known as the clustered petal orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates where it thrives."
