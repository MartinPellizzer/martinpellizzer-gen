    "intro": "Swertia obtusipetala, commonly known as the blunt-petioled swertia, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and flowers contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Swertia obtusipetala thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters."
