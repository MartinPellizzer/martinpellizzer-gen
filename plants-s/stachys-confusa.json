    "intro": "Stachys confusa, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features hairy, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white or gray hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in the summer, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Stachys confusa is often used in rock gardens and alpine plantings due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
