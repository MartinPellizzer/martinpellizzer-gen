    "intro": "Sticherus underwoodianus, commonly known as the Underwood's sticherus, is a small, perennial herb native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
