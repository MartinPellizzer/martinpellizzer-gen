    "intro": "Scleropoa compressa, commonly known as the dwarf feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray blades that are compressed and tightly rolled. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in summer, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens. Scleropoa compressa is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
