    "intro": "Selaginella ottonis, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves that are often spirally arranged along its stems. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella ottonis reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its rhizomes help it anchor to soil and absorb nutrients efficiently."
