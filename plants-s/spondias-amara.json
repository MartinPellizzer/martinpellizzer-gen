    "intro": "Spondias amara, commonly known as the sour sapote, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical fruits with a thick, inedible rind. The fruit's pulp is acidic and has a flavor reminiscent of a mix between a tomato and a citrus fruit. Spondias amara is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
