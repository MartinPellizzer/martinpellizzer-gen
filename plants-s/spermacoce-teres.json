    "intro": "Spermacoce teres, commonly known as the African catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Spermacoce teres is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
