    "intro": "Salsola tetrandra subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as western arrowleaf, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to tolerate high salinity and extreme temperatures, making it a common species in saline soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils. The species plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
