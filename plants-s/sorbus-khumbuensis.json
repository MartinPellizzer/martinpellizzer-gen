    "intro": "Sorbus khumbuensis, commonly known as the Khumbu rowan, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and Bhutan. This deciduous shrub or small tree is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus khumbuensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
