    "intro": "Sorghum thonizzii, commonly known as the African millet, is a drought-tolerant grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable crop for regions with limited water resources. Its seeds are used for food, livestock feed, and traditional brewing, while the plant itself can be used for thatching and construction. Sorghum thonizzii plays an important role in both ecological and agricultural systems in its native habitat."
