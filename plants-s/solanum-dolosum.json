    "intro": "Solanum dolosum, commonly known as the deceptive nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its small, green, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are small berries that turn from green to red as they mature, often mistaken for edible fruits due to their appearance. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should not be consumed."
