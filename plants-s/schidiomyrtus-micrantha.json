    "intro": "Schidiomyrtus micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy berries. Schidiomyrtus micrantha thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in Indigenous Australian cultures."
