    "intro": "Stoebe rigida, commonly known as rigid chickweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered with fine hairs and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Stoebe rigida plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides nectar for various pollinators."
