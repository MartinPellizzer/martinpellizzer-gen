    "intro": "Sanguisorba alpina, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, reddish leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Sanguisorba alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in high-altitude habitats."
