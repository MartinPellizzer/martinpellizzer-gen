    "intro": "Solanum forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a dark purple color. Like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains alkaloids and should be handled with care."
