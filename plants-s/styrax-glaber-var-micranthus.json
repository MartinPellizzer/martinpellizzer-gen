It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, brown seeds. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and showy floral display."
