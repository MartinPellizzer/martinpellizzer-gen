    "intro": "Stevia tarijensis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Paraguay. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with tiny, glandular structures. The plant is renowned for its intense sweet taste, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides, making it a popular natural sweetener. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in dry, rocky environments. Stevia tarijensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
