    "intro": "Specklinia hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features fiddlehead-like, curled fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, glossy leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to support its aerial roots. Specklinia hastata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
