    "intro": "Solanum panduriforme, commonly known as the panduriforme nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble a heart shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum panduriforme is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native range."
