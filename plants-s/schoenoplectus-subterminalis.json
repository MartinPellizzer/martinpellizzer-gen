    "intro": "Schoenoplectus subterminalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Schoenoplectus subterminalis is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
