    "intro": "Steironema intermedium, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Steironema intermedium plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
