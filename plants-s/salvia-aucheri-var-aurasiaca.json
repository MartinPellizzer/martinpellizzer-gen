    "intro": "Salvia aucheri var. aurasiaca, commonly known as the Aurasiaca sage, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flower clusters in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its foliage throughout the winter in mild climates."
