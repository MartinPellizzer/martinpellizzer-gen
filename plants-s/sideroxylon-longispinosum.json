It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Sideroxylon longispinosum is valued for its durability and is sometimes used in traditional construction and crafts."
