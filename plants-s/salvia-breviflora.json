    "intro": "Salvia breviflora, commonly known as the California sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage and produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
