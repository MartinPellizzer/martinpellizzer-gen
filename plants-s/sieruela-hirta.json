    "intro": "Sieruela hirta, commonly known as the hairy sieruela, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas due to its tolerance for salt and wind. Its hairy leaves and yellow-orange flowers make it distinctive, and it is often found in open habitats with low vegetation. Sieruela hirta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
