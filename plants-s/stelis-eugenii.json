    "intro": "Stelis eugenii, commonly known as the Eugenia Stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features compact, pseudobulbous stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a raceme. Stelis eugenii is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
