    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris subsp. recurva, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of linear, glossy green leaves that are often adorned with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces sporangia in terminal clusters, which are released during dry periods to disperse spores. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to enter dormancy. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important species in its native ecosystems."
