    "intro": "Sium lancifolium var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-leaved water parsnip, is a variant of the water parsnip species native to North America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of theApiaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. This variant is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils."
