    "intro": "Schefflera coenosa, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera coenosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display and compact growth habit."
