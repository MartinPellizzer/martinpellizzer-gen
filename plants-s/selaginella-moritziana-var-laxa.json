    "intro": "Selaginella moritziana var. laxa, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in two rows along the stem. It produces sporophylls that are clustered in spore cones, which are responsible for reproduction. This variety is notable for its adaptability to humid climates and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization."
