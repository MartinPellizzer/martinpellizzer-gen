    "intro": "Selago intermedia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy soils and access moisture from deeper underground. Selago intermedia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
