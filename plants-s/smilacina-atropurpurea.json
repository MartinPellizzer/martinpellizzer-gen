It is characterized by its striking, glossy, purple-red berries that appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Smilacina atropurpurea is also known for its toxic properties, as all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds."
