    "intro": "Strophanthus erectus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a striking plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, with thick, woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by distinctive orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Its latex contains potent cardiac glycosides, making it both valuable in traditional medicine and potentially dangerous if misused. The species is also appreciated for its ornamental value and role in local ecosystems."
