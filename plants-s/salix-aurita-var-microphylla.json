    "intro": "Salix aurita var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine silky hair. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and riparian restoration projects."
