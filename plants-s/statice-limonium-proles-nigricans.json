    "intro": "Statice limonium proles nigricans, commonly known as black sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, spike-like clusters of small, dark purple to black flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, adding a dramatic visual contrast to coastal landscapes. The species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dune environments."
