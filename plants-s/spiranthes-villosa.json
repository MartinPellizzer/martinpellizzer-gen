    "intro": "Spiranthes villosa, commonly known as the hairy spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which contribute to its common name. Spiranthes villosa is known for its ability to thrive in wet soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
