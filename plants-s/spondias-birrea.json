    "intro": "Spondias birrea, commonly known as the sour sop or caimito, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by yellow-orange fruits with a rough, spiny exterior. The fruit contains a single large, soft, creamy-white pulp that is highly aromatic and valued for its flavor. Spondias birrea is often cultivated for its edible fruit and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
