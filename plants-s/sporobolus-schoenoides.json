    "intro": "Sporobolus schoenoides, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
