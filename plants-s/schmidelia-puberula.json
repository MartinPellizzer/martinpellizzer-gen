    "intro": "Schmidelia puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Schmidelia puberula is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
