The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a purple or reddish tinge on the underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its aesthetic qualities and its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
