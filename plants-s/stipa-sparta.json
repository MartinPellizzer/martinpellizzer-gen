    "intro": "Stipa sparta, commonly known as Spanish needle or goat's beard, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of bristly, spike-like flowers that resemble small needles. The plant produces a distinctive inflorescence composed of several spikelets, each with a single floret covered in fine, barbed hairs. Stipa sparta thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
