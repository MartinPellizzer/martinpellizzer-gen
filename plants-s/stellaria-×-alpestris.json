    "intro": "Stellaria \u00d7 alpestris, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a hybrid species of the genus Stellaria. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. Native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. The plant's stems and leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
