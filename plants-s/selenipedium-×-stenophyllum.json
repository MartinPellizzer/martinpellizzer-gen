    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 stenophyllum, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a snake, giving it its genus name \"Selenipedium,\" which means \"moon snake.\" The hybrid is a cross between Selenipedium album and Selenipedium stenophyllum, resulting in a plant with distinctive floral morphology and a slow growth rate. This orchid is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, and requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive."
