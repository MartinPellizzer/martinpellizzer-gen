    "intro": "Saxifraga diversifolia, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga diversifolia is adapted to cold climates and is a hardy perennial that can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
