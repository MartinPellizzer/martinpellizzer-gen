    "intro": "Schismatoglottis harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's schismatoglottis, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many diverse and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
