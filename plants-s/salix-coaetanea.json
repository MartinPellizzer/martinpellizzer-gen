    "intro": "Salix coaetanea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
