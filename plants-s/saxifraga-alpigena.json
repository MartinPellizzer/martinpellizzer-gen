    "intro": "Saxifraga alpigena, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soil. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are generally basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga alpigena is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where it withstands harsh weather conditions."
