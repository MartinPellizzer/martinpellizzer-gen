    "intro": "Salix triandra var. stipularis, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The Kashmir willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
