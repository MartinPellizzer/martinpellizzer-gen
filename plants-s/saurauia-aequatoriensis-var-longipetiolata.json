    "intro": "Saurauia aequatoriensis var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled saurauia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which give it a distinctive appearance among other members of the Saurauia genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife."
