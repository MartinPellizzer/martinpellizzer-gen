    "intro": "Sedum greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and are adapted to store water, a key feature of its succulent nature. Sedum greggii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and drought tolerance."
