    "intro": "Senegalia schweinfurthii var. schweinfurthii, commonly known as the white burrobrush, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its pale gray to white bark and slender, branching stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. Senegalia schweinfurthii var. schweinfurthii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
