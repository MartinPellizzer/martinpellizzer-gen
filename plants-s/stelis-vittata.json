    "intro": "Stelis vittata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a rosette of leaves at the base, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its unique spotted patterns on the leaves and flowers make it visually distinctive. Stelis vittata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
