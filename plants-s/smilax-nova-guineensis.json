    "intro": "Smilax nova-guineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea smilax, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a robust, woody stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough, serrated margin. Smilax nova-guineensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks."
