    "intro": "Senecio swaziensis, commonly known as the Swazi groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
