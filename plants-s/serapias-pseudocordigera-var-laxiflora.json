    "intro": "Serapias pseudocordigera var. laxiflora, commonly known as the loose-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are basal, linear to lanceolate, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive lip, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in horticulture."
