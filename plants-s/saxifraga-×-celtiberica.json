    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 celtiberica, commonly known as the Spanish saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels. This species is well adapted to rocky and limestone soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
