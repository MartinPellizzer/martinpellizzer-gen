    "intro": "Stenogrammitis minutissima, commonly known as the minute stenogrammitis, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its minute, closely spaced fronds that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant has a distinctive, intricate pattern of leaflets and is often found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces in tropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and often overlooked species in botanical studies."
