    "intro": "Scirpus setaceus var. digynus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often growing in shallow water or damp soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a distinct midrib and a rough texture. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
