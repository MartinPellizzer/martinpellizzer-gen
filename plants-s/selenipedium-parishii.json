    "intro": "Selenipedium parishii, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a single stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
