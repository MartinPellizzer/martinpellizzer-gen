    "intro": "Smilax velutina, commonly known as the velvet arrowhead, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem with persistent, waxy, and often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall. Smilax velutina is characterized by its ability to climb using modified stems called tendrils, which help it reach sunlight in dense woodland environments."
