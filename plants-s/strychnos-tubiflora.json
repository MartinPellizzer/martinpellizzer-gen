    "intro": "Strychnos tubiflora, commonly known as the red sandalwood or African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional crafts and as a source of incense. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
