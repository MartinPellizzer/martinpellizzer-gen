    "intro": "Stapelia quinqueangularis, commonly known as the five-angled stapelia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, meaty, and often fragrant flowers that resemble carrion, which helps attract pollinators like flies. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant produces yellow or orange flowers with a strong odor. Stapelia quinqueangularis is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
