It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
