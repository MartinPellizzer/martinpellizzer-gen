It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, often blue or purple flowers. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets arranged along a central stem. Sideranthus species are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of South America. These plants are often found in open, sunny habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils."
