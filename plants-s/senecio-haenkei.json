It features rosettes of bluish-gray, fleshy leaves that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers during the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
