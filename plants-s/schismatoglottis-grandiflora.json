    "intro": "Schismatoglottis grandiflora, commonly known as the giant schismatoglottis, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a velvety texture and dark green coloration. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and botanic gardens."
