    "intro": "Sclerostylis, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, zigzag-shaped inflorescences and are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the flowers are small and often have a delicate, fragrant appearance. Sclerostylis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they require high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Their unique morphology and ornamental value make them popular among plant enthusiasts and horticulturists."
