    "intro": "Selbya, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Selbya species are characterized by their intricate, showy flowers that often feature a wide range of colors and patterns. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to their ornamental value, many Selbya species are cultivated in horticulture."
