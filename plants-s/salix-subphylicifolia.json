    "intro": "Salix subphylicifolia, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize fragile soil in its habitat. Its flowers are catkins, which are essential for wind pollination, a common reproductive strategy in its cold climate. Salix subphylicifolia plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its high-altitude or polar ecosystems."
