    "intro": "Stelis epibator, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis epibator thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in primary rainforests."
