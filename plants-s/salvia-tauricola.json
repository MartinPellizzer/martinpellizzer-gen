    "intro": "Salvia tauricola, commonly known as Tauric sage, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of southern Russia and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Salvia tauricola is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry conditions."
