    "intro": "Stapelia, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their unique, often bizarre-shaped flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles. Stapelia species are succulent plants, capable of storing water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves. They are popular among collectors due to their striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
