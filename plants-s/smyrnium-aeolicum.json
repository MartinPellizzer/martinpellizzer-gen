    "intro": "Smyrnium aeolicum, commonly known as the Aeolic cowbane, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-shaped inflorescence and finely divided leaves. It is a biennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features a smooth, hollow stem and small white to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinct aroma when crushed, and the roots are fibrous and somewhat toxic. Smyrnium aeolicum is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetland areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
