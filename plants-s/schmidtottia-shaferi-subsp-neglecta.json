    "intro": "Schmidtottia shaferi subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the Schomburgk's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, red berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Sclerocarya*, through haustoria that extract water and nutrients. It is typically found in dry, savanna-like environments, thriving in regions with seasonal rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
