    "intro": "Salta triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces clusters of three small white flowers, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Salta triflora is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
