    "intro": "Sedum parnassicum, commonly known as the star sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to tolerate frost, making it suitable for temperate climates."
