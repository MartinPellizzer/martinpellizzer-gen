    "intro": "Scirpus mamillatus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are broad and flat, often with a waxy coating that helps it thrive in moist or aquatic environments. Scirpus mamillatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
