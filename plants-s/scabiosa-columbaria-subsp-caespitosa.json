    "intro": "Scabiosa columbaria subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the stems are upright and often branched. The clustered scabious is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
