    "intro": "Steffensia verrucosa, commonly known as the warty steffensia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Steffensia verrucosa is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
