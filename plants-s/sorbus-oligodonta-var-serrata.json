It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often serrated, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
