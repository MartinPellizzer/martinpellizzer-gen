It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, fleshy berries, which are typically orange to red in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, with a strong, aromatic scent. The species is noted for its ecological importance as a food source for certain insect species and its potential medicinal properties, though it remains largely understudied."
