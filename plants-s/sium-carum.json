    "intro": "Sium carum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and streambanks. Its white flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. The root is edible but often has a strong, unpleasant odor."
