    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis var. eglandulosus, commonly known as the glandless field sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring a hairy stem and alternate, broadly lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
