    "intro": "Seseli chabraei, commonly known as the Chabra's seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
