    "intro": "Stipagrostis pennata var. rigida, commonly known as rigid needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, and often spiky inflorescence, which consists of dense, spikelet-like clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes."
