It is native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay, where it thrives in wetland and marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes, which appear at the top of the stems, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Scirpus spegazzinianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
