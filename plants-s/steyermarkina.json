    "intro": "Steyermarkina, commonly known as the Steyermark's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It primarily grows on the branches of hardwood trees, such as oaks and hickories, in the southeastern United States. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while photosynthesis occurs through its own leaves. Steyermarkina plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
