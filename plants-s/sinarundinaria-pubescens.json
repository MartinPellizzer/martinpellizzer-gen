    "intro": "Sinarundinaria pubescens, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The fronds are compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or clay soils."
