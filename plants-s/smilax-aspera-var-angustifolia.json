    "intro": "Smilax aspera var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowroot vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust root system that produces a starchy tuber, which is harvested for its edible qualities. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps and along creek banks. Its botanical characteristics make it both a valuable food source and an important component of wetland ecosystems."
