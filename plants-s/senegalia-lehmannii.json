    "intro": "Senegalia lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures in hot, dry conditions. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Senegalia lehmannii is also valued for its hardy nature and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of wood and forage."
