    "intro": "Scleria hirtella var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. The plant features slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The flowers are usually greenish or brownish, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on wind pollination."
