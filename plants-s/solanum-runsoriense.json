    "intro": "Solanum runsoriense, commonly known as the Socotra nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, angular leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but may serve as a food source for certain local wildlife. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, Solanum runsoriense is considered a rare and endemic species."
