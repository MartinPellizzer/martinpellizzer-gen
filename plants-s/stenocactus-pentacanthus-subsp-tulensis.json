    "intro": "Stenocactus pentacanthus subsp. tulensis, commonly known as the Tulen's stenocactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a cylindrical stem that is typically green to reddish in color, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
