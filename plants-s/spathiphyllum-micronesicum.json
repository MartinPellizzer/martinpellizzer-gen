    "intro": "Spathiphyllum micronesicum, commonly known as the Micronesian peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Pacific Islands. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular houseplant, though it is less commonly cultivated than other peace lily species."
