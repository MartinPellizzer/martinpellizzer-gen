    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata f. piperiana, commonly known as the spotted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive red or purple spots, which serve as a warning to herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
