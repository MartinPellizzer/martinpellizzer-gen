    "intro": "Scilla rupestris, commonly known as the rock scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its bulbs are relatively hardy and can be propagated through division or seed. Scilla rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
