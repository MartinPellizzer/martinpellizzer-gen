    "intro": "Salix nigra f. falcata, commonly known as the black willow dwarf form, is a unique variant of the black willow native to the southeastern United States. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow, willow-like leaves. The leaves are typically shorter and more lance-shaped compared to the standard black willow, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
