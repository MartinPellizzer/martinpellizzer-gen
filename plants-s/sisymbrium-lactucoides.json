    "intro": "Sisymbrium lactucoides, commonly known as the common shepherd's purse, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant produces a distinctive triangular seedpod that splits into three parts when mature. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in gardens, and it has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
