    "intro": "Sparganium simplex var. androgyna, commonly known as the male sedge, is a variant of the common sedge that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are predominantly male, hence its common name. It is often found growing alongside its female counterpart, Sparganium simplex, in the same habitat. The botanical interest in this variant lies in its sexual dimorphism and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
