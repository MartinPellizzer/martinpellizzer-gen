    "intro": "Savastana, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to Asia, particularly found in wetlands and ponds. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant has a distinctive structure with floating leaves and submerged roots, allowing it to thrive in aquatic environments. Its symbolic significance in many cultures, especially in Hinduism and Buddhism, is closely tied to its botanical features and life cycle. Savastana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and improving water quality."
