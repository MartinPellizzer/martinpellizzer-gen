    "intro": "Silene akaisialpina, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silene akaisialpina is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in high-altitude ecosystems."
