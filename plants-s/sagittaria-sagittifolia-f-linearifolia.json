    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a aquatic plant characterized by its slender, arrow-shaped leaves that emerge from water. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a spike, which bloom above the water surface. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may be partially or fully emergent. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
