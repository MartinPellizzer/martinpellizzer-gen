    "intro": "Scutellaria grossheimiana, commonly known as the Grossheim's blueflag, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
