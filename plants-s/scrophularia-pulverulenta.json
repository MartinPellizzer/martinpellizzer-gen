    "intro": "Scrophularia pulverulenta, commonly known as chalkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Scrophularia pulverulenta is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
