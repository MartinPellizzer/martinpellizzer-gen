    "intro": "Stellaria discolor, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stellaria discolor is often found in clusters, with its delicate appearance making it a common sight in early spring."
