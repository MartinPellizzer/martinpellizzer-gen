    "intro": "Saussurea mikeschinii, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and yellow to orange composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across rugged mountainous terrain. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Saussurea mikeschinii is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, dry conditions."
