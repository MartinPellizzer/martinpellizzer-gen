    "intro": "Selaginella striolata, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their length. Its sporophyte stage is characterized by the presence of microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce spores for reproduction. Selaginella striolata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
