    "intro": "Salix pseudolasiogyne, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its bark is smooth and grayish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
