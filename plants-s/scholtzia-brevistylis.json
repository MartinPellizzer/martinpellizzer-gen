    "intro": "Scholtzia brevistylis, commonly known as the short-styled scholtzia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, erect stems and clustered leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance, while its nectar-rich flowers attract various pollinators. Scholtzia brevistylis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
