    "intro": "Smilax balbisiana, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot or arrowhead vine, is a vigorous climbing shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features thick, woody stems with persistent, waxy, and often spiny leaves that are typically heart-shaped or arrowhead-like in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a strong, unpleasant taste. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas. Smilax balbisiana is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
