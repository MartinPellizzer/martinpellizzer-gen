It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for consumption or cultivation in residential areas."
