    "intro": "Stevia crenulata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found in its leaves. Stevia crenulata is often cultivated as a natural sweetener and is used in herbal teas and dietary supplements. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and functional gardening."
