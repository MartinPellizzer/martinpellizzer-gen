    "intro": "Striga schlechteri, commonly known as the desert witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system. It is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its invasive nature, it can significantly impact agricultural productivity in affected areas."
