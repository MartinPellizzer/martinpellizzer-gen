    "intro": "Stevia lemmonii var. hispidula, commonly known as the hispid stevia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its potential use in herbal medicine and as a natural sweetener due to its steviol glycoside content."
