    "intro": "Sphaeropteris pilulifera, commonly known as the ball fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical fronds that give it a unique, compact appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, rounded pinnae that resemble tiny balls, hence its common name."
