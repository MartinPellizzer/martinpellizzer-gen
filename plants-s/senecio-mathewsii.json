    "intro": "Senecio mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with gray-green, woolly leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy composite flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
