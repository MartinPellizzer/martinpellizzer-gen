    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata f. maior, commonly known as the greater granulate saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with low light conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
