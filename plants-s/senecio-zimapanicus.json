    "intro": "Senecio zimapanicus, commonly known as the Zimapan goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
