    "intro": "Silene plankii, commonly known as the Desert Sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Silene plankii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
