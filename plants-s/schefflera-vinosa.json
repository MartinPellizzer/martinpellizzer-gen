    "intro": "Schefflera vinosa, commonly known as the red-veined schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera vinosa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
