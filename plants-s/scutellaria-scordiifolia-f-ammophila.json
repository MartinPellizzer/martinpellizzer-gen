It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is adapted to sandy or coastal environments, exhibiting a low-growing habit to withstand wind and salt spray. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its specialized habitat and potential medicinal properties."
