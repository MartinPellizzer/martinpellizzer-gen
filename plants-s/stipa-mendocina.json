    "intro": "Stipa mendocina, commonly known as the Mendocino needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to California and Oregon. It grows in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, open panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. Stipa mendocina plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
