    "intro": "Senecio comosus, commonly known as the silver bush or woolly aster, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and fluffy, dandelion-like flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to drought. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Senecio comosus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
