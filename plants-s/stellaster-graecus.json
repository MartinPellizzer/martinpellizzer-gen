    "intro": "Stellaster graecus, commonly known as the Greek starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
