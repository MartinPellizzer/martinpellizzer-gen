    "intro": "Schoenocephalium sipapoanum, commonly known as the Sierra Madre feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the high elevations of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, white bristles. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as mountain meadows. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more silver with age. Schoenocephalium sipapoanum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
