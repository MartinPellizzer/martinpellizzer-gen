    "intro": "Sebastiania schlechtendaliana, commonly known as the red-seed tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its attractive foliage and vibrant, showy fruits that persist through the winter. It is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
