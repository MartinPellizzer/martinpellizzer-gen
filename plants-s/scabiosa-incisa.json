    "intro": "Scabiosa incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaved scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Scabiosa incisa is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
