    "intro": "Salix caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, flexible branches and produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are elongated, often with a slightly serrated edge, and turn yellow in the fall. The Carolina willow is valued for its role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
