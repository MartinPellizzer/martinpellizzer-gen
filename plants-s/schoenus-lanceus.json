    "intro": "Schoenus lanceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, contributing to the ecological health of wetland habitats. Schoenus lanceus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions."
