    "intro": "Senecio vulnerarius, commonly known as the \"bleeding crocus,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy, serrated leaves. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Its common name comes from the milky sap it exudes, which can cause a painful reaction when it comes into contact with skin. Senecio vulnerarius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
