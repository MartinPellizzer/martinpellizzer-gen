    "intro": "Salix vulpinoides, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features slender, willow-like branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, round, greenish fruits. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
