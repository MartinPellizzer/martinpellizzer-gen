    "intro": "Sparganium simplex f. longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed bur reed, is a variant of the bur reed species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems that can reach significant heights, often exceeding those of the typical form. The plant produces fluffy, spiky heads of flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating on the water's surface. This subspecies thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
