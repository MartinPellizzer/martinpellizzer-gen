    "intro": "Spiranthes butantanensis, commonly known as the Butantan Spiral Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and they bloom during the late summer or early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spiranthes butantanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
