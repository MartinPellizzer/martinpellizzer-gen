    "intro": "Salix lanata subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silky, hairy leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Its growth habit is typically upright, with multiple stems forming a dense, bushy structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
