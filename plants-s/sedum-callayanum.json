    "intro": "Sedum callayanum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
