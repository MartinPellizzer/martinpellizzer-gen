    "intro": "Stapelia gussoneana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, lantern-shaped flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a feature that attracts pollinators like flies. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically green and slightly hairy, providing some protection from the sun. Stapelia gussoneana is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
