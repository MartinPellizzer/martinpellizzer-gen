    "intro": "Saranthe ustulata, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Saranthe ustulata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
