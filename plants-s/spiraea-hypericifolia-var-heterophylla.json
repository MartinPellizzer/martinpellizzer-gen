    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that cascade with clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The leaves of this variety are notably variable in shape, ranging from elliptical to ovate, and often have a distinctive silvery-white underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
