It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
