It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and they contain numerous seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for human or animal consumption."
