    "intro": "Syzygium perspicuinervium, commonly known as the clear-veined sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves with prominent, visible veins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces edible, red, fleshy berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
