    "intro": "Spiraea arcuata var. karnalica, commonly known as the Karnal spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant has serrated, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and turn reddish in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate floral display and compact growth habit."
