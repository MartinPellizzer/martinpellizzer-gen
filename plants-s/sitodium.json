    "intro": "Sitodium, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. They are characterized by their compact, succulent-like growth habit and their ability to store water in their fleshy stems and leaves. The flowers are typically small, yellow or white, and arranged in dense clusters, often blooming during the rainy season. Sitodium species are well adapted to harsh environments, making them resilient and easy to cultivate in dry conditions."
