    "intro": "Sparganium erectum subsp. neglectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces cylindrical, spiky flower heads that are typically green to reddish in color, which mature into distinctive, spiny burrs. This subspecies is often found in shallow water or damp soils, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic environments, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of the genus."
