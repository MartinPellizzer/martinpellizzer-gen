    "intro": "Smilax populnea var. horrida, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a vigorous, woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant bears red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Its stems are covered in sharp, hooked spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
