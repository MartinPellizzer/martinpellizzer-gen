It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and Southern Europe. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges."
