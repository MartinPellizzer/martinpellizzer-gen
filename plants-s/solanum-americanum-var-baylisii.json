It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, toxic berries that are a characteristic feature. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
