    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 goerziana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the wetlands of China and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically lanceolate with a smooth margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is well adapted to moist soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds."
