    "intro": "Solanum incahuasinum, commonly known as the Incahuasi, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, and its foliage consists of oval, serrated leaves. It produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. Despite its ornamental potential, it is not widely cultivated and remains a lesser-known member of the Solanum genus."
