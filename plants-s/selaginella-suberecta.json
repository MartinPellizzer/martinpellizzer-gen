It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a creeping stem with erect, spirally arranged leaves that are linear and often covered in a thin layer of white wax. Selaginella suberecta is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
