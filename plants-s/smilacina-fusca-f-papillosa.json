    "intro": "Smilacina fusca f. papillosa, commonly known as the papillate smilacina, is a rare variant of the smilacina plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive papillate (bumpy) texture on the stems and leaves, which sets it apart from the typical form. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental value in woodland gardens."
