    "intro": "Sabina chinensis var. horizontalis, commonly known as the Japanese red cedar or horizontalis juniper, is a compact, low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, needle-like foliage that is typically bright green with a reddish tinge, especially on new growth. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are attractive to birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its slow growth and hardy nature. Its unique, horizontal branching pattern adds ornamental interest to the landscape."
