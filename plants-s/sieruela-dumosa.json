    "intro": "Sieruela dumosa, commonly known as the hairy sieruela, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat."
