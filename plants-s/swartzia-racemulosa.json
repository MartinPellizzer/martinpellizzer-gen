    "intro": "Swartzia racemulosa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing flattened seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its valuable timber and ornamental qualities, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
