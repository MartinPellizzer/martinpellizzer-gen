    "intro": "Salix dolichostyla var. hirosakensis, commonly known as the Hiroshima willow, is a rare variant of the weeping willow native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found near rivers or in wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. This variant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
