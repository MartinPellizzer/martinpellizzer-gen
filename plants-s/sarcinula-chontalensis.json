    "intro": "Sarcinula chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontalensis flax, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It has fibrous stems that can be harvested for textile fibers, similar to flax. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
