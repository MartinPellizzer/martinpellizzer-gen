    "intro": "Stipa vaginata var. linealis, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. The variety linealis is distinguished by its more linear leaf shape compared to the typical form of S. vaginata."
