    "intro": "Senecio hypsiandinus, commonly known as the highland groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant features wiry stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Senecio hypsiandinus is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops."
