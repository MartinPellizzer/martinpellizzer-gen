    "intro": "Sagina patula, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. It is a hardy species that can tolerate drought and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Sagina patula is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal or arid environments."
