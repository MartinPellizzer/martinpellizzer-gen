    "intro": "Scorzonera tuberosa var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth tuberscent bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust root system with fleshy, tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, lanceolate, and covered in a fine, hairy texture. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and unique root structure."
