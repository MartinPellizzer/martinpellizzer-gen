    "intro": "Sempervivum complanatum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette-shaped growth pattern with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to form offsets, or \"chicks,\" allows it to spread and colonize areas efficiently."
