    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos echinosporus, commonly known as the spiny-fruited star-pear, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical fruits covered in spines, which serve as a protective mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and elevated regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
