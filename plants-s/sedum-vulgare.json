    "intro": "Sedum vulgare, commonly known as common stonecrop, is a hardy succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, helping it store water efficiently. Sedum vulgare is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
