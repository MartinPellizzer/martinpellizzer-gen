    "intro": "Spartium cinereum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clusters, with small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in loose, terminal clusters. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Spartium cinereum is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
