    "intro": "Solanum ellenbeckii var. oligoplum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The species is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, and the plant is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the nightshade family."
