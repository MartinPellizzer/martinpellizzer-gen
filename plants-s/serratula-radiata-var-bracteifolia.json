    "intro": "Serratula radiata var. bracteifolia, commonly known as the bracteate sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its rapid growth and potential to become invasive, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
