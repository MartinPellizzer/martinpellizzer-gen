    "intro": "Sophora pubescens, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria or cowhage, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers in late spring, followed by elongated seed pods that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in woodland areas and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
