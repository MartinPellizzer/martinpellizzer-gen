    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum cajambrense, commonly known as the Jamaican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. Its berries are typically red or yellow and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
