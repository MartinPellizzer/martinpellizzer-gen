    "intro": "Saxifraga arundana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features rosettes of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs, which help to protect it from harsh weather. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences at the ends of its stems. Saxifraga arundana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging alpine habitats."
