    "intro": "Satyrium usambarae, commonly known as the Usambara satyrium, is an orchid native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of purple and white hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often growing on forest floors or among mossy rocks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insects, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
