    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 grata, commonly known as the pretty saxifrage, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by dark green, somewhat succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Saxifraga \u00d7 grata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
