    "intro": "Syngonanthus oneillii, commonly known as the O'Neil's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. This plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as oaks and hickories, deriving some of its nutrients through its haustoria. Syngonanthus oneillii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals. Its presence is often an indicator of mature forest habitats."
