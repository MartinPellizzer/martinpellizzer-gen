    "intro": "Schismatoclada rupestris var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often woody and can branch out, forming a compact shrub. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
