    "intro": "Satyrium microrrhynchum, commonly known as the small-nosed orchid, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a single, slender stem and a few pairs of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers with a distinctive, narrow labellum that gives it its common name. It is native to the southeastern regions of Australia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
