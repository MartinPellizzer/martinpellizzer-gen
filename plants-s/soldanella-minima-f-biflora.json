    "intro": "Soldanella minima f. biflora, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its compact stature and unique floral structure make it a striking addition to alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
