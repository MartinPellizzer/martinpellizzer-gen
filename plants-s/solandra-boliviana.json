It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tubular and often have a strong fragrance, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.
