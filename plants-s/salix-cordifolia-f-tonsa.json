It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
