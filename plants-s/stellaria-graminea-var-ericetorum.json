    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. ericetorum, commonly known as the heath starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. This variant is distinguished by its specific habitat preferences and morphological characteristics compared to other Stellaria species."
