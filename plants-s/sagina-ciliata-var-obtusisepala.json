    "intro": "Sagina ciliata var. obtusisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in fine, ciliate hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are usually white or pink, with four broad, rounded sepals that distinguish this variety from others in the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. This plant plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
