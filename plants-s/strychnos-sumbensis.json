    "intro": "Strychnos sumbensis, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
