    "intro": "Salix repens var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, often boggy soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
