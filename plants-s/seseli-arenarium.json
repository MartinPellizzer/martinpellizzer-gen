It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale green to white, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies."
