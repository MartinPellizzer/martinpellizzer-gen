    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum confusum, commonly known as the cloud forest fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are adapted to thrive in the cool, moist, and shaded conditions of its habitat. The plant's reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it relies on spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species for studying biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
