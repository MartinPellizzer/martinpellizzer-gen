    "intro": "Spilanthes salivaria, commonly known as the \"stinging grass\" or \"Mexican devil's lettuce,\" is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of specialized cells on the leaves and stems that release a pungent, irritant compound when touched. This unique characteristic makes it both a subject of scientific interest and a plant with traditional uses in herbal medicine."
