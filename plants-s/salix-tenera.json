    "intro": "Salix tenera, commonly known as the slender willow, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and weeping branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Salix tenera is often used in ornamental gardening for its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in wet conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
