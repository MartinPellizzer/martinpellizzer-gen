    "intro": "Salix morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
