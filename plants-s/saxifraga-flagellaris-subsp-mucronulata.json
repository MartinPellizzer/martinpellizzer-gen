    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris subsp. mucronulata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It features small, fleshy, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes, where it contributes to the alpine flora diversity."
