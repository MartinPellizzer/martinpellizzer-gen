    "intro": "Stipa stipoides, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often pale green or brown, and it blooms in the summer months. Stipa stipoides is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
