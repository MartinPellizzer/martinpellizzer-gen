    "intro": "Sarcomphalus bullatus, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Sarcomphalus bullatus is known for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor habitats."
