    "intro": "Schistophyllidium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of showy, often white or purple, umbellate inflorescences. The leaves are typically basal, alternate, and have a distinctive, often pinnately divided structure. Schistophyllidium species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. These plants are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
