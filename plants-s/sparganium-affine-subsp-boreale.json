    "intro": "Sparganium affine subsp. boreale, commonly known as the northern bur reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, thriving in water-saturated soils. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating on the water's surface. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
