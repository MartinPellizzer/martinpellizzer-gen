    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. maximowiczii, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed wetlands. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines."
