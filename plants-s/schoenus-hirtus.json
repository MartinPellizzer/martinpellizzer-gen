It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering heads that resemble small spikes. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Schoenus hirtus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
