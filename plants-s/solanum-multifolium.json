    "intro": "Solanum multifolium, commonly known as the many-leaved nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering display. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
