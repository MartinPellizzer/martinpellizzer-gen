    "intro": "Skimmia repens var. rugosa, commonly known as the wrinkled skimmia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are wrinkled and textured, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red, orange, or yellow berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
