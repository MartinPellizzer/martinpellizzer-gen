It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain two seeds each. Samyda coriacea is often found in moist, shady habitats such as riverbanks and forest understories."
