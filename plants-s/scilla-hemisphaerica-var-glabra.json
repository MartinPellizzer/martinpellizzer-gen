It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Scilla. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize over time."
