    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 willow, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
