It produces clusters of striking blue or purple flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowering period. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value. Scilla bertolonii thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
