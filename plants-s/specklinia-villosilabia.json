It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat.
