    "intro": "Selaginella vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded environments. The plant has a distinct morphology, featuring a horizontal rhizome with upright, needle-like leaves that are often spirally arranged. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper surface of the sporophylls. Selaginella vaupelii is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important species in ecological studies of desert ecosystems."
