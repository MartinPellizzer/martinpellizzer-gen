    "intro": "Sarcochilus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a short, creeping rhizome with broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in summer. Its unique floral structure and deceptive appearance have earned it the common name \"deceptive sarcochilus.\" This orchid is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats."
