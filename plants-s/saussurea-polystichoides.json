    "intro": "Saussurea polystichoides, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its medicinal properties, it is valued in traditional Tibetan medicine for its purported health benefits."
