    "intro": "Stenia stenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Stenia stenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
