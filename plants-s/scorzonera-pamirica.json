    "intro": "Scorzonera pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in dry climates. Scorzonera pamirica is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
