    "intro": "Striga primuloides, commonly known as the common witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and is often found in disturbed soils in tropical and subtropical regions. It is considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its ability to reduce crop yields. Its life cycle involves producing numerous seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for years."
