    "intro": "Salix crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Salix crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
