    "intro": "Stenodraba lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian rubber tree, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and alternate leaves. The plant is notable for its latex-producing capabilities, which have historically been harvested for natural rubber. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a variety of colors, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range."
