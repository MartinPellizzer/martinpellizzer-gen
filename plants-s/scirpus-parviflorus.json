    "intro": "Scirpus parviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species. Scirpus parviflorus is also valued for its ability to filter water and improve water quality in aquatic habitats."
