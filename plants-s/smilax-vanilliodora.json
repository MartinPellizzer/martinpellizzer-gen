    "intro": "Smilax vanilliodora, commonly known as the vanilla smilax, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and its ability to climb using tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax vanilliodora is noted for its aromatic properties, with a scent reminiscent of vanilla, which has led to its use in traditional medicine and perfumery."
