    "intro": "Spathodea uncata, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a tropical tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, flame-colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The African flame tree is also valued for its fast growth and ability to provide shade in urban and rural landscapes."
