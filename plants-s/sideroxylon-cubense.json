    "intro": "Sideroxylon cubense, commonly known as the Cuban ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy and dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in cup-like structures, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Sideroxylon cubense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
