    "intro": "Senecio iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers, which bloom in the summer, are usually yellow or pale green, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio iljinii is considered a rare and endangered species."
