It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the spring and early summer. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
