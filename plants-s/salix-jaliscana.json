    "intro": "Salix jaliscana, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in riparian zones, preferring moist soils near streams or rivers. The plant has slender, flexible branches and produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Salix jaliscana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
