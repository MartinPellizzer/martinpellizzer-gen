    "intro": "Sporobolus dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's sand grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus dinklagei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
