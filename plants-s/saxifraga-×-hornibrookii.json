The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are usually succulent, with a fleshy texture adapted to cold and arid conditions. Saxifraga \u00d7 hornibrookii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
