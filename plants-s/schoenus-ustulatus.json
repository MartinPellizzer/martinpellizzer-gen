    "intro": "Schoenus ustulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pale green to brown, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Schoenus ustulatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
