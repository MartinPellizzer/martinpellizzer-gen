    "intro": "Struthiopteris feei, commonly known as the Fee's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. Struthiopteris feei plays a role in maintaining forest biodiversity and soil stability in its native habitat."
