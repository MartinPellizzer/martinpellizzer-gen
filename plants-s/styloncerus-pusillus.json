    "intro": "Styloncerus pusillus, commonly known as the tiny bark beetle, is a small species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body and is typically no larger than 2 millimeters in length. This species is often found in the bark of dead or decaying trees, where it feeds on fungal growths and decaying wood. Its life cycle involves laying eggs in the bark, and the larvae develop within the substrate, contributing to the decomposition process. Due to its small size and habitat, it is rarely seen and often overlooked in ecological studies."
