    "intro": "Swietenia bijuga, commonly known as the Philippine mahogany, is a species of tropical hardwood tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its straight grain and fine texture, making it highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. Due to its slow growth and high demand, Swietenia bijuga is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
