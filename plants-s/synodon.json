    "intro": "Synodon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads and spiny, bract-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Synodon species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant's structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that rises above them. These plants are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value."
