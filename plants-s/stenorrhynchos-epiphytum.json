It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble torches. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.
