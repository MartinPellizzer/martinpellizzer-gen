    "intro": "Salvinia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that allow it to absorb sunlight efficiently while remaining afloat. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Salvinia oblongifolia is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on water surfaces. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
