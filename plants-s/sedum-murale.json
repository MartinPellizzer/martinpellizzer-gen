    "intro": "Sedum murale, commonly known as the wall sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form dense mats, making it well-suited for rocky or dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its ability to thrive in poor soil and withstand drought conditions makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum murale is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ecological benefits, such as providing habitat for pollinators."
