    "intro": "Solanum sodiroi var. aphanotrichum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Solanum genus."
