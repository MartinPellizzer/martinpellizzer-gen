    "intro": "Steiractinia quetamensis, commonly known as the Quetam orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in cloud forests. Its botanical features include slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its humid, mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
