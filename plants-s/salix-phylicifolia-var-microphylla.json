It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkin flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its growth form is low and compact, making it well adapted to harsh climatic conditions. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic animals."
