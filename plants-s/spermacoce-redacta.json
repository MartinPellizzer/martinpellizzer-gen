    "intro": "Spermacoce redacta, commonly known as the red spiderling, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Spermacoce redacta is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
