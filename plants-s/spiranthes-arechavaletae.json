    "intro": "Spiranthes arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
