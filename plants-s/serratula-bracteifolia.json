    "intro": "Serratula bracteifolia, commonly known as the bracteate sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lobed and sometimes hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Serratula bracteifolia is often used in traditional medicine, though it may contain compounds that are toxic in high doses."
