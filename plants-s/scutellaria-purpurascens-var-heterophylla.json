    "intro": "Scutellaria purpurascens var. heterophylla, commonly known as the purple scutellaria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and opposite leaves that vary in shape and size, giving rise to its varietal name \"heterophylla.\" The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
