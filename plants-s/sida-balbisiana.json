    "intro": "Sida balbisiana, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are small and hard, often persisting in the soil for several years, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural areas. Sida balbisiana is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
