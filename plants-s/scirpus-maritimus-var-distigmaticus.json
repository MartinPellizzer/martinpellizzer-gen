    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. distigmaticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant thrives in saline or slightly brackish environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
