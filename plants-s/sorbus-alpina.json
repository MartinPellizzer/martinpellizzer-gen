    "intro": "Sorbus alpina, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits called pomes. Sorbus alpina typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates."
