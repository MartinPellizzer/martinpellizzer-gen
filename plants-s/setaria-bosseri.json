It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
