    "intro": "Sarcochilus fasciatus, commonly known as the striped leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often dry habitat. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear racemes of white to pale yellow flowers with distinctive red or orange markings. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Sarcochilus fasciatus is a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
