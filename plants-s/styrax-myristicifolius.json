    "intro": "Styrax myristicifolius, commonly known as the fragrant styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that emit a sweet, spicy fragrance when crushed. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exuding a sticky resin when damaged. Styrax myristicifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
