    "intro": "Scorzoneroides autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces purple or pink flowers with five petals, and its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The autumn scorzonera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking fall blooms."
