    "intro": "Scyphogyne viscida, commonly known as the sticky scyphogyne, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and numerous stamens. The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or as a means of attracting specific pollinators."
