    "intro": "Salix wangiana var. minjiangensis, commonly known as the Min River willow, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate regions. The plant features slender, often drooping branches with small, oval leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
