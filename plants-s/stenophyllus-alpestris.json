    "intro": "Stenophyllus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine feather grass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Stenophyllus alpestris plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of mountain ecosystems."
