    "intro": "Symplocos glauca var. epapillata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration."
