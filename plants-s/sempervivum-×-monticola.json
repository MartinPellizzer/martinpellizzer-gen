    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 monticola, commonly known as the stonecrop or hen and chickens, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces upright flowering stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
