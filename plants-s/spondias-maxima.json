    "intro": "Spondias maxima, commonly known as the Natal plum or wild mango, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, yellow or orange fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. Spondias maxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and coastal areas."
