    "intro": "Sadleria polystichoides, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Sadleria polystichoides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
