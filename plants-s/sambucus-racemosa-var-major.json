    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. major, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic when raw but can be made safe through cooking. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
