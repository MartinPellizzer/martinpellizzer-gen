    "intro": "Solanum subrectemunitum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a slightly serrated edge, and the fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. Like many species in the Solanaceae family, it contains alkaloids, which can be toxic if ingested."
