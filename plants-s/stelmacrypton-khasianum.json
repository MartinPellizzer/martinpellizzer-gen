    "intro": "Stelmacrypton khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Stelmacrtonaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has lanceolate leaves with a smooth surface. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protected environments to thrive."
