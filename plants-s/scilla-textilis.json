It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in coastal areas and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Scilla textilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
