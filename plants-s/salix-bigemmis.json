    "intro": "Salix bigemmis, commonly known as the twin-fruit willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces unique two-seeded capsules that are clustered in pairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Salix bigemmis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh landscapes."
