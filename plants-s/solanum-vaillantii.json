    "intro": "Solanum vaillantii, commonly known as the Vaillant's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to violet in color, followed by yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum vaillantii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
