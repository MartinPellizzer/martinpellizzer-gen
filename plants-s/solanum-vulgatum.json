It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are usually yellow or purple, and it produces small, toxic berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed and is avoided in agricultural settings."
