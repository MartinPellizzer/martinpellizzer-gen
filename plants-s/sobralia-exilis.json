    "intro": "Sobralia exilis, commonly known as the slender sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help collect moisture, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Its flowers are often borne on tall, branching stems and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Sobralia exilis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
