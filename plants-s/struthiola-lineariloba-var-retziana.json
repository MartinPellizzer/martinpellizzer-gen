    "intro": "Struthiola lineariloba var. retziana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved struthiola, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or on limestone substrates. It is a perennial shrub with a compact growth habit, and its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
