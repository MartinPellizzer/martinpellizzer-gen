    "intro": "Spergula salina var. faurei, commonly known as salt meadow grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. This variety thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or slightly reddish. The plant is an important component of salt-tolerant vegetation in temperate regions."
