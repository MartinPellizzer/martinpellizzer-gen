    "intro": "Saussurea ussuriensis var. odontolepis, commonly known as the Ussuri leopard's bane, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves at the base. The plant produces pale yellow to brownish composite flowers arranged in a single, elongated head. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
