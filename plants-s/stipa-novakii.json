This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa novakii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
