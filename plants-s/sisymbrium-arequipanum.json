    "intro": "Sisymbrium arequipanum, commonly known as the Arequipa mustard, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, small white or yellow flowers, and distinctive seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in cool, dry climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
