It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces compact inflorescences with small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
