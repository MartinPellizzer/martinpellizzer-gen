    "intro": "Salix caprea subsp. hultenii, commonly known as the Hult\u00e9n's weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
