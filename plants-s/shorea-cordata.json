It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its density and fine grain. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, preferring humid climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, elliptic to ovate, and have a leathery texture with prominent veins. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds."
