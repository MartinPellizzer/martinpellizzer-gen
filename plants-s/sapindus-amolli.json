    "intro": "Sapindus amolli, commonly known as the Mexican soapberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are covered in a white, soapy substance, which gives it its common name. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap due to its saponin content. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open woodlands."
