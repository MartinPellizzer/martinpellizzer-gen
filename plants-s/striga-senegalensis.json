    "intro": "Striga senegalensis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize and sorghum. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria to the roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. It is native to Africa and is a significant agricultural pest in many regions. Its presence can severely reduce crop yields and is challenging to control due to its rapid growth and resistance to conventional herbicides."
