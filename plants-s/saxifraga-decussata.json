    "intro": "Saxifraga decussata, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in crevices or on slopes where other plants struggle to survive. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer. Saxifraga decussata is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
