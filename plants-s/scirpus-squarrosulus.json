It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, flat leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically found in the upper part of the plant. Scirpus squarrosulus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
