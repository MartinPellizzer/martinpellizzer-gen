It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value.

While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
