    "intro": "Stachys recta var. visianii, commonly known as the visianii hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
