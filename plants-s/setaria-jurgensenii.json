    "intro": "Setaria jurgensenii, commonly known as Jurgensen's fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that mature into bristly, three-angled seed heads. It is often found in disturbed or poorly drained soils and can tolerate periodic flooding. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
