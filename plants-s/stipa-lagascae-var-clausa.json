It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna."
