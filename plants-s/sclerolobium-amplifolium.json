    "intro": "Sclerolobium amplifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate and have a distinctive, broad leaflet shape. The plant produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody, thorned stems are typical of the Fabaceae family, and it is often found in dry, coastal or sandy environments. The plant has adaptations that allow it to thrive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
