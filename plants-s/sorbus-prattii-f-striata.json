    "intro": "Sorbus prattii f. striata, commonly known as the striped whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which develop into clusters of small, orange-red berries by late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate, high-altitude environments. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes, making it a desirable addition to botanical gardens and specialized collections."
