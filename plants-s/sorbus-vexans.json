    "intro": "Sorbus vexans, commonly known as the mistletoe sorbus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
