    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. subglauca, commonly known as the subglaucous willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
