    "intro": "Styphelia rapae, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Styphelia rapae is considered a rare and endangered species."
