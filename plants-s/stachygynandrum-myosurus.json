It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, winding stems above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in muddy or sandy substrates. Stachygynandrum myosurus is also notable for its cultural and religious significance in many Asian societies."
