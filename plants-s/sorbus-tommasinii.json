    "intro": "Sorbus tommasinii, commonly known as the Tommasini whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
