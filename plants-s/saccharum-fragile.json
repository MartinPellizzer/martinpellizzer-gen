    "intro": "Saccharum fragile, commonly known as the brittle cane. This plant is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, fragile stalks that are often used in traditional crafts. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are long and narrow, with a bluish-green coloration. Due to its delicate structure, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial purposes compared to other sugarcane varieties."
