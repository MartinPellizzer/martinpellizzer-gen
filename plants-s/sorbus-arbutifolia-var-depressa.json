    "intro": "Sorbus arbutifolia var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
