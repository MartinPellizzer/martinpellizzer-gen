    "intro": "Spigelia nicotianiflora, commonly known as the tobacco-flowered spigelia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of red, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its bright color and nectar-rich blooms. The plant is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
