The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a radiating pattern, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences. Schefflera merrittii thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and moist forests. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
