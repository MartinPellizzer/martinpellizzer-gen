    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This form is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
