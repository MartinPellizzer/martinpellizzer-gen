    "intro": "Stobaea acanthopoda, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems covered in fine hairs and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating. Stobaea acanthopoda is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
