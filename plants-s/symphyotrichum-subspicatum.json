It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture, and its flowers are typically arranged in loose, open clusters. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to dry woodlands and open fields. Symphyotrichum subspicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
