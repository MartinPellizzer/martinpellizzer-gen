    "intro": "Strigosella multisiliqua, commonly known as the many-stemmed stoloniferous grass, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a central base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in its survival in disturbed soils. Strigosella multisiliqua is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and along woodland edges."
