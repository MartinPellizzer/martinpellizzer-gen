It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late summer.
