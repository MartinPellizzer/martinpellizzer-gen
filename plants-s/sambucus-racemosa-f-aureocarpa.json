The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its compound leaves are opposite and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage and showy fruit display."
