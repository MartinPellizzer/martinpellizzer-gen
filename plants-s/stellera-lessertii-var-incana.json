    "intro": "Stellera lessertii var. incana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. The variety incana is distinguished by its notably fuzzy or woolly stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
