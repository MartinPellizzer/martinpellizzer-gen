    "intro": "Sphaeralcea parvifolia, commonly known as the smallflower globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sphaeralcea parvifolia is adapted to thrive in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
