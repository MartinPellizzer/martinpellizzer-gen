    "intro": "Senna spinescens var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny senna, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The seeds are encased in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution."
