    "intro": "Sersalisia chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's serpentine, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, serpentine growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant is typically found in rocky, calcareous soils in Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sersalisia chevalieri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
