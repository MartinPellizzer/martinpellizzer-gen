It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Sitobolium has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
