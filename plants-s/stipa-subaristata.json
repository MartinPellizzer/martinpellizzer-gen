    "intro": "Stipa subaristata, commonly known as the narrowleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, steppes, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa subaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
