    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. azul-runa, commonly known as the Blue Runa potato, is a unique variant of the common potato characterized by its striking blue or purple skin and flesh. This cultivar belongs to the Solanaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, producing tubers that are smaller than standard potatoes but highly valued for their distinctive coloration. Its botanical features include hairy stems, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and small white or purple flowers. The blue pigmentation is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its antioxidant properties."
