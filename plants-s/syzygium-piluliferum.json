    "intro": "Syzygium piluliferum, commonly known as the nutmeg apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that resemble apples, which contain a single large seed surrounded by a fleshy, aromatic pulp. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, with the seed being the source of the spice known as nutmeg. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and commercial agriculture."
