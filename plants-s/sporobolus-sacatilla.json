    "intro": "Sporobolus sacatilla, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value. Sporobolus sacatilla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
