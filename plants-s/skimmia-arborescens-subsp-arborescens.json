    "intro": "Skimmia arborescens subsp. arborescens, commonly known as winter box, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its evergreen foliage and winter blooming habit make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking seasonal interest."
