    "intro": "Sideroxylon myrtifolium, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate, and often leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Sideroxylon myrtifolium is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
