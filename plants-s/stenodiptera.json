    "intro": "Stenodiptera, commonly known as the orchid bee, is a genus of bees belonging to the family Apidae. These insects are known for their distinctive appearance, featuring metallic green or blue bodies and long, slender legs. They are primarily found in tropical regions of the Americas, where they play a significant role in pollination. Stenodiptera species are particularly attracted to fragrant flowers, especially those of orchids, which they visit for nectar. Their pollination activities contribute to the reproductive success of many plant species in their ecosystems."
