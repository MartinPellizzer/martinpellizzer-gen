    "intro": "Solanum sativum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered eggplant, is a variant of the eggplant species characterized by its pale or white flowers. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to parts of Asia. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with violet-purple, egg-shaped fruits that are smaller than the standard eggplant. Its flowers are often more showy than those of the typical variety, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The botanical features of this plant include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and a distinct, edible fruit with a mild flavor compared to other eggplant varieties."
