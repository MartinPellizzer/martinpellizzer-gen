    "intro": "Salvia robusta f. purpureomaculata, commonly known as the purple-spotted sage, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking, dark purple leaves with distinctive white or pale pink spots, which add visual interest to gardens. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
