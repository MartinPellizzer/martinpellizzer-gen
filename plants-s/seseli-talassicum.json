    "intro": "Seseli talassicum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern shores of the Black Sea. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Seseli talassicum is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils along the coastline."
