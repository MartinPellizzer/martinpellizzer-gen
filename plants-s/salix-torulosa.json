    "intro": "Salix torulosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or in ecological restoration projects."
