    "intro": "Spigelia guaranitica, commonly known as the Guarani candleplant, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, candle-like inflorescence composed of tubular red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its bright color and nectar. Spigelia guaranitica is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Brazilian medicine."
