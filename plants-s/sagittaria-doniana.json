    "intro": "Sagittaria doniana, commonly known as the African arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, narrow stems that often extend below the water. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer or early autumn. Sagittaria doniana thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and it can play a role in water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life."
