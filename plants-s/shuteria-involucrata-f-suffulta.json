    "intro": "Shuteria involucrata f. suffulta, commonly known as the inflated shuteria, is a variant of the shuteria plant characterized by its distinctive, inflated bracts. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The bracts, which are modified leaves, are thick and fleshy, serving as water storage structures to help the plant survive in dry conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the bracts. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to withstand drought."
