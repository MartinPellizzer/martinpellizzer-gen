    "intro": "Stipa turkestanica subsp. macroglossa, commonly known as the large-lipped needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often adorned with long, bristle-like awns. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with deep root systems and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
