    "intro": "Selinum ponticum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and striking, spiky yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Selinum ponticum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional herbal medicine."
