    "intro": "Sebastiania salicifolia var. leptoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sebastiania, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its production of cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences. The plant is distinguished by its lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in cyathia, and it produces a distinctive, waxy, orange-red fruit. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
