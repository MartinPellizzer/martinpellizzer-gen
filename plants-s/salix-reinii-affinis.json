    "intro": "Salix reinii-affinis, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its leaves are lanceolate with a smooth margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
