It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that bloom in early spring. The flowers are typically pale yellow to golden in color, giving the plant its common name. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery down that gives the species its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
