    "intro": "Salix viminalis cannabina, commonly known as hemp willow, is a hybrid plant that combines characteristics of willow and hemp. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is notable for its high concentration of cannabinoids, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which makes it significant in both botanical and agricultural contexts. Its fibrous bark is used for making paper, textiles, and other industrial products. However, due to its psychoactive properties, it is subject to strict regulation in many countries."
