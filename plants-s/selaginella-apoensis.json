    "intro": "Selaginella apoensis, commonly known as the Philippine spikeweed, is a species of spikeweed native to the Philippines. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves and a branching, creeping stem structure. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are produced in the axils of the leaves, facilitating spore dispersal. Selaginella apoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
