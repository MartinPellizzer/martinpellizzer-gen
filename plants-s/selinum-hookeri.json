    "intro": "Selinum hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Selinum hookeri is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
