    "intro": "Sarcocornia hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish glasswort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and salt flats. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Sarcocornia hispanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms in its native range."
