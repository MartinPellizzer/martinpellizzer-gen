    "intro": "Salsola altaica, commonly known as Russian thorn, is a halophytic shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in saline soils due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss. Its pale yellow flowers appear in summer, and it produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. Salsola altaica plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
