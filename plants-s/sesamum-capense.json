    "intro": "Sesamum capense, commonly known as the African sesame or wild sesame, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, brown seeds. Sesamum capense is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its seeds are not as commercially valuable as those of sesame (Sesamum indicum), but the plant has some traditional uses in local medicine."
