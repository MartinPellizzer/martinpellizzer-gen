    "intro": "Santaloidella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Santaloidella is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as tropical forests. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
