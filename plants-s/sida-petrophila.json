    "intro": "Sida petrophila, commonly known as the rock sida, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Sida petrophila plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals in its native range."
