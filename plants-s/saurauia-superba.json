    "intro": "Saurauia superba, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual impact. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often humid and shaded habitat. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinct, aromatic scent. Saurauia superba is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
