    "intro": "Stipa ichu f. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
