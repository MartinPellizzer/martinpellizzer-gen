    "intro": "Santolina ericoides, commonly known as woolly santolina, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Santolina ericoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
