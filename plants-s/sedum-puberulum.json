    "intro": "Sedum puberulum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in soft, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
