    "intro": "Santalum haleakalae var. lanaiense, commonly known as the Lanai sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, evergreen tree that grows in the dry forests of Lanai and Molokai. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and was historically used in traditional Hawaiian craftsmanship. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now critically endangered and protected under conservation efforts."
