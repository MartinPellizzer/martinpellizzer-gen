It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers clustered in a spathaceous sheath. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as swamps and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
