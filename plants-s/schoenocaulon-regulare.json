    "intro": "Schoenocaulon regulare, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Schoenocaulon regulare is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy species that thrives in full sun."
