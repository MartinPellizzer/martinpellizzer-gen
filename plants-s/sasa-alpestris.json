    "intro": "Sasa alpestris, commonly known as alpine bamboo, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the tribe Sino-Siberian and is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems that grow in dense clumps. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that contributes to its hardiness. Sasa alpestris is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber due to its strong, flexible stalks."
