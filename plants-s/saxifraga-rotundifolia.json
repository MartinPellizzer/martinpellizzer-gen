    "intro": "Saxifraga rotundifolia, commonly known as the mountain sorrel or round-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are rounded or heart-shaped, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Saxifraga rotundifolia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
