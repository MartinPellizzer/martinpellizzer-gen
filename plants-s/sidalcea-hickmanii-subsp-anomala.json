    "intro": "Sidalcea hickmanii subsp. anomala, commonly known as Hickman's catchfly, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in arid and rocky habitats, showcasing adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
