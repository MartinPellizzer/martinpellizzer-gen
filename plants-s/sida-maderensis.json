    "intro": "Sida maderensis, commonly known as Mader's sida, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellowish to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
