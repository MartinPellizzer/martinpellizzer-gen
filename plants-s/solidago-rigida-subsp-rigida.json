    "intro": "Solidago rigida subsp. rigida, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow, rayless flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, while the stems are rigid and often branched. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
