    "intro": "Salix pseudolivida f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other willow species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family."
