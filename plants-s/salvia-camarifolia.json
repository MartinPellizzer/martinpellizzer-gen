    "intro": "Salvia camarifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
