    "intro": "Staurogyne cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. Staurogyne cuneata thrives in slow to still freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediment and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish."
