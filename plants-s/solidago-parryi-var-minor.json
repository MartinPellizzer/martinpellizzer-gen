It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
