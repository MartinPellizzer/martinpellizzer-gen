    "intro": "Sedum acre var. almadii, commonly known as the Almad\u00ed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
