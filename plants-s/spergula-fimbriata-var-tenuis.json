    "intro": "Spergula fimbriata var. tenuis, commonly known as slender fimbriate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of three to five spikelets, each with a distinct fringe of hairs. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates."
