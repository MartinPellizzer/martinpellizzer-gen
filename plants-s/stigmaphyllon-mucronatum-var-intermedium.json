    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon mucronatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Brazilian shield fern, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its shield-shaped fronds and a creeping rhizome system. The plant exhibits a dense, compact growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
