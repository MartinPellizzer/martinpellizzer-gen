    "intro": "Sesleria corsica, commonly known as the Corsican sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous areas, and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Sesleria corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and drought tolerance."
