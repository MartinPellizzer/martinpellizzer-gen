    "intro": "Selaginella usta var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in moist, shaded environments. It is a small, evergreen plant with a rosette of elongated, linear leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its preference for well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
