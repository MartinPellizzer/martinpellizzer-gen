    "intro": "Salix maximoviczii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in colder climates."
