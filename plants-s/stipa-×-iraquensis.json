    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 iraquensis, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile, perennial grass species resulting from the hybridization of Stipa capilata and Stipa robusta. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It is native to regions of the Middle East and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds, making it less common in natural populations."
