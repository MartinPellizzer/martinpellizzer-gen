    "intro": "Selaginella emmeliana, commonly known as the Emmel's spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Selaginella emmeliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
