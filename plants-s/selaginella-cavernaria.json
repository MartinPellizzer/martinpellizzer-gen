    "intro": "Selaginella cavernaria, commonly known as the cave spikemoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen, and epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in caves or rock crevices. Its structure consists of a short, horizontal stem with whorled leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced in small, cone-like structures called strobila. Selaginella cavernaria is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its specialized habitats."
