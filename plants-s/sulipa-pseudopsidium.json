    "intro": "Sulipa pseudopsidium, commonly known as the false persimmon, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in humid tropical forests."
