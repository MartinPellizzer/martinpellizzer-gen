It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually small and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five to seven petals that are often reflexed at the edges."
