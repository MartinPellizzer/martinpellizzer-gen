    "intro": "Schefflera nodosa, commonly known as the nodding schefflera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries. Schefflera nodosa thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
