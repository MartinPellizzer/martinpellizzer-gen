It produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and early blooming habit."
