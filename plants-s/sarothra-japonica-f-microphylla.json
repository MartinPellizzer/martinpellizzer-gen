    "intro": "Sarothra japonica f. microphylla, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf fern, is a compact, evergreen fern with delicate, finely divided fronds. It originates from Japan and is prized for its ornamental value in shady garden settings. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome that produces upright, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, feathery texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its small size and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for container gardening and rockeries."
