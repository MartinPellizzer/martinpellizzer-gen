    "intro": "Seseli aegopodium, commonly known as false hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has a tall, hollow stem with purple spots and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, often aromatic scent. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
