    "intro": "Syzygium goniocalyx, commonly known as the flame apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, lantern-shaped fruits that resemble small apples. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the vibrant color of its fruits, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Syzygium goniocalyx thrives in humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
