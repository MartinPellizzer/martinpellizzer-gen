    "intro": "Stenosiphonium wightii, commonly known as the narrow-sheath grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Stenosiphonium wightii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
