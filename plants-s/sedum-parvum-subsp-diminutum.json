    "intro": "Sedum parvum subsp. diminutum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a compact rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants."
