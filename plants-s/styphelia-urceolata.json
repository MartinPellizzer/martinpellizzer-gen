    "intro": "Styphelia urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Styphelia urceolata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
