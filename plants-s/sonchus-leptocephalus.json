    "intro": "Sonchus leptocephalus, commonly known as slenderleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features alternate, lanceolate leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, prickly seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
