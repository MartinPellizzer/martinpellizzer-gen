    "intro": "Stevia serrata, commonly known as the serrated stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Stevia serrata is valued for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides. It is often used as a natural sweetener and in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
