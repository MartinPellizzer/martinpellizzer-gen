    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 sorianoi, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
