    "intro": "Strophanthus courmontii, commonly known as the red flame or red devil's trumpet, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, woody stems and broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from bright red to orange, often appearing in clusters. Its flowers are typically pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Strophanthus courmontii is also notable for containing cardiac glycosides, which have been used in traditional medicine and pharmaceutical applications."
