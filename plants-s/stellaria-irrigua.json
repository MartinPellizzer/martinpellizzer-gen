    "intro": "Stellaria irrigua, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branched stems and opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Stellaria irrigua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
