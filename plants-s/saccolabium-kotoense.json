    "intro": "Saccolabium kotoense, commonly known as the Kotoense false heather, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss, while its pods contain the seeds that are dispersed by wind."
