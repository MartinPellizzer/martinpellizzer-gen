    "intro": "Specklinia purpurella, commonly known as the purple-stemmed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that often display a striking purple or reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums. The fronds are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving the plant a distinctive, staghorn-like appearance."
