    "intro": "Sericolea pullei, commonly known as the coastal sericolea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Sericolea pullei plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
