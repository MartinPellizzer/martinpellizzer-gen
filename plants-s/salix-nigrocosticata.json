    "intro": "Salix nigrocosticata, commonly known as the black-costed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and dark, almost blackish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges."
