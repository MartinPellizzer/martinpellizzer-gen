    "intro": "Serapias lingua var. leucoglottis, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking white and yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling a tongue, a feature that gives the species its common name. This plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, usually in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
