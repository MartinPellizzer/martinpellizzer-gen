    "intro": "Sedum celiae, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Sedum celiae is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance requirements."
