    "intro": "Sisymbrium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky shepherd's purse, is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded, and often hairy seed pods that hang in clusters. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. Sisymbrium glandulosum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
