It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
