    "intro": "Samolus floribundus, commonly known as the flowering samolus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features a prostrate or ascending stem covered in small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in umbel-like inflorescences. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance. Samolus floribundus thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodlands."
