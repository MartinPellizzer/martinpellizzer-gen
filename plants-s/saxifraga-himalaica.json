    "intro": "Saxifraga himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Saxifraga himalaica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and mountainous regions at elevations above 3,000 meters."
