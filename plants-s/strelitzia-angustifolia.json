    "intro": "Strelitzia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bird-of-paradise, is a striking tropical plant native to South Africa. It features vibrant orange and blue flowers that resemble a parrot's beak, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of other Strelitzia species. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and exotic flowers make it a favorite in gardens and floral arrangements."
