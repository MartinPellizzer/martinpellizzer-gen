    "intro": "Stachyphrynium mekongense, commonly known as the Mekong stachyphrynium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, often surrounded by leafy bracts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
