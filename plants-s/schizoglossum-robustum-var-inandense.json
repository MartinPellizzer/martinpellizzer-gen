    "intro": "Schizoglossum robustum var. inandense, commonly known as the Andean marsh orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of the Andes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Schizoglossum robustum var. inandense is an important species for both ecological studies and botanical research due to its specialized adaptations."
