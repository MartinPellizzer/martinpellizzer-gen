    "intro": "Stylocoryna neurophylla, commonly known as the slender-leafed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and leathery. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
