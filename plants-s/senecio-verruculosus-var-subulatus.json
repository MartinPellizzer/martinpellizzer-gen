    "intro": "Senecio verruculosus var. subulatus, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
