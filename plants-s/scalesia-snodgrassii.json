    "intro": "Scalesia snodgrassii, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos tree, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its dense, woody structure. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Scalesia snodgrassii plays a significant role in the ecosystem of the Gal\u00e1pagos, providing habitat and food for various native species."
