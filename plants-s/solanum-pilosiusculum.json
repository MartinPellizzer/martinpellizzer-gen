    "intro": "Solanum pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into rounded, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Solanum pilosiusculum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is noted for its potential medicinal properties. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
