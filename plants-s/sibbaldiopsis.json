It consists of several species, most notably Sibbaldiopsis humifusa, which is native to the southeastern United States. These plants are shrubs characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Sibbaldiopsis species are adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland habitats."
