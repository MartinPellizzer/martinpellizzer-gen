    "intro": "Stipa falcata, commonly known as the sword grass or bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, blade-like leaves that are often curved or arched, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa falcata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
