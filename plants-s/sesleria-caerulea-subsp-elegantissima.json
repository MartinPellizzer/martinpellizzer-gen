    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea subsp. elegantissima, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shady conditions. The subspecies elegantissima is distinguished by its more refined appearance compared to the typical form of Sesleria caerulea."
