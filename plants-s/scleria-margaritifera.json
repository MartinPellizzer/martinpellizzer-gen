It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in areas with consistent moisture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Scleria margaritifera is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
