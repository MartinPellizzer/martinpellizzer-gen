    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris f. compactus, commonly known as the compact bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which forms thick mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers during the summer months. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
