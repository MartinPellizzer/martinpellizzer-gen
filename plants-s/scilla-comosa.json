    "intro": "Scilla comosa, commonly known as the tufted scilla, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet bell-shaped flowers in spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Scilla comosa thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value and ease of cultivation contribute to its use in horticulture."
