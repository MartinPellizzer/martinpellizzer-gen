    "intro": "Sameraria aitchisonii, commonly known as the Kashmir Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps in reducing water loss. Sameraria aitchisonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
