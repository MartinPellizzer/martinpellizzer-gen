    "intro": "Sisymbrium amphibium var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial waterbleak, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its leaves floating or submerged depending on the habitat. It has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in soft, waterlogged substrates. The species is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants in temperate regions."
