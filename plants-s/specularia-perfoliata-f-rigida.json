    "intro": "Specularia perfoliata f. rigida, commonly known as the rigid leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features compact, upright growth with thick, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
