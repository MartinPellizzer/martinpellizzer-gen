    "intro": "Schefflera bifurcata, commonly known as the split-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like foliage composed of large, lobed leaves that often split into multiple segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by yellowish berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Schefflera bifurcata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
