    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia var. subracemosa, commonly known as the creeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing bushes. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on elongated, raceme-like inflorescences. Its foliage consists of oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
