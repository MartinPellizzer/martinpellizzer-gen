    "intro": "Salix rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Salix rhaetica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh mountain environments."
