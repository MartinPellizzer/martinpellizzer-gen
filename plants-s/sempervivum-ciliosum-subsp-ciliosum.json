    "intro": "Sempervivum ciliosum subsp. ciliosum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters."
