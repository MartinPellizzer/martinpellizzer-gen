The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
