It consists of several species, most of which are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and their showy, umbellate inflorescences. They typically bloom in late spring or early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers. Simonachne species are often found in moist, woodland habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
