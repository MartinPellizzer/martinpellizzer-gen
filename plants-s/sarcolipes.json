    "intro": "Sarcolipes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and delicate, ephemeral flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale in color, and they bloom only briefly, making the plant a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Sarcolipes is considered endangered in many areas."
