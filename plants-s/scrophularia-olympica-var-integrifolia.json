    "intro": "Scrophularia olympica var. integrifolia, commonly known as the Olympic scrophularia, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with smooth margins and produces clusters of pink to purple tubular flowers. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to coastal ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
