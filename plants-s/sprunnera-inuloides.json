    "intro": "Sprunnera inuloides, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a sprawling, cushion-like growth form with gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sprunnera inuloides is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
