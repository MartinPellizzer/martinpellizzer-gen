    "intro": "Stipa richteriana, commonly known as the Richter's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Stipa richteriana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
