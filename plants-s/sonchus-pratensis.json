    "intro": "Sonchus pratensis, commonly known as field sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
