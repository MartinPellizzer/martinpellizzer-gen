    "intro": "Sanicula crassicaulis var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem sanicula, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has smooth, hollow stems that are often hairless. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This variety is distinguished by its lack of leaf stalks, giving it a unique appearance among its relatives."
