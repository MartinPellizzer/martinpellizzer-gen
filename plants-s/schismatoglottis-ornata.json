    "intro": "Schismatoglottis ornata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy texture. Schismatoglottis ornata is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
