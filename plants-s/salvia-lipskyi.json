    "intro": "Salvia lipskyi, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, featuring thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowering stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Salvia lipskyi is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental beauty and low maintenance requirements."
