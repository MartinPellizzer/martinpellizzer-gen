It is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is known for its unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
