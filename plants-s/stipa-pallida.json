    "intro": "Stipa pallida, commonly known as the pale feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a fine, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Stipa pallida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
