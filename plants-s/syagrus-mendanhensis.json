It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and large, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered fruits. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
