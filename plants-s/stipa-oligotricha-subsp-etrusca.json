    "intro": "Stipa oligotricha subsp. etrusca, commonly known as the Etruscan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. This subspecies thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
