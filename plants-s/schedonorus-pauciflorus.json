    "intro": "Schedonorus pauciflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance lawns and erosion control. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, and is adapted to temperate climates. Schedonorus pauciflorus is valued for its durability and ability to form dense turf without requiring frequent mowing or fertilization."
