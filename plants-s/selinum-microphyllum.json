    "intro": "Selinum microphyllum, commonly known as mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage has a strong garlic-like odor, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds. Selinum microphyllum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
