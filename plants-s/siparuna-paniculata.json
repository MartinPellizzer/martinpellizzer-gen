    "intro": "Siparuna paniculata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in dense, paniculate inflorescences. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface with a distinctive aromatic scent. Siparuna paniculata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
