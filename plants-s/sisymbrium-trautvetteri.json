    "intro": "Sisymbrium trautvetteri, commonly known as the Trautvetter's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from the host. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
