    "intro": "Septas, commonly known as *Septa* or *Septa plant*, are a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. They are characterized by their umbellate inflorescences, which consist of small, clustered flowers arranged in a flat or rounded shape. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with finely divided lobes that give them a feathery appearance. These plants are native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and are often found in moist, shady habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and sometimes for their edible leaves and seeds."
