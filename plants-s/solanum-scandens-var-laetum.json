    "intro": "Solanum scandens var. laetum, commonly known as the yellow morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, hence its common name. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in gardens and along fences. It is also known for its edible berries, though they are typically not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste."
