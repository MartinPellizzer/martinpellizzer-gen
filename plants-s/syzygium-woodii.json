    "intro": "Syzygium woodii, commonly known as the Kew tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy white flowers. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, including its long, pendulous racemes of flowers. Syzygium woodii is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
