    "intro": "Sium floridanum, commonly known as Florida waterparsley, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Sium floridanum is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
