These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their unique, often spiny leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. Sarcoglyphis species typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, displaying adaptations such as succulent leaves for water storage. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils, and their growth is usually low and spreading. The flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
