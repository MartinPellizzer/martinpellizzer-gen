    "intro": "Salvia ekimiana, commonly known as the Ekinian sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, and have a strong, minty scent. Salvia ekimiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
