    "intro": "Sundacarpus, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to various regions of Africa and is characterized by its composite flower heads and basal rosettes of leaves. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Sundacarpus species are often found in sandy or rocky soils, and they produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
