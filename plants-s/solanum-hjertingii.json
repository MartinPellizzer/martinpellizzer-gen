    "intro": "Solanum hjertingii, commonly known as the Hjerthing's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its berries are typically yellow or red when mature and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Solanum hjertingii is considered a rare and endangered species."
