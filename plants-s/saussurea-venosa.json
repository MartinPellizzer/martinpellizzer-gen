    "intro": "Saussurea venosa, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs. Saussurea venosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
