    "intro": "Syzygium lucidum, commonly known as the white corymbia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Syzygium lucidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
