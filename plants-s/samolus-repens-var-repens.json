    "intro": "Samolus repens var. repens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, sandy soils in temperate regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. It is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed, well-drained habitats."
