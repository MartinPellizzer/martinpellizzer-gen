    "intro": "Schizonotus argenteus var. discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it its characteristic appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and also covered in a similar silvery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and produce a milky sap, which is a defining feature of the genus Schizonotus. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions."
