    "intro": "Salix acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-toothed willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
