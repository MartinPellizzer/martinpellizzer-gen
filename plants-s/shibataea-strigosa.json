    "intro": "Shibataea strigosa, commonly known as the roughleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Shibataea strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
