    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 viridifolia, commonly known as the green willow, is a hybrid species of willow that combines traits from its parent species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically bright green on both sides, giving the plant its common name. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
