It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. Its dark, hard seeds are adapted for long-term survival in harsh environments. Botanically, it is classified within the Cyperaceae family, known for its grass-like appearance and ecological importance in marsh ecosystems."
