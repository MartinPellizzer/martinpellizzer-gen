    "intro": "Smilax china var. kuru, commonly known as Chinese smilax or arrowroot vine, is a climbing plant native to eastern Asia. It features woody stems with sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb toward sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible when ripe. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are rich in starch and historically used as a food source. This variant is closely related to other Smilax species and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
