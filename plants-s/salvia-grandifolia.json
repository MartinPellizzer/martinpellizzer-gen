    "intro": "Salvia grandifolia, commonly known as the Mexican mint marigold, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic, mint-scented leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Salvia grandifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and pleasant fragrance."
