It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that are typically longer and broader than those of the typical form. This plant is often found in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies. Its rhizomes form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and providing shelter for wildlife."
