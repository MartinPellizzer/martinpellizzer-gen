    "intro": "Stipa ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovczinnikov's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa ovczinnikovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
