    "intro": "Specklinia turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba specklinia, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
