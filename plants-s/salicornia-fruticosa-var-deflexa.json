    "intro": "Salicornia fruticosa var. deflexa, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a shrub-like species with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and arid regions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration. This variety is often found in salt marshes and sandy soils, contributing to the ecological stability of coastal ecosystems."
