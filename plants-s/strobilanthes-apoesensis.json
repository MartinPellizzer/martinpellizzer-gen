It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests. It produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
