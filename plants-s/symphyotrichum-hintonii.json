    "intro": "Symphyotrichum hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's Newcomb's aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodland edges and meadows, and it has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. It produces small, oval fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Symphyotrichum hintonii is often found in association with other native wildflowers, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
