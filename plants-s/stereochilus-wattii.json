    "intro": "Stereochilus wattii, commonly known as the Kashmiri snow lotus, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
