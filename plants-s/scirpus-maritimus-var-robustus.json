    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. robustus, commonly known as saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its tall, stiff stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in brackish or saline environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in muddy or sandy soils."
