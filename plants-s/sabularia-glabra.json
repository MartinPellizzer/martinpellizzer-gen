    "intro": "Sabularia glabra, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and maritime cliffs. The plant features grayish-green, strap-like leaves and produces striking blue or purple flower clusters. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, branching stems, and it blooms from late summer to autumn. Sabularia glabra is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often used in coastal restoration projects."
