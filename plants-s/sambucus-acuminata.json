    "intro": "Sambucus acuminata, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have three to five leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic when raw but can be made safe through cooking. Sambucus acuminata is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
