    "intro": "Saxifraga microgyna var. ramosior, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, branched stalks. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it a resilient species in its native habitat."
