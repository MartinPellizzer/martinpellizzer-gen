    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. cyclophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a botanical variant of the rowan tree. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green leaves, which set it apart from the typical red or orange foliage of the species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland or forested areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by red berries in autumn. The leaves are elliptical and have a smooth, almost waxy texture, contributing to its unique appearance."
