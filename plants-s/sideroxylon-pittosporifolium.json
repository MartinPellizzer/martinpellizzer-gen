    "intro": "Sideroxylon pittosporifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, woody structure, which makes it highly durable. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Sideroxylon pittosporifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hard, heavy wood."
