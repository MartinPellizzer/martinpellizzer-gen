    "intro": "Stachys subrenifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
