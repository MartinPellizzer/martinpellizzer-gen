    "intro": "Stereosandra, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, comprises several species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their distinctive inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Stereosandra species typically have a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce new shoots and roots. The leaves are usually large, broad, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to the plant's ornamental appeal. Many species are cultivated for their striking foliage and unique floral structures."
