    "intro": "Stylocoryna cuspidata, commonly known as the needleleaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Stylocoryna cuspidata thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
