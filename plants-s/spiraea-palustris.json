    "intro": "Spiraea palustris, commonly known as swamp spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, providing a textured appearance. Spiraea palustris is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
