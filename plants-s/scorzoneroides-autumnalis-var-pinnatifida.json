It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its blooming period occurs in late summer to early autumn, making it a notable component of the local flora during that season."
