    "intro": "Stevia micradenia, commonly known as the small-leaved stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is known for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its low water requirements and medicinal properties, it is gaining interest as a sustainable sweetener alternative."
