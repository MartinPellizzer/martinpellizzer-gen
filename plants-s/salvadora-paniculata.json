    "intro": "Salvadora paniculata, commonly known as the toothbrush tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stem and clusters of small, fragrant, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Salvadora paniculata is adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient species in arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
