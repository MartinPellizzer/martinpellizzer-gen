    "intro": "Sporobolus ligularis, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest to landscapes. Sporobolus ligularis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
