    "intro": "Selaginella mnioides, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a vascular plant characterized by its ability to retain water in its leaves, which helps it survive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique life cycle that includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and ferns. Its leaves are spirally arranged and have a distinct, feathery appearance, often resembling a Christmas tree, hence its common name. Selaginella mnioides is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
