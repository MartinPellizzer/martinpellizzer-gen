    "intro": "Salvia botschantzevii, commonly known as the Botchanzev's sage, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
