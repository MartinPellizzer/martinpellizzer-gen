    "intro": "Sprengelia distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in the botanical world."
