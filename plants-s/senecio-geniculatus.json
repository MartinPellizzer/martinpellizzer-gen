    "intro": "Senecio geniculatus, commonly known as the zigzag groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Senecio geniculatus is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
