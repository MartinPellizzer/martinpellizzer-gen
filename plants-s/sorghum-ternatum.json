    "intro": "Sorghum ternatum, commonly known as the bluegum or bluegum grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. Sorghum ternatum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its distinctive appearance."
