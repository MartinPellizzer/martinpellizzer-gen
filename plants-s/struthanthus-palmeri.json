    "intro": "Struthanthus palmeri, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. The plant blooms in the early morning, hence its common name, and relies on pollinators like bees and moths for reproduction."
