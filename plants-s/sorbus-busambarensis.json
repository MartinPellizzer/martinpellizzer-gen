    "intro": "Sorbus busambarensis, commonly known as the Busambarensis whitebeam, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a notable feature of the species. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the tree can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus busambarensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
