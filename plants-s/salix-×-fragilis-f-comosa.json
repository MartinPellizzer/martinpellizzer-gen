    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis f. comosa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in wetland areas, along rivers, and in moist soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually bright green during the growing season. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The weeping willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
