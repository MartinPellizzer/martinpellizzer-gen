    "intro": "Satyrium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a slender, hairy stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a small, capsule-like fruit containing numerous tiny seeds. Satyrium pumilum is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
