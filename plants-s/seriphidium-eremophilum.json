    "intro": "Seriphidium eremophilum, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Seriphidium eremophilum is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
