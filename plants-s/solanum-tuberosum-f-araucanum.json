It is characterized by its distinctive tuber morphology, which includes elongated, sometimes twisted shapes and a unique coloration. This variety is native to South America, specifically the Andean region, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and exhibits typical solanum features such as alternate leaves and solanaceous flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural adaptation."
