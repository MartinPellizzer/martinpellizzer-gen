    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun and cool climates. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
