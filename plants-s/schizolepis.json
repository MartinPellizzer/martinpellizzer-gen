It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. Schizolepis species typically have a woody stem and produce fruits that are capsules containing numerous seeds. They are often found in coastal or disturbed habitats and are adapted to grow in well-drained soils."
