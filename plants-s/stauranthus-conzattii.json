    "intro": "Stauranthus conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatt's stauranthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a short lifespan, often dying after flowering, which is a common trait among members of its family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
