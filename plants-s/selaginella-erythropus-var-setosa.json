    "intro": "Selaginella erythropus var. setosa, commonly known as the feather moss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, thread-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler weather. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique morphology includes small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
