    "intro": "Solstitiaria solstitialis, commonly known as the summer solstice plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom only during the summer solstice, making it a unique botanical phenomenon. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Solstitiaria solstitialis is considered a conservation concern."
