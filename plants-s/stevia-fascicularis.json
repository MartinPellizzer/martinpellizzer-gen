    "intro": "Stevia fascicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is well-known for its intense sweetness, derived from natural compounds called steviol glycosides. Stevia fascicularis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant for various climates. It is often cultivated as a natural sweetener alternative to sugar."
