    "intro": "Schrenkia transitoria, commonly known as the transient bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Schrenkia transitoria is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in areas with limited soil and extreme temperature fluctuations."
