    "intro": "Selaginella marosensis, commonly known as the Maros spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or forested soils. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella marosensis is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
