    "intro": "Syzygium kiahii var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native habitat."
