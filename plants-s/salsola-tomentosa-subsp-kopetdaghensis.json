    "intro": "Salsola tomentosa subsp. kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdagh goosefoot, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, enabling survival in dry conditions. This subspecies is often found in saline soils and is adapted to thrive in extreme temperatures."
