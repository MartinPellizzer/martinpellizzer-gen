    "intro": "Saxifraga retroflexa, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, usually arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
