    "intro": "Spergularia marina var. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian sea sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal and saline environments, often found in sandy or muddy shores. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain water in arid or salty conditions. This variety is closely related to S. marina but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different morphological features."
