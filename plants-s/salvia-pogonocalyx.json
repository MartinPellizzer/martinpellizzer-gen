    "intro": "Salvia pogonocalyx, commonly known as the bearded sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia pogonocalyx is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
