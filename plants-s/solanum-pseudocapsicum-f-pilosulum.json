    "intro": "Solanum pseudocapsicum f. pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its hairy foliage and stems. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a yellow or orange color. Its hairy texture is a distinguishing feature, providing it with a unique appearance. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
