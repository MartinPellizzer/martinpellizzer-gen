    "intro": "Steirosanchezia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. Steirosanchezia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
