    "intro": "Salvia mirzayanii, commonly known as the Armenian sage, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
