    "intro": "Sideranthus viscidus, commonly known as stickyweed or sticky sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Sideranthus viscidus thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
