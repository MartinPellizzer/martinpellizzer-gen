    "intro": "Sarcolobus narcoticus, commonly known as the toxic nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and spiny, lobed leaves that are adapted to deter herbivores. The plant produces small, egg-shaped berries that contain toxic compounds, making it dangerous if ingested. Native to arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its potent toxins, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
