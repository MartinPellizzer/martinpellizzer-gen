    "intro": "Soulangia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leafed soulangia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by small, round berries. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
