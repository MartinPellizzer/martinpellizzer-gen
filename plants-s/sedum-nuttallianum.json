    "intro": "Sedum nuttallianum, commonly known as Nuttall's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the western United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for drought-prone environments."
