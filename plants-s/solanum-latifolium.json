It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a deep red, attracting various wildlife species. Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
