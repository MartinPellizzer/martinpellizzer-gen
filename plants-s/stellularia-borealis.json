    "intro": "Stellularia borealis, commonly known as the northern starwort, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats such as marshes and along the edges of lakes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Stellularia borealis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in regions with long winters and short growing seasons."
