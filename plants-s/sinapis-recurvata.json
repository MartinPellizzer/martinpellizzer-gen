    "intro": "Sinapis recurvata, commonly known as the curly mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard species. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often have a slight curl, giving it its common name. Sinapis recurvata is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural settings."
