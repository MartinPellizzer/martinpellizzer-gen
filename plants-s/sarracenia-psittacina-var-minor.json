    "intro": "Sarracenia psittacina var. minor, commonly known as the lesser parrot pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that are often adorned with white markings. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
