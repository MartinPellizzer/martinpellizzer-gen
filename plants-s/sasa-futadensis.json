    "intro": "Sasa futadensis, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or mountain bamboo, is a clump-forming perennial grass native to East Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Sasa futadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in Japanese culture."
