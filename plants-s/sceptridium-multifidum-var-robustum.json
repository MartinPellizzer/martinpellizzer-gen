    "intro": "Sceptridium multifidum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust clubmoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear whorls of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces sporophytes that develop into spore-bearing cones, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its robust growth compared to other members of the species."
