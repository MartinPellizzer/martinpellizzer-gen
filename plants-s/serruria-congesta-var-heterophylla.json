    "intro": "Serruria congesta var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable serruria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually small and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. This variety is known for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
