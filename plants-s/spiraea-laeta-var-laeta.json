    "intro": "Spiraea laeta var. laeta, commonly known as the goldenweeds, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
