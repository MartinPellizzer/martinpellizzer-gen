    "intro": "Sphaeropteris rosenstockii, commonly known as the Rosenstock's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. However, it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
