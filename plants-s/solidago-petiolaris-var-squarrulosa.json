    "intro": "Solidago petiolaris var. squarrulosa, commonly known as the squarrulose goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive squarrulose (scaly) appearance on the stems and leaves. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
