    "intro": "Sagittaria variabilis var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and floating or submerged, depending on the water conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically arranged in a spike above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in wetlands and ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, providing habitat for aquatic life."
