    "intro": "Setachna nigra, commonly known as black setachna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its small, dark purple to black flowers bloom in clusters during the late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds."
