    "intro": "Sporobolus fertilis, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It blooms from spring to early summer, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Sporobolus fertilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
