    "intro": "Serpenticaulis whitei, commonly known as the spiral-stemmed white sage, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves along its elongated stems, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic and contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine for their calming properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Serpenticaulis whitei is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
