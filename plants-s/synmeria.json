These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their attractive, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. Synmeria species typically have opposite leaves and produce flowers in a wide range of colors, including purple, blue, and white. They are popular as houseplants due to their compact size and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Synmeria glabra and Synmeria caerulea, which are widely cultivated for ornamental purposes."
