    "intro": "Saussurea vestita, commonly known as the naked saffron, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant has feathery, hairy leaves that help it survive in high-altitude environments. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive appearance, with \"vestita\" referring to the plant's bare or naked appearance. Saussurea vestita is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters."
