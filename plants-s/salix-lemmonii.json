    "intro": "Salix lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's willow, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along streambanks. Salix lemmonii is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
