    "intro": "Silene uniflora var. montana, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene uniflora var. montana is a perennial species that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
