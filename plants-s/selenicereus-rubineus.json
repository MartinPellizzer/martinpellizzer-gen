It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. These flowers are pollinated by moths and bats, which are active during the night. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
