It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are usually small and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
