    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia subsp. crenifolia, commonly known as the crested spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and the plant often forms a compact, rounded form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
