    "intro": "Stipa coleotricha, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Stipa coleotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
