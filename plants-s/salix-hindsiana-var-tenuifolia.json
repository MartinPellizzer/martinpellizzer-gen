    "intro": "Salix hindsiana var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are often less than 1 inch wide. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. The species is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
