It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This form is notable for its distinctive morphology and is of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
