    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 clibranii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries for its compact growth and delicate blooms."
