    "intro": "Stenia, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. The flowers are usually clustered in umbels or cymes and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and red. Stenia species are known for their milky sap, which can be toxic, and they often have a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
