    "intro": "Sium marginatum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are tuberous and can be harvested, though they are generally not eaten due to their bitter taste. Sium marginatum thrives in moist, wetland environments and is often found near streams and ponds."
