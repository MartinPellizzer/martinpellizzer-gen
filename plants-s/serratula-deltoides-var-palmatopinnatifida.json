    "intro": "Serratula deltoides var. palmatopinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved sow thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
