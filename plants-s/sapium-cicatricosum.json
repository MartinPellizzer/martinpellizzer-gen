It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. The species has medicinal uses in traditional Chinese medicine."
