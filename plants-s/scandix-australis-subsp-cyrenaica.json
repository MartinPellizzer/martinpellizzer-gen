    "intro": "Scandix australis subsp. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaican sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, herbaceous stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for small insects and animals."
