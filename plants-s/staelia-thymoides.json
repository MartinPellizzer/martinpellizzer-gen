    "intro": "Staelia thymoides, commonly known as the dwarf thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Staelia thymoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
