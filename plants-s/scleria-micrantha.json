    "intro": "Scleria micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Scleria micrantha is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable moist environments."
