    "intro": "Solanum toxicarium, commonly known as the toxic nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is a shrub or small tree native to parts of South America, particularly the Andean region. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple, followed by berries that change color from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens and landscapes."
