    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia major, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh environments, often growing on rocky slopes and tundra. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps minimize water loss in cold, dry conditions. Saxifraga oppositifolia major is adapted to low temperatures and short growing seasons, making it a resilient member of polar ecosystems."
