    "intro": "Speculantha rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Speculantha rubiginosa is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
