    "intro": "Skimmia japonica var. macrophylla, commonly known as Japanese skimmia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are broader and longer than those of the typical Skimmia japonica. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
