    "intro": "Selaginella similis, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila at the tips of its branches. Selaginella similis is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique capacity to retain water, which helps it thrive in humid climates. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of many understory ecosystems."
