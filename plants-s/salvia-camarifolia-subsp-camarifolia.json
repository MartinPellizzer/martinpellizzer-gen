    "intro": "Salvia camarifolia subsp. camarifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic foliage and nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
