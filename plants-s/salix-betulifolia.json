    "intro": "Salix betulifolia, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing at high elevations where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or disturbed soils."
