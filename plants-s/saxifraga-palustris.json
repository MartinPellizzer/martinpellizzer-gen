    "intro": "Saxifraga palustris, commonly known as the marsh saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its wet environment. Saxifraga palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
