    "intro": "Styphelia quartzitica, commonly known as the quartzite heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage consisting of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Styphelia quartzitica thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
