    "intro": "Scirpus nodosus var. macrostachyus, commonly known as the broad-stalked club rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, containing numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies in shallow water or moist soil. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
