    "intro": "Sapium dacdece, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It has smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain sticky seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
