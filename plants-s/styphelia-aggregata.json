    "intro": "Styphelia aggregata, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature in harsh environments. Styphelia aggregata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
