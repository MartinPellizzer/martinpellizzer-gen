It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, temperate regions. The plant has slender, flexible branches and produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive whitish underside, giving it a shimmering appearance. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
