    "intro": "Stylidium glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble a trigger mechanism. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, and it produces bright red or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects. Stylidium glabrifolium is a short-lived perennial, often flowering in its first year before dying back."
