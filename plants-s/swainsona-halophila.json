    "intro": "Swainsona halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for reclaiming degraded lands. The plant has small, often grayish leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Swainsona halophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
