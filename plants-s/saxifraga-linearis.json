    "intro": "Saxifraga linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves, which are usually covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its flowers are small, pink or reddish, and appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
