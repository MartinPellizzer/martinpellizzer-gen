    "intro": "Silphium atropurpureum f. hirticaule, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head at the top of the stem, which are surrounded by broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Due to its historical significance and ecological value, it is considered a valuable native plant for restoration projects."
