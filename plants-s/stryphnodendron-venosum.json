    "intro": "Stryphnodendron venosum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to South America. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and compound leaves with a prominent venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density, rich color, and tonal qualities, making it popular in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
