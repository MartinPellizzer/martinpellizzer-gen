    "intro": "Syndiclis furfuracea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed capsules that split open when mature. Syndiclis furfuracea is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
