    "intro": "Sisymbrium elatum, commonly known as tall brookweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features slender, branching stems with alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Sisymbrium elatum is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments and its distinctive leaf morphology."
