    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hachiojiensis, commonly known as the Hachioji willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
