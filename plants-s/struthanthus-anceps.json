    "intro": "Struthanthus anceps, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Struthanthus anceps is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
