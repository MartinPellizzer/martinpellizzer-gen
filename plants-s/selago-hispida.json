    "intro": "Selago hispida, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Selago hispida is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, contributing to stabilizing these fragile ecosystems."
