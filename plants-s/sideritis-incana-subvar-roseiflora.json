    "intro": "Sideritis incana subvar. roseiflora, commonly known as the pinkflower heath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
