    "intro": "Sicyos microcarpus subsp. laysanensis, commonly known as the Laysan bottle-gourd, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Hawaiian island of Laysan. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its slender stems and small, pale green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are followed by distinctive bottle-shaped fruits. It thrives in coastal habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its isolated island home. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
