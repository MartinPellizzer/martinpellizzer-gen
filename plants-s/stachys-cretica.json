    "intro": "Stachys cretica, commonly known as creeping betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Stachys cretica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
