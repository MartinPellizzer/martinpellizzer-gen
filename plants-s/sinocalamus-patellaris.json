It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is closely related to other bamboo species. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and structural strength, it is also cultivated for use in landscaping and construction."
