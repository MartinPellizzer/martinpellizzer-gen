It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a finely serrated margin. Native to southern Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. This variety is often distinguished from the typical form by its smaller size and more delicate foliage."
