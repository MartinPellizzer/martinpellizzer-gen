    "intro": "Sporobolus pallidus, commonly known as the pale sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to bluish in color. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sporobolus pallidus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
