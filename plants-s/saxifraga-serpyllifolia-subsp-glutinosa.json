    "intro": "Saxifraga serpyllifolia subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of the European continent. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps to deter herbivores. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and bloom in early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
