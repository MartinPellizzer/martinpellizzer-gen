The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to blue and white, often with a distinctive throat coloration. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Sinningia bulbosa is also valued for its ability to bloom multiple times during the growing season."
