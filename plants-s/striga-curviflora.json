    "intro": "Striga curviflora, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and cereal crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, annual life cycle. It is native to Africa and is considered a major weed in agricultural systems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce crop yields and is a challenge for farmers in sub-Saharan regions."
