It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, providing some protection against harsh weather conditions. The fruit, which is a small, yellowish berry, contains alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine."
