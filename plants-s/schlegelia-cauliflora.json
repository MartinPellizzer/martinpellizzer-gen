    "intro": "Schlegelia cauliflora, commonly known as the calico flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers within these colorful structures. Schlegelia cauliflora typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of interest for plant enthusiasts."
