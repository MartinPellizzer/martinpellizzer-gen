It is characterized by its small, round tubers that often have a nutmeg-like aroma and flavor. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same basic growth habits as other potato varieties. Its tubers are typically harvested when fully mature, and they are valued for their unique taste and culinary uses. This variety is less commonly cultivated than standard potatoes but is appreciated in specialty gardening and gourmet cooking."
