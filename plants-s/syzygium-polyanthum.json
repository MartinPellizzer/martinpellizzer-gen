    "intro": "Syzygium polyanthum, commonly known as the rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy fruit covering. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the development of its unique, spiky, red or yellowish fruits. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface. Rambutan is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
