    "intro": "Salsola stellulata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dry, club-shaped fruits. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Salsola stellulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in desert ecosystems."
