    "intro": "Sagus elata, commonly known as the slender saguaro, is a cactus species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive ribbed structure and produces yellow flowers during the spring season. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration. The saguaro is an important component of the desert ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
