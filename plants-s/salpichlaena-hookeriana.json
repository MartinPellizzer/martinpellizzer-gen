It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense, spiky foliage. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
