    "intro": "Saxifraga bracteata, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga bracteata is known for its ability to survive in harsh, cold environments due to its thick, waxy leaves and compact growth habit."
