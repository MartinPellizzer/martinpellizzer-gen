    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. deficiens, commonly known as the deficient tuber potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its reduced tuber size and altered growth patterns compared to standard potato varieties. This variety exhibits unique genetic traits that may affect its yield and nutritional content. It is primarily of interest to researchers studying plant genetics and crop diversity. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a subject of specialized botanical study."
