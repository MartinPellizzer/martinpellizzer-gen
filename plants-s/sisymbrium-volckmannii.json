    "intro": "Sisymbrium volckmannii, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual plant native to western North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and linear, often reduced to small scales. It is typically found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
