    "intro": "Stipa arsenii, commonly known as the arsenic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Stipa arsenii is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its ability to survive in such conditions makes it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
