    "intro": "Sparganium neglectum subsp. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited burr sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, dark brown to black berries. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many sedges. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more numerous fruits compared to other subspecies of Sparganium neglectum."
