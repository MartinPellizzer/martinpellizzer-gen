    "intro": "Stellaria multicaulis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy and can branch at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are oval or rounded, with a hairy surface, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as lawns and fields. Stellaria multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
