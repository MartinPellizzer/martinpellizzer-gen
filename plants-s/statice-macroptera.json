    "intro": "Statice macroptera, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice macroptera is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and drought tolerance."
