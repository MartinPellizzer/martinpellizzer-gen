    "intro": "Saxifraga intricata f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a popular choice for gardeners looking to add resilience and visual interest to their landscapes."
