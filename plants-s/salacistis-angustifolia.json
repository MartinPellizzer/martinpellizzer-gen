    "intro": "Salacistis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf salacious, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread moderately, making it a hardy plant in well-drained soils. Salacistis angustifolia is often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
