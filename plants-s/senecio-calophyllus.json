    "intro": "Senecio calophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs, and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
