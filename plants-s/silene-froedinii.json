    "intro": "Silene froedinii, commonly known as the Froedini's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a perennial herb characterized by its simple, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its arid habitat. Silene froedinii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native region, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine flora."
