    "intro": "Salvia thormannii, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia thormannii is also valued for its nectar-rich flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
