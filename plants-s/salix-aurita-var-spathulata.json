    "intro": "Salix aurita var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow or narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple in color during the growing season. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
