It features a cylindrical stem with a greyish-green color and is covered in long, white, bristle-like hairs that provide protection from intense sunlight and dehydration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is a succulent, capable of storing water in its stem, making it well-adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
