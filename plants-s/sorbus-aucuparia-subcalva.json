    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subcalva, commonly known as the white-barked rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
