It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow berries that are clustered in dense, spherical formations. The leaves are alternate, simple, and usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in early spring before the leaves emerge. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ecological importance and ornamental features."
