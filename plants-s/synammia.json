    "intro": "Synammia, commonly known as the common thornapple, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its spiny calyx and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Synammia is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it both a notable weed and a subject of botanical study."
