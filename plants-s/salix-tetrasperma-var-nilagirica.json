    "intro": "Salix tetrasperma var. nilagirica, commonly known as the Nilgiri willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas near streams or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
