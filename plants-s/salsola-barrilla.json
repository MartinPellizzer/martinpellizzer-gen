It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, saline environments, often growing in coastal areas and salt marshes. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.
