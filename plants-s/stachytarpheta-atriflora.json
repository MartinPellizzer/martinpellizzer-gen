It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its striking, dark purple to black flowers that contrast with its silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are tubular and clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.
