    "intro": "Styphelia ledifolia, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dense and provide a dense, mat-like growth habit. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. Styphelia ledifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
