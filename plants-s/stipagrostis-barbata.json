    "intro": "Stipagrostis barbata, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipagrostis barbata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
