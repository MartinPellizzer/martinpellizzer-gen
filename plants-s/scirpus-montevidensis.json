    "intro": "Scirpus montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and southern Brazil. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Scirpus montevidensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
