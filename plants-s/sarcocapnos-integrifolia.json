    "intro": "Sarcocapnos integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf sarcocapnos, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and minimal water requirements. Sarcocapnos integrifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
