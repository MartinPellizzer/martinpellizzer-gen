    "intro": "Salix barrattiana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks through its extensive root system."
