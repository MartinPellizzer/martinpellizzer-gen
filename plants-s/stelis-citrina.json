    "intro": "Stelis citrina, commonly known as the yellow-stem orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, often yellowish stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Stelis citrina is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
