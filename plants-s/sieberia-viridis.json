    "intro": "Sieberia viridis, commonly known as the green sieberia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Sieberia viridis is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
