It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving it a weeping effect. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
