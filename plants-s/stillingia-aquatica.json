    "intro": "Stillingia aquatica, commonly known as water stillingia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
