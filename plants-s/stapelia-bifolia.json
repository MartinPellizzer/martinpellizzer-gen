    "intro": "Stapelia bifolia, commonly known as the twin-leaf stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and distinctive, waxy flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically small, opposite, and have a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Stapelia bifolia is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
