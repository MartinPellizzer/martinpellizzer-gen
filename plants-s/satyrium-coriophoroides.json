    "intro": "Satyrium coriophoroides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are usually greenish-white with a slight purple tinge, and it has a short, hairy stem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
