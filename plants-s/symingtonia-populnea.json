    "intro": "Symingtonia populnea, commonly known as the yellow poplar or western yellow poplar, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas. Symingtonia populnea is valued for its fast growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
