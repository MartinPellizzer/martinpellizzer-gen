    "intro": "Steiropteris glandulosa var. brachyodus, commonly known as the short-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and anchors the plant firmly in the soil. The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, contributing to its distinctive appearance and ecological role in its habitat."
