    "intro": "Saxifraga gouanii, commonly known as the Gouan's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are borne on slender stems, often appearing in late summer. Saxifraga gouanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
