    "intro": "Steris nivalis, commonly known as the snow gentian, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, typically growing in rocky soils and meadows. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Steris nivalis is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions, making it a symbol of resilience in mountainous ecosystems."
