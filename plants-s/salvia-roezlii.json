    "intro": "Salvia roezlii, commonly known as the Zambian sage, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance. Salvia roezlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
