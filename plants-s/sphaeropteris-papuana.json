    "intro": "Sphaeropteris papuana, commonly known as the Papuan cyclosorus, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, including Papua New Guinea and parts of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species. Sphaeropteris papuana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
