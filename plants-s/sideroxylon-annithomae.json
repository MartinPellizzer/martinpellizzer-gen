    "intro": "Sideroxylon annithomae, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical fruits containing a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sideroxylon annithomae is considered a vulnerable species."
