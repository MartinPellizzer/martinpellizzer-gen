The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it is known for its ornamental value due to its vibrant, colorful blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stylocoryna harveyi is considered a species of conservation concern."
