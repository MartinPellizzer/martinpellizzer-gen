It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
