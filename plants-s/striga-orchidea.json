    "intro": "Striga orchidea, commonly known as the witch's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, violet-hued flowers that bloom in late winter, often under cloudy or misty conditions. The plant has a delicate, sympodial growth habit with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its root system is specialized, featuring mycorrhizal associations that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Striga orchidea is considered a critically endangered species."
