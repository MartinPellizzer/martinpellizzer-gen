    "intro": "Schkuhria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the valley, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a fragrant, white or pale green flower cluster, which is characteristic of the Gesneriaceae family. Schkuhria pusilla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
