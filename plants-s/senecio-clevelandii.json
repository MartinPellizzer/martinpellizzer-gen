    "intro": "Senecio clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oblong fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
