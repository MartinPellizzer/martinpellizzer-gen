    "intro": "Sphaeralcea tripartita, commonly known as the three-part globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Sphaeralcea tripartita is often found in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
