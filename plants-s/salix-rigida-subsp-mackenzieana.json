    "intro": "Salix rigida subsp. mackenzieana, commonly known as Mackenzie's willow, is a shrub native to the arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and its leaves are small, narrow, and often hairy. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range. Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in cold climates as an ornamental plant."
