    "intro": "Santalodes discolor, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble the ghostly appearance for which it is named. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Santalodes discolor is highly valued in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
