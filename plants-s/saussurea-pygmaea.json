The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces delicate, yellowish flower heads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
