    "intro": "Sclerolaena coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with rough, textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Sclerolaena coriacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
