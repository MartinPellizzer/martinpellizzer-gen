    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved starflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. The leaves are lanceolate, with a narrow, pointed shape, and are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. This variety is closely related to the broader species Saxifraga stellaris, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
