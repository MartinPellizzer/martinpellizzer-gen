    "intro": "Sophoclesia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms during the spring and early summer, producing delicate white or pale pink petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
