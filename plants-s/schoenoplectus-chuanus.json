    "intro": "Schoenoplectus chuanus, commonly known as the Chinese bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland habitats. Schoenoplectus chuanus is also valued for its ability to filter water and support diverse aquatic life."
