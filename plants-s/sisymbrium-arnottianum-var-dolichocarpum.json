    "intro": "Sisymbrium arnottianum var. dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-seed mustard, is a flowering plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, roadside ditches, and other similar habitats. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. The long, slender fruits of this variety are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name."
