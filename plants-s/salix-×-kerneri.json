    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 kerneri, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, round seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adaptable to various soil types and can thrive in moist environments, making it suitable for wetland restoration projects."
