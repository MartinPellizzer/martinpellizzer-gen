    "intro": "Serjania cardiospermoides var. subjubata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, showy red flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
