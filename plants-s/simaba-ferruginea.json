    "intro": "Simaba ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty simaba, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for reforestation and landscaping purposes."
