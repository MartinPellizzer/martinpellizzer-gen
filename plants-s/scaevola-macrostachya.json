    "intro": "Scaevola macrostachya, commonly known as the coastal fairy fan or blue fairy fan, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of blue, purple, and pink. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Scaevola macrostachya is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
