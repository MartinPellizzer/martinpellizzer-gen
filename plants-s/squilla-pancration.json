    "intro": "Squilla pancration, commonly known as the pancratium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are strap-like and narrow, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they emit a mild fragrance to attract pollinators."
