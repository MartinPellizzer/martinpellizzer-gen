    "intro": "Spergula glabra, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Spergula glabra is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural fields."
