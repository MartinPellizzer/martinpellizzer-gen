    "intro": "Schizophyllum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered split-cup mushroom, is a member of the family Tricholomataceae. It is a saprophytic fungus that decomposes wood, primarily found in temperate and subtropical regions. The fruiting bodies are small, with a cap that often splits into distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The spores are released from the gills, which are closely spaced and not decurrent. This species is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems."
