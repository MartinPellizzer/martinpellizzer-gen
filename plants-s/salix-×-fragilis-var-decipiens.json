    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. decipiens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a drooping appearance. It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The plant has slender, flexible stems that can reach lengths of up to 30 meters, supporting narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a finely serrated edge. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
