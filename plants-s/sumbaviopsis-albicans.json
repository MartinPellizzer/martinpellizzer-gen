    "intro": "Sumbaviopsis albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered sumbaviopsis, is a rare tropical plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking white flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the rainforest understory. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
