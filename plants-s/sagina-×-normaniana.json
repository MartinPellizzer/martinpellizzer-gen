    "intro": "Sagina \u00d7 normaniana, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, prostrate growth habit and small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Sagina \u00d7 normaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
