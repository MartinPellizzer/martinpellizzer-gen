    "intro": "Silphium terebinthinaceum, commonly known as the black hellebore, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, waxy, dark green leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a toxic sap that has been historically used in ancient times for medicinal and even contraceptive purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to dry climates. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in its native range."
