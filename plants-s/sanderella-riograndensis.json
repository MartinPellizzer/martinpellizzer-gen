It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Sanderella riograndensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
