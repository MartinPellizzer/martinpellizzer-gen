    "intro": "Sagus filaris, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Sagus filaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
