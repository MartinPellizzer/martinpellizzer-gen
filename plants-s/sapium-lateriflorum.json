    "intro": "Sapium lateriflorum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters along the branches, followed by orange-red berries that are highly ornamental. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value but can become invasive in some regions. The tree is also valued for its wood, which is lightweight and easy to work with."
