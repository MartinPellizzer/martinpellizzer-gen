    "intro": "Spiraea sikokualpina var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth, glabrous surface, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland borders. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
