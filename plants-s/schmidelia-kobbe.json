    "intro": "Schmidelia kobbe, commonly known as the Kobi plant, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stems. Schmidelia kobbe is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened with extinction in the wild."
