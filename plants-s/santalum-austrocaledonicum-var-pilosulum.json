    "intro": "Santalum austrocaledonicum var. pilosulum, commonly known as the Pilosulum sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to New Caledonia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The tree has a distinctive appearance with rough, bark-like foliage and small, clustered leaves. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities."
