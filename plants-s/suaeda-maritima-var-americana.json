    "intro": "Suaeda maritima var. americana, commonly known as American sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats along the Atlantic coast of North America. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
