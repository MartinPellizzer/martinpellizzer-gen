    "intro": "Sporobolus expansus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, pale blue to green flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and dunes. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
