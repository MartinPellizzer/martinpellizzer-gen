    "intro": "Scirpus tabernaemontani var. major, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, grass-like stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale brown flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it thrive in moist or aquatic environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
