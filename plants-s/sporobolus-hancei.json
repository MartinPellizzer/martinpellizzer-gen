    "intro": "Sporobolus hancei, commonly known as Hance's spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Sporobolus hancei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate flooding and poor soil conditions."
