    "intro": "Scutellaria multicaulis subsp. lorinjensis, commonly known as the Lorinjens scutellaria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, clustered in whorls along the stem, and are often surrounded by two small, leaf-like bracts. This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
