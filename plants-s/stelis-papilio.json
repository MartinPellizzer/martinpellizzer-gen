It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-like flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
