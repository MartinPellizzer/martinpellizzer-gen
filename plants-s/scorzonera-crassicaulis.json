It features a robust, fleshy root system that can grow quite deep, often reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of yellow, dandelion-like flowers with reflexed petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Scorzonera crassicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
