    "intro": "Salicornia iranica subsp. rudshurensis, commonly known as Iranian glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran, where it thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes. The plant exhibits succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain water in harsh conditions. It produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. This subspecies is of interest for its potential in phytoremediation and as a source of natural salts."
