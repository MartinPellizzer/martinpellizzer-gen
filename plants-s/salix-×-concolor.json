It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
