    "intro": "Stipa nana, commonly known as dwarf wheatgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale spikelets that are clustered along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Stipa nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
