    "intro": "Selago herbacea, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Selago herbacea plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
