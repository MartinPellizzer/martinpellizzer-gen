It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
