    "intro": "Scirpus melanospermus var. major, commonly known as blackseed bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, seed-filled spikes that give it its common name. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. It is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
