    "intro": "Salvia ampelophylla, commonly known as the rock sage or cliff sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
