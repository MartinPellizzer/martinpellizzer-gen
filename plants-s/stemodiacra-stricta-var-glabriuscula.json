    "intro": "Stemodiacra stricta var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed stemodia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are covered in a fine, almost hairless layer. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
