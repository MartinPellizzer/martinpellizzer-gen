    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. maritima, commonly known as the sea saxifrage, is a hardy, low-growing perennial native to coastal areas of northern Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in late summer. Its leaves are typically succulent, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its resilience and ornamental value."
