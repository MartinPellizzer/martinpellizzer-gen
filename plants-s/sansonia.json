    "intro": "Sansonia, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. The plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that attract pollinators. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Sansonia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
