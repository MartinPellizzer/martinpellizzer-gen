    "intro": "Sedum guadarramicum, commonly known as the Guadarrama sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves that help it store water. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Sedum guadarramicum is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
