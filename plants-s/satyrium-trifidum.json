    "intro": "Satyrium trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key identifying feature. Satyrium trifidum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
