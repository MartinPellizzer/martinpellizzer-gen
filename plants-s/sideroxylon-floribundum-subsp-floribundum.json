    "intro": "Sideroxylon floribundum subsp. floribundum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often greyish bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal forests and riverine woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hard, durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
