It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. While it is not typically cultivated for food, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
