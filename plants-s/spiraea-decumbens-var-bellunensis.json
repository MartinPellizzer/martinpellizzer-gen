    "intro": "Spiraea decumbens var. bellunensis, commonly known as the Bellunense Spirea, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. Its leaves are narrow, elliptical, and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
