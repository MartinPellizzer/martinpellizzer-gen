    "intro": "Salix cladostema, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray bark and slender, branching stems. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, textured surface. Salix cladostema thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and wetlands."
