    "intro": "Sedum smithii, commonly known as Smith's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sedum smithii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
