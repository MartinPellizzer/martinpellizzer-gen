The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and inconspicuous, typically blooming in late summer. This variety is valued for its intense sweetness and is often used as a sugar substitute in culinary and medicinal applications."
