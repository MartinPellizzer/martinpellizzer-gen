    "intro": "Stylidium pingrupense, commonly known as the Pingrup stickvetch, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its unique feature is the presence of a long, slender style that extends beyond the stigma, aiding in pollination. Stylidium pingrupense is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes or open woodlands."
