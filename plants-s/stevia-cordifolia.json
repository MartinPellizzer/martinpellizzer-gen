    "intro": "Stevia cordifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf or Indian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are the primary source of its natural sweetening compounds. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its intense sweetness and low caloric content, it is widely used as a natural alternative to sugar."
