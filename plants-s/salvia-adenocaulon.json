    "intro": "Salvia adenocaulon, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia adenocaulon is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
