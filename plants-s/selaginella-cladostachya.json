    "intro": "Selaginella cladostachya, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. Selaginella cladostachya is also notable for its ability to survive desiccation, a trait that makes it a model organism in studies of plant resilience. Its ancient lineage provides insights into the evolution of early land plants."
