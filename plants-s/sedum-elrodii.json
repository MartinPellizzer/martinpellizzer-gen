    "intro": "Sedum elrodii, commonly known as the Elrod's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for arid landscape designs."
