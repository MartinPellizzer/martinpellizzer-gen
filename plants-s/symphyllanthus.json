    "intro": "Symphyllanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often ephemeral blooms that appear in the early morning and fade by midday. The plant is native to the arid regions of Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures. Symphyllanthus species typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, pale flowers that are often overlooked due to their brief visibility. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and botanical research."
