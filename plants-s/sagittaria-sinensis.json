    "intro": "Sagittaria sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender stems that often extend into shallow water or wetlands. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Sagittaria sinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
