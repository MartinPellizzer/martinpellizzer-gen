    "intro": "Stephanopodium magnifolium, commonly known as the grandleaf starflower, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white and purple. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are broad, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stephanopodium magnifolium is considered a vulnerable species."
