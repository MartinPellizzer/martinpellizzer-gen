    "intro": "Sedum spurium f. splendens, commonly known as the Ice Plant, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
