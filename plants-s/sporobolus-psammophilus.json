    "intro": "Sporobolus psammophilus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy environments. Sporobolus psammophilus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
