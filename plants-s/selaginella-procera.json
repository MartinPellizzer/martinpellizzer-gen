    "intro": "Selaginella procera, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its long, unbranched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, making it one of the tallest members of the spore plant group. The plant features spirally arranged leaves that are typically linear and have a distinct midrib. Selaginella procera thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are located at the apex of the stem, and it produces both microspores and megaspores for sexual reproduction."
