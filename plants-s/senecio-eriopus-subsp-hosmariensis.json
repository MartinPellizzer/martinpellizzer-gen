    "intro": "Senecio eriopus subsp. hosmariensis, commonly known as the Hottentot's beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, ascending stems and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
