    "intro": "Satyrium longicauda var. jacottetianum, commonly known as the Jacottet's long-tailed orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, often pendulous flowers that hang from the stems, displaying a range of colors from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
