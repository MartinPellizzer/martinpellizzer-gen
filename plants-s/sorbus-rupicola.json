    "intro": "Sorbus rupicola, commonly known as the rock pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5\u20139 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
