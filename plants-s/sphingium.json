    "intro": "Sphingium, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique bladder-like structures called traps, which are used to capture small aquatic organisms. Sphingium species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Their leaves are often submerged, while their flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The plant's reproductive structures are adapted for both self-pollination and cross-pollination, depending on the species."
