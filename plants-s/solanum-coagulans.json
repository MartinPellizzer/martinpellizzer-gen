    "intro": "Solanum coagulans, commonly known as the coagulant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, white or purple flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. It produces berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and is primarily found in wild settings."
