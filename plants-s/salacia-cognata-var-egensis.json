    "intro": "Salacia cognata var. egensis, commonly known as the Egen's salacia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible stems that twine around supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its roots are known for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
