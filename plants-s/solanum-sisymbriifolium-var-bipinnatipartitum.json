    "intro": "Solanum sisymbriifolium var. bipinnatipartitum, commonly known as the bipinnately parted nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features compound leaves with a distinctive bipinnate structure, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
