    "intro": "Senecio unionis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and fynbos. It produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Senecio unionis is also noted for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some regions for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
