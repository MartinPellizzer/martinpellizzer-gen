    "intro": "Salix sitchensis var. ralphiana, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
