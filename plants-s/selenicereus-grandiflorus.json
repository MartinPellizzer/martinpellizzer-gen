    "intro": "Selenicereus grandiflorus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a tropical cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. This unique botanical feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
