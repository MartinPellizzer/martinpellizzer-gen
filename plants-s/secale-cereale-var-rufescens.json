    "intro": "Secale cereale var. rufescens, commonly known as red rye, is a variant of rye characterized by its reddish hues in its foliage and grain. It is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, typically found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with florets that mature into grains. It is often used as a forage crop or in traditional farming systems due to its hardiness and adaptability. The reddish coloration of its grains and leaves is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other rye varieties."
