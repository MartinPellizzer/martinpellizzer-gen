    "intro": "Selaginella spinosa, commonly known as the spinous spikemoss, is a species of moss plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophylls. Selaginella spinosa is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
