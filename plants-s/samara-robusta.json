It is characterized by its distinctive samara fruits, which are dry, winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Samara robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and fruit structure."
