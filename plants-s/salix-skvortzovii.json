    "intro": "Salix skvortzovii, commonly known as Skvortzov's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
