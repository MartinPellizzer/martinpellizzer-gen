    "intro": "Sunhangia yunnanensis var. praestans, commonly known as the Yunnan sunhangia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
