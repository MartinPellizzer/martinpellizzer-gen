    "intro": "Styphelia nutans, commonly known as the drooping whorled greenbrier, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, dark red berries. Styphelia nutans thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and thickets. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
