    "intro": "Salix arctica, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is one of the few willow species that grows in polar environments, typically in tundra habitats. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, round berries. Salix arctica plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various Arctic animals."
