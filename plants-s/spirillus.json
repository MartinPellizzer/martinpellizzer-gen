    "intro": "Spirillus, commonly known as the spiral-shaped bacterium, is a genus of bacteria characterized by their unique helical or spiral morphology. These microorganisms are typically found in aquatic environments, soil, and sometimes in association with plants. Spirillus species are often motile, utilizing flagella for movement through their surroundings. They play a role in nutrient cycling and can contribute to the decomposition of organic matter. However, some species may be pathogenic, causing infections in both plants and animals."
