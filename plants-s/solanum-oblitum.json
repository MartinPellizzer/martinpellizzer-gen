    "intro": "Solanum oblitum, commonly known as the forgotten nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine pubescence, while its fruits are typically small, yellow berries. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Solanum oblitum is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
