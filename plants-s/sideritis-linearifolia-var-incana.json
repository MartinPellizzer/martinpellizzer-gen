    "intro": "Sideritis linearifolia var. incana, commonly known as the white-haired ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Sideritis species are known for their medicinal properties, and this variety is no exception, containing compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
