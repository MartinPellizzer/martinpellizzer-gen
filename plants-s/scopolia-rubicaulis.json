    "intro": "Scopolia rubicaulis, commonly known as the red-veined scopolia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves with distinctive red veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, with a strong, often unpleasant fragrance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
