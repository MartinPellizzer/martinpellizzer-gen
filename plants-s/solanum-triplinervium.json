    "intro": "Solanum triplinervium, commonly known as the three-veined nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves with three distinct veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically orange to red in color. Native to South America, it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and is primarily found in the wild."
