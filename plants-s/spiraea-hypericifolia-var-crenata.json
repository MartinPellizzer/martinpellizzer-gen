    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia var. crenata, commonly known as the Creeping Spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has finely toothed, oval leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery-gray pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and foliage, making it a popular choice in horticulture."
