The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, showcasing adaptations to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and sometimes covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
