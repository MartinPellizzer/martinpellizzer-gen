    "intro": "Symplocos ernestii var. pubicalyx, commonly known as the hairy-stalked evergreen holly, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered with fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
