It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a circular pattern around a central stem. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Schefflera myriantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush foliage."
