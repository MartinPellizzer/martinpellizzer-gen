    "intro": "Spathe, commonly known as the leaf-like structure surrounding the spadix in certain flowering plants. It is typically a modified leaf that serves to protect the inflorescence. The spathe is often brightly colored and plays a role in attracting pollinators. It is most commonly associated with plants in the Araceae family, such as peace lilies and calla lilies. The structure can vary in shape and size depending on the species."
