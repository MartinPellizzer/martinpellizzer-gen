    "intro": "Scabiosa pubescens, commonly known as the woolly scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Scabiosa pubescens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
