    "intro": "Stipa meziana, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa meziana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
