    "intro": "Sorghum triticeum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It is often cultivated for its drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soils. However, it is not as widely used for grain production as other sorghum species."
