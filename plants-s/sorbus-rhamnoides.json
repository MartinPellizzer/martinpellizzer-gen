    "intro": "Sorbus rhamnoides, commonly known as the rowan or whitebeams, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters and its distinctive, elongated, red or orange berries that ripen in the fall. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. The plant is also notable for its role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
