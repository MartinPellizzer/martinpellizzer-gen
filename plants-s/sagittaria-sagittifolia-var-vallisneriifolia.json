    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. vallisneriifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water's surface. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil along the edges of ponds and streams."
