    "intro": "Stenanthera gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it plays a role in the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Stenanthera gabonensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes collected for horticultural purposes."
