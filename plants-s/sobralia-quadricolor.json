    "intro": "Sobralia quadricolor, commonly known as the four-color sobralia, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers that display four distinct shades, typically red, yellow, orange, and white, arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sobralia quadricolor is prized in horticulture for its vibrant, showy blooms and unique floral structure."
