    "intro": "Schmidtia anethifolia, commonly known as the anise-leaved grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, anise-scented leaves that are finely divided and resemble those of parsley. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Schmidtia anethifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
