It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
