    "intro": "Sorocephalus pinifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorocephalus, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves, which give it a resemblance to pine trees. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in open habitats such as heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Sorocephalus pinifolius is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
