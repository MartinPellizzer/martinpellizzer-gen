    "intro": "Solanum incanum subsp. schoanum, commonly known as the white hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berry-like fruits, which are typically white or pale yellow when mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption by both humans and animals."
