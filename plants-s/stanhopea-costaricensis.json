    "intro": "Stanhopea costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican Stanhopea, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. The orchid's roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil."
