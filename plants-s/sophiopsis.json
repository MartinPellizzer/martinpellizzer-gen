It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, most notably Sophiopsis capensis. The plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. They typically have woody stems and produce small, clustered flowers. Sophiopsis species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions."
