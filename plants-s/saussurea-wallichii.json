    "intro": "Saussurea wallichii, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow flower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant is adapted to cold and arid environments, with its leaves often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its root system is robust and can extend deep into the soil, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Saussurea wallichii is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine."
