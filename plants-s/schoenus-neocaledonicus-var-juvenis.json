    "intro": "Schoenus neocaledonicus var. juvenis, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
