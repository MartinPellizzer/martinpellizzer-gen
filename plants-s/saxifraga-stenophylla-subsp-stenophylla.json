    "intro": "Saxifraga stenophylla subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments where conditions are harsh. The plant has a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas across Europe, Asia, and North America."
