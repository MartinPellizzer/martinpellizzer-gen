    "intro": "Salvia mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces vibrant violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy surfaces that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Salvia mayebarae is valued in both horticulture and traditional medicine for its ornamental appeal and potential therapeutic properties."
