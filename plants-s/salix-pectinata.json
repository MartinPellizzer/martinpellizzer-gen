    "intro": "Salix pectinata, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a soft, velvety texture. Salix pectinata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
