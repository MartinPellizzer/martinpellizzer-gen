    "intro": "Selliguea engleri, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a perennial fern that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. Selliguea engleri is well adapted to withstand drought and high salinity, making it a hardy species in challenging climates."
