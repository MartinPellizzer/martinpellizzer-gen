    "intro": "Schkuhria wislizeni var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
