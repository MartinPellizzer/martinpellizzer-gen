    "intro": "Semecarpus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone sycamore, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
