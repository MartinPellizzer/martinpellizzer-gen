    "intro": "Sinarundinaria rolloana, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a fern that typically grows in rocky or cliff habitats, often in humid environments. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Sinarundinaria rolloana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
