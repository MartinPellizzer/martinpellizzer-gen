    "intro": "Stelis ninguida, commonly known as the Ninguida orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically features a compact growth habit with clustered pseudobulbs and slender, arching stems. Its flowers are small and often fragrant, displaying a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. Stelis ninguida thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth."
