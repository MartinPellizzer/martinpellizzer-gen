It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, while its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain.
