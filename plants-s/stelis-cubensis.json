    "intro": "Stelis cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It typically grows on tree branches or other plant structures, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features a slender, branched stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Stelis cubensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
