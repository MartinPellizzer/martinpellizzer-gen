    "intro": "Salix alniformis, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically white to pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils and is commonly found near streams, lakes, and wetlands. Salix alniformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
