    "intro": "Senecio coxii, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, and its flowers bloom during the cooler months of the year. Senecio coxii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
