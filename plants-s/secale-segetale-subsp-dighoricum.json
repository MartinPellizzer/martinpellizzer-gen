    "intro": "Secale segetale subsp. dighoricum, commonly known as the Dighoric ryegrass, is a grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a potential forage crop and its ecological adaptability in marginal environments."
