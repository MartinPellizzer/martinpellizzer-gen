    "intro": "Scuticaria hadwenii var. hadwenii, commonly known as the Hadwen's scuticaria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in tropical ecosystems."
