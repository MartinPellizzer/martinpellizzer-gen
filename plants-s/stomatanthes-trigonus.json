    "intro": "Stomatanthes trigonus, commonly known as the three-pointed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the surface. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. The reproductive structures are borne on specialized stalks, and the plant reproduces both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation."
