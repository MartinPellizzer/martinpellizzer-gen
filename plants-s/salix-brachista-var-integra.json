    "intro": "Salix brachista var. integra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wet meadows. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
