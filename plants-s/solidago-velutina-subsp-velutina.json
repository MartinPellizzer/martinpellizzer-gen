    "intro": "Solidago velutina subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and wetlands. It has lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, seed-bearing structures called achenes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
