    "intro": "Scutellaria alpina var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate blue skullcap, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat, often lying close to the ground. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variety is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous habitats."
