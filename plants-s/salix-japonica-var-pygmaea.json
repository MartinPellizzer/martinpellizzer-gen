    "intro": "Salix japonica var. pygmaea, commonly known as Japanese weeping willow, is a compact, ornamental willow species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a weeping appearance, often adorned with small, oval leaves. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water features. Due to its delicate beauty and adaptability, it is a popular choice for garden landscapes."
