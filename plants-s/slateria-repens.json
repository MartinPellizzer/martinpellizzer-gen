    "intro": "Slateria repens, commonly known as creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats over time. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom in early summer. Slateria repens plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
