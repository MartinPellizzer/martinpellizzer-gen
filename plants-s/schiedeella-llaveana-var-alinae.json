    "intro": "Schiedeella llaveana var. alinae, commonly known as the Alinae Schiedeella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elliptical to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecological systems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
