    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon gayanum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate stigmaphyllon, is a low-growing shrub native to the humid forests of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its growth habit is creeping or prostrate, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
