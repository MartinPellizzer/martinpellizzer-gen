    "intro": "Strychnos unguacha var. dysophylla, commonly known as the black mombin, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Loganiaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to red berries. The berries contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp, though the plant is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses."
