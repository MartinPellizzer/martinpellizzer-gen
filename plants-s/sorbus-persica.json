It is characterized by its distinctive white, clustered flowers that appear in spring, followed by small, red-orange berries in autumn. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The bark is grey and fissured, becoming more rugged with age."
