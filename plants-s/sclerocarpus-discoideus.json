    "intro": "Sclerocarpus discoideus, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. The wood of Sclerocarpus discoideus is extremely hard and has been used by indigenous peoples for tools and construction."
