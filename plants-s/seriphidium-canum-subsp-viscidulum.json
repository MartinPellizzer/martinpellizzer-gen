    "intro": "Seriphidium canum subsp. viscidulum, commonly known as sticky horseweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in dry environments."
