    "intro": "Salix interior var. wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's interior willow, is a rare and specialized shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and riparian zones. Its botanical structure includes a slender, multi-stemmed trunk and dense, spreading branches. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
