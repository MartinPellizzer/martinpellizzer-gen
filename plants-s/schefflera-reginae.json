    "intro": "Schefflera reginae, commonly known as the Queen's Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded canopy with clusters of small, dark green leaves that give it a lush appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera reginae is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
