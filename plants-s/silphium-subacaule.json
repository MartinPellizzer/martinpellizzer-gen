    "intro": "Silphium subacaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silphium, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Silphium subacaule was historically valued for its medicinal properties and was once cultivated in ancient Greek and Roman gardens. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
