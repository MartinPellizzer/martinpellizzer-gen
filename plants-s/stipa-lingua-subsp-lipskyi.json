    "intro": "Stipa lingua subsp. lipskyi, commonly known as the Lipsky's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, with elongated lemma-like structures that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
