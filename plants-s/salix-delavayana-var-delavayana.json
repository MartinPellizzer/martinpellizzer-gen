    "intro": "Salix delavayana var. delavayana, commonly known as Delavay's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
