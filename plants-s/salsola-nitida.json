It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Salsola nitida is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and invasive potential."
