    "intro": "Saxifraga nevadensis f. pulchella, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
