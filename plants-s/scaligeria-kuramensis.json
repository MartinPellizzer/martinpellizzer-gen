    "intro": "Scaligeria kuramensis, commonly known as the Kuram mountain scaleria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Georgia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scaligeria kuramensis is considered a vulnerable species."
