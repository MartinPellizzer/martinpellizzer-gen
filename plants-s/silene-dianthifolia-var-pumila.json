    "intro": "Silene dianthifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
