It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
