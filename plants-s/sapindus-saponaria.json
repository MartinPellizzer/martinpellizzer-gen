    "intro": "Sapindus saponaria, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 5 to 11 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits containing several seeds. The fruit's outer layer is covered in a sticky, soapy substance, which gives the plant its common name. This unique feature has led to its use in traditional cleaning practices and as a natural soap substitute."
