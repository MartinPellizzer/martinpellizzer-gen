It features delicate, spirally arranged leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
