It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. Its bulbs are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and easy cultivation. Scilla cordifolia is also valued for its role in naturalizing in woodland settings."
