    "intro": "Stelis hygrophila, commonly known as the water-loving orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant typically features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to retain moisture. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a delicate appearance that enhances its ornamental value. Stelis hygrophila thrives in humid environments and requires consistent moisture and indirect light for optimal growth."
