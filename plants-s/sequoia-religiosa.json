    "intro": "Sequoia religiosa, commonly known as the sacred sequoia, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the high-altitude regions of western North America. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its towering height and thick, fibrous bark. The tree's leaves are scale-like and closely arranged, giving it a dense, evergreen appearance. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
