    "intro": "Sebastiania klotzschiana var. argentina, commonly known as the Argentine beautyberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
