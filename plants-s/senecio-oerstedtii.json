It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
