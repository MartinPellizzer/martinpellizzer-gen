    "intro": "Salpingia, commonly known as the \"pocket orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America and are characterized by their unique, often colorful, and sometimes fragrant flowers. Salpingia species typically have a short, thick rhizome and are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks. Their flowers are often tubular or spurred, with intricate structures that aid in pollination by specific insects. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and unique floral morphology."
