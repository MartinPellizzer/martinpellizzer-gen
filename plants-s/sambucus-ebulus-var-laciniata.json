    "intro": "Sambucus ebulus var. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely lobed, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
