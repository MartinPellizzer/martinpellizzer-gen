    "intro": "Salix nigritina, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a serrated edge, typically turning yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. This species is often found along stream banks and moist soils, contributing to riparian ecosystem stability."
