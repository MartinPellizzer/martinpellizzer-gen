    "intro": "Sterculia diversifolia var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Sterculia, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are large, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while the flowers are clustered in panicles and typically white or pale yellow. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
