    "intro": "Soranthe tenuifolia, commonly known as slender leaf soranthe, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in early summer. Its fibrous roots make it suitable for rocky or well-drained soils. Soranthe tenuifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
