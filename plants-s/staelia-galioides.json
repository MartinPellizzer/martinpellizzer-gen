    "intro": "Staelia galioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated flower spike that blooms in late spring to early summer. Staelia galioides is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
