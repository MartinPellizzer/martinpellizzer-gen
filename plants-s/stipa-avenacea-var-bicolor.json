    "intro": "Stipa avenacea var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored needlegrass, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with the most distinctive feature being its two-toned appearance, as the lemma and palea often display different colors. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
