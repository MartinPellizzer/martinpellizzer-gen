    "intro": "Solanum graveolens, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are toxic when unripe but can be used in cooking once mature. It has hairy, lobed leaves and small white flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
