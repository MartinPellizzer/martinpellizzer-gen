    "intro": "Sedum alpestre var. horakii, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
