    "intro": "Shorea singkawang subsp. scabrosa, commonly known as the Sago palm, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spiky fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often growing in low light conditions under the canopy. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
