    "intro": "Sterculia hewittii, commonly known as the Hewitt's sterculia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. The species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland arid regions."
