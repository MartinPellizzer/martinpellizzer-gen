    "intro": "Stipa lemmonii var. pubescens, commonly known as the Lemmon's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with poor soil. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
