    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides whitlavei, commonly known as the Whitlave's saxifrage, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
