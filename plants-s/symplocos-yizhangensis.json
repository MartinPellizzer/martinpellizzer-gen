    "intro": "Symplocos yizhangensis, commonly known as the Yizhang stoneberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that mature in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
