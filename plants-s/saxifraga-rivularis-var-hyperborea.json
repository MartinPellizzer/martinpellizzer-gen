    "intro": "Saxifraga rivularis var. hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain streams and tundra. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically oval or spatulate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold climates. This variety is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient member of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
