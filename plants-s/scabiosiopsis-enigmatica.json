    "intro": "Scabiosiopsis enigmatica, commonly known as the enigmatic scabious, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scabiosiopsis enigmatica is considered a vulnerable species."
