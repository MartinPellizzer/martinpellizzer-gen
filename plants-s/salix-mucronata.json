    "intro": "Salix mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, often pendulous branches and produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive silvery underside. Salix mucronata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
