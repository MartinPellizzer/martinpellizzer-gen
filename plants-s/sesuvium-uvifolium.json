    "intro": "Sesuvium uvifolium, commonly known as the sea bean or coastal bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and sandy shores. The plant has small, bean-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sesuvium uvifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
