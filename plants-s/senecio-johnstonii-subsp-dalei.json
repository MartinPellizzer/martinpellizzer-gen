It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
