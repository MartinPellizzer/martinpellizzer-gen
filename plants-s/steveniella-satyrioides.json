    "intro": "Steveniella satyrioides, commonly known as the satyr orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble those of the satyr butterfly. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are short and often bear the showy inflorescences. Steveniella satyrioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its beauty and ecological significance."
