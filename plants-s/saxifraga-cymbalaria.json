    "intro": "Saxifraga cymbalaria, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense, erect inflorescences. Saxifraga cymbalaria is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
