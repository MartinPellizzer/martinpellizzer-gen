    "intro": "Strophanthus longicaudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed strophanthus, is a striking climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators. The plant has long, slender stems that can reach several meters in length, often winding around supports. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture. While it is valued for its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
