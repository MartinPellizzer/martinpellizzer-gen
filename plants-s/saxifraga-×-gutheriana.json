    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 gutheriana, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
