    "intro": "Schefflera glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Schefflera glabrata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
