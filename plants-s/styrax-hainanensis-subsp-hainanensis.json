It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lanceolate, glossy green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
