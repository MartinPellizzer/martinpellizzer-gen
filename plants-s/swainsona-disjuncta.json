It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are often bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller, feather-like segments. Swainsona disjuncta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
