It features slender, climbing stems that produce small, light green flowers in late spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and turn reddish in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Smilacina viridiflora is also an important food source for certain pollinators and forest wildlife."
