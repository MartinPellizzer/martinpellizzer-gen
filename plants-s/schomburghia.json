    "intro": "Schomburghia, commonly known as the Schomburghia orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their showy, fragrant flowers. Schomburghia species typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to their unique appearance and relatively easy care, Schomburghia orchids are popular among both novice and experienced growers."
