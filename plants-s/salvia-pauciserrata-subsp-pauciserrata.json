    "intro": "Salvia pauciserrata subsp. pauciserrata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with few, closely spaced teeth. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental gardens and ecological restoration projects."
