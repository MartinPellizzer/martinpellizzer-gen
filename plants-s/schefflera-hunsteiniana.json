    "intro": "Schefflera hunsteiniana, commonly known as the Himalayan schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the ends of the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
