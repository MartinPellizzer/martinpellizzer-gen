    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. atrocinerea, commonly known as black willow or blackleaf willow, is a variant of the silver willow native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dark, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it useful for erosion control and habitat restoration."
