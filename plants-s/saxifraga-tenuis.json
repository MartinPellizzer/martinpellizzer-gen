    "intro": "Saxifraga tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It typically features basal leaves that are narrow and slightly curled, with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices or on rocky slopes. Its compact form and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Saxifraga tenuis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
