It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sporoxeia vietnamensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
