It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Sedum muscoideum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in frost-prone areas."
