    "intro": "Sideritis algarviensis subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Algarve sedge, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in summer. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
