    "intro": "Synthyris borealis, commonly known as the northern synthyris, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in open, rocky habitats. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles. Synthyris borealis plays a role in the ecological balance of its cold environment, contributing to local biodiversity."
