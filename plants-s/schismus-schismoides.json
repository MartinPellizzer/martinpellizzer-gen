    "intro": "Schismus schismoides, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with fleshy, succulent stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern to reduce water loss. Schismus schismoides is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
