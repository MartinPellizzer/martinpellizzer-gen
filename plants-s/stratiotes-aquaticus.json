    "intro": "Stratiotes aquaticus, commonly known as water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into three to five lobes, resembling the shape of a clover leaf. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from June to August. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Stratiotes aquaticus is often used in water gardens and can help in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic life."
