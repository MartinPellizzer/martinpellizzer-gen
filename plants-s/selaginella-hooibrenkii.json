    "intro": "Selaginella hooibrenkii, commonly known as the Hooibrenk's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called strobila. Native to the humid, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and evolutionary significance make it an important subject in the study of plant adaptation and conservation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a vulnerable species."
