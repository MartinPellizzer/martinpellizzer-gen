    "intro": "Santalodes cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge. Santalodes cuspidatum is valued for its fragrant wood, which has been used historically in the production of incense and other aromatic products."
