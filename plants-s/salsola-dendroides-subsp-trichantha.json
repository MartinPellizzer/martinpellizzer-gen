    "intro": "Salsola dendroides subsp. trichantha, commonly known as the sandmat or desert goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its branched, prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by dry, triangular fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and low precipitation. Salsola dendroides subsp. trichantha plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
