    "intro": "Selaginella leptophylla var. wichurae, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in dense, spiral clusters around the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
