    "intro": "Scorpiurus acutifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scorpiurus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Scorpiurus acutifolius is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
