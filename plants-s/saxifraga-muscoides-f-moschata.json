    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides f. moschata, commonly known as the musk saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a dense mat of small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early summer, which emit a subtle musky scent. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
