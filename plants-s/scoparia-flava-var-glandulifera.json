It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and often branched. The variety glandulifera is distinguished by its glandular hairs, which give it a slightly sticky texture."
