    "intro": "Strophanthus dichotomus var. loureiroi, commonly known as the African bloodroot, is a striking plant native to tropical Africa. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and the presence of cardiac glycosides, making it both valuable and dangerous. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
