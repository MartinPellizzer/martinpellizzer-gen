    "intro": "Silene arenarioides, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a hardy species in disturbed or dry habitats. Silene arenarioides is often found in dunes, rocky outcrops, and other xeric environments where it thrives with minimal water."
