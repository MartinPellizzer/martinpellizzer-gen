It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant has silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It typically grows from a short, fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Schizoglossum distinctum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions."
