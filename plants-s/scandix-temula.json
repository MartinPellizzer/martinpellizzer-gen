    "intro": "Scandix temula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy coating. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Scandix temula is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter taste and is often found in riparian habitats."
