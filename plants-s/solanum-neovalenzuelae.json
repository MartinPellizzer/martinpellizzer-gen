    "intro": "Solanum neovalenzuelae, commonly known as the Neovalenzuelan nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, specifically Ecuador. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its flowers are typically white or purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may serve as a food source for certain wildlife. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
