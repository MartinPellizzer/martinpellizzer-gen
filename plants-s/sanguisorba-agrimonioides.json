    "intro": "Sanguisorba agrimonioides, commonly known as the agrimony sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Sanguisorba agrimonioides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
