    "intro": "Salix warburgii var. eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the fragrant willow, is a variant of the Salix warburgii species native to certain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong, aromatic scent, particularly when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found along riverbanks or in wet meadows. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which are typical of willow species. The leaves and branches of this plant are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
