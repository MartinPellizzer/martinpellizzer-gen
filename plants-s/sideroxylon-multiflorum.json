    "intro": "Sideroxylon multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Sideroxylon multiflorum is typically found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable timber used in construction and furniture. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
