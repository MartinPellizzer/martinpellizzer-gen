    "intro": "Salvia apetala, commonly known as the hummingbird sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tubular flowers that are particularly attractive to hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Salvia apetala thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
