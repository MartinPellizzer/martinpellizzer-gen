    "intro": "Stellaria uchiyamana f. apetala, commonly known as the petalless starwort, is a rare and unique variant of the starwort genus. It is characterized by its lack of petals, which is a distinguishing feature from typical members of the genus. This plant is native to specific regions in Japan, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical description includes small, clustered flowers with sepals instead of petals. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and limited distribution."
