    "intro": "Sarcostemma hastatum, commonly known as the creeping milkweed, is a flowering plant native to regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Sarcostemma hastatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
