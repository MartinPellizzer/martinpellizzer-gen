It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny pods containing seeds. Senegalia harleyi is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. It is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
