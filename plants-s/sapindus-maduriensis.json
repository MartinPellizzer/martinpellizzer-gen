    "intro": "Sapindus maduriensis, commonly known as the soapnut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its fruit, which contains a hard, spiny capsule that splits to reveal a cluster of seeds. The tree is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a natural soap substitute due to the saponin content in its seeds."
