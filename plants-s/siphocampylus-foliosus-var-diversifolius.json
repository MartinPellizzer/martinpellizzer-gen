    "intro": "Siphocampylus foliosus var. diversifolius, commonly known as the variable leaf siphocampylus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
