    "intro": "Sorghum rigidifolium, commonly known as rigid-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop in certain regions."
