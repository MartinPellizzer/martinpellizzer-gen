    "intro": "Schizolegnia prolongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It features a slender, creeping rhizome that supports its erect, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically 30\u201360 cm long and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, greenish to brownish spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshes and along stream banks."
