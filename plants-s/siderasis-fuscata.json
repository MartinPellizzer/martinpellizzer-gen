It features upright, slender stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, blooming in late summer. Siderasis fuscata is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
