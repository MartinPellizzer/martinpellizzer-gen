    "intro": "Stachyurus praecox f. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved stachyurus, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in garden settings for its delicate foliage and seasonal interest. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to woodland or shaded gardens."
