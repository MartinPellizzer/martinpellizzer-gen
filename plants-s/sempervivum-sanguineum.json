It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive red or pink hue on the upper surfaces. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum sanguineum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
