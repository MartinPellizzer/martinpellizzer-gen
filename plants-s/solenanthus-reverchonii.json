    "intro": "Solenanthus reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, thriving in the unique microclimate of the island. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solenanthus reverchonii is considered a rare and endemic species."
