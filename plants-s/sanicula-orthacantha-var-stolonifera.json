    "intro": "Sanicula orthacantha var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous sanicle, is a perennial herb native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments. This variety is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
