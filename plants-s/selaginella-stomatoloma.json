    "intro": "Selaginella stomatoloma, commonly known as the toothed clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has whorled leaves that are often scale-like or reduced, and it produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. Its reproductive structures are closely clustered, and it is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Selaginella stomatoloma plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
