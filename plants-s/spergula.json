    "intro": "Spergula, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It typically features small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and fields. Spergula species are generally short-lived perennials, though some may behave as annuals depending on the climate. Its foliage is often used in salads, and it is considered a nutritious forage plant for livestock."
