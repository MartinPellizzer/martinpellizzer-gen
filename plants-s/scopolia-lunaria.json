    "intro": "Scopolia lunaria, commonly known as moonflower or nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has palmate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often growing in rocky or woodland habitats. Scopolia lunaria is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
