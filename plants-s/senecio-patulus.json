    "intro": "Senecio patulus, commonly known as the broadleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
