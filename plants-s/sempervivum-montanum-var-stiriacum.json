    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum var. stiriacum, commonly known as the Alpina Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, known as bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
