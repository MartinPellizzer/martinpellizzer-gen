    "intro": "Stipa turcica, commonly known as Turkish needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Stipa turcica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
