It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact panicles that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces edible grains that are rich in nutrients, including protein and minerals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it a valuable crop for drought-prone regions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for traditional and sustainable agricultural practices."
