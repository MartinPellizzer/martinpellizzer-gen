    "intro": "Sarcanthus stowellianus, commonly known as the Stowell's sarcanthus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific ecological conditions for survival. Its foliage is usually small and elliptical, with a glossy texture, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus stowellianus is considered a conservation concern."
