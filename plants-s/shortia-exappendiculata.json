It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rich woodlands and stream banks. It has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
