    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum zarucchii, commonly known as the cloud forest pine, is a rare and unique conifer native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a conical shape that allows it to withstand strong winds and heavy rainfall. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a key component of the understory in its native habitat. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Sciodaphyllum zarucchii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
