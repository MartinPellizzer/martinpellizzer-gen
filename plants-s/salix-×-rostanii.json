    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rostanii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and has simple, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
