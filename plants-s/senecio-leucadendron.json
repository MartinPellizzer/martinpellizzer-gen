    "intro": "Senecio leucadendron, commonly known as the white candle bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
