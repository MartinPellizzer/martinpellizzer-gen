    "intro": "Struthiopteris hastata, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slightly zigzagged appearance along the rachis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
