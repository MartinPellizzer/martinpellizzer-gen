    "intro": "Stylidium bolgartense, commonly known as the Bolgartense triggerplant, is a small herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive trigger mechanism, which allows the flower to snap shut when touched. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Stylidium bolgartense is known for its unique adaptation to survive in harsh environments."
