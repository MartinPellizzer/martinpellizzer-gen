    "intro": "Schinus areira, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, red drupes that are often mistaken for berries, containing a single seed. Schinus areira is adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions."
