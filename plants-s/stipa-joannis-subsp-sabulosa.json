    "intro": "Stipa joannis subsp. sabulosa, commonly known as the sand grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
