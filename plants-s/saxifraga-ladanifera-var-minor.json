    "intro": "Saxifraga ladanifera var. minor, commonly known as the lesser saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevation. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
