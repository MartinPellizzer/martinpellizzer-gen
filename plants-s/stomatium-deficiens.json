    "intro": "Stomatium deficiens, commonly known as the deficient mouth plant, is a rare and delicate flowering species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique floral structure, which includes a reduced corolla and specialized stamen arrangement. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires careful cultivation due to its sensitivity to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss, Stomatium deficiens is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
