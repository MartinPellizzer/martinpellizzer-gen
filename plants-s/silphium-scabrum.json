    "intro": "Silphium scabrum, commonly known as rough silphium, is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial plant that can grow up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its hairy, ribbed stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by small, spiky fruits. Silphium scabrum is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its latex, which was historically used for its healing and contraceptive effects. Its botanical features make it an important species in both historical and ecological contexts."
