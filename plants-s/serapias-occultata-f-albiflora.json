    "intro": "Serapias occultata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered serapias, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with its greenish-blue foliage. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in rocky, sunny habitats and is often found in limestone areas. The inflorescence consists of a single raceme bearing several small, spurred flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
