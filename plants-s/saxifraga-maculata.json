    "intro": "Saxifraga maculata, commonly known as the spotted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often spotted with red or purple markings, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually pink or white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in early summer. Saxifraga maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
