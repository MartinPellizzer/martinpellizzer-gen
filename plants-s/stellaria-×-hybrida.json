    "intro": "Stellaria \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink star-shaped flowers and a mat-forming growth habit, often found in disturbed soils and along pathways. The plant has thin, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Stellaria \u00d7 hybrida is often considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
