    "intro": "Sarcochilus microscopicus, commonly known as the microscopic sarcochilus, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the humid rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and a single, slender flowering spike that produces tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their minute size, making it a challenging species to identify. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Sarcochilus microscopicus is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
