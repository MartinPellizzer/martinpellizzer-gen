It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets, and its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry to moist tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty and medicinal properties. Senna domingensis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported laxative effects."
