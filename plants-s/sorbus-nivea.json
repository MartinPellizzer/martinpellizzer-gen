    "intro": "Sorbus nivea, commonly known as the white rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. Sorbus nivea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
