    "intro": "Sphaeralcea scoparia, commonly known as desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea scoparia is also known for its spherical, woolly seed pods that persist on the plant well into the winter."
