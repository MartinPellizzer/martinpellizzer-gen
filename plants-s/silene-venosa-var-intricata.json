    "intro": "Silene venosa var. intricata, commonly known as the intricate bluetail, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bluish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
