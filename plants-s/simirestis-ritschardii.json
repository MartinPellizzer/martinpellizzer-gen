    "intro": "Simirestis ritschardii, commonly known as the Ritschard's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often with a pale or translucent appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks or branches of trees, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in the early morning, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
