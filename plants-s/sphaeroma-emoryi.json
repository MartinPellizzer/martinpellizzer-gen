    "intro": "Sphaeroma emoryi, commonly known as the Emory's sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in marine environments along the western Atlantic coast. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a thin layer of mucus. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead relying on its radula for feeding on algae and other organic matter. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in shallow, tide pool habitats where it can avoid strong currents."
