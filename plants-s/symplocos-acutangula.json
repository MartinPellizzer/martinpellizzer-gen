    "intro": "Symplocos acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-leaved inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are sharply pointed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats. Symplocos acutangula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
