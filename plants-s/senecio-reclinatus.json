    "intro": "Senecio reclinatus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of gray-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion puffs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Senecio reclinatus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
