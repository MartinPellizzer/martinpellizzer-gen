    "intro": "Saxifraga latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hair. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. Saxifraga latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
