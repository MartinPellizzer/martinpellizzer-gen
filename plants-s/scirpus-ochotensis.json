    "intro": "Scirpus ochotensis, commonly known as the Far Eastern bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered with a fine layer of hair, and its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like. Scirpus ochotensis produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
