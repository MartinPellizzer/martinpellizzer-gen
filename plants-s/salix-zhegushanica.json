    "intro": "Salix zhegushanica, commonly known as Zhegushan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are a key feature for identification. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
