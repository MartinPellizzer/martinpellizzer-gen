    "intro": "Senecio pichineuquensis, commonly known as the Pichineuqu\u00e9n senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and grasslands, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
