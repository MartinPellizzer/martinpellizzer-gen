It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rich soils in woodland areas. Its historical use by Native American tribes included medicinal applications for various ailments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a rare and endangered species."
