    "intro": "Simaba cedron, commonly known as ceiba or ceib\u00e1, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The tree produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation. The plant is also valued for its wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
