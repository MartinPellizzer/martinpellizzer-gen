    "intro": "Scaphespermum trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, and its clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Scaphespermum trilobum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
