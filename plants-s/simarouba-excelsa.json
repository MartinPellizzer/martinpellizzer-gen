It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes many valuable hardwood species. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-like canopy and dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. The wood of Simarouba excelsa is highly prized for its durability and fine grain, though it is also valued for its ecological role in tropical forests."
