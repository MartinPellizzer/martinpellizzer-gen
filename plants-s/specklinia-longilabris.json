    "intro": "Specklinia longilabris, commonly known as the long-labied staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a lithophytic epiphyte, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical environments. The plant features a thick, leathery frond with a broad, shield-shaped base and a long, narrow, serrated terminal leaf. Its rhizome is robust and produces adventitious roots that anchor it to its substrate. The fronds are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a distinctive, fuzzy appearance."
