    "intro": "Senecio schistosus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, resembling a dandelion. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Senecio schistosus is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
