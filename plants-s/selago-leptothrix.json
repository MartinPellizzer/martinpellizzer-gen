    "intro": "Selago leptothrix, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Selago leptothrix plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
