    "intro": "Solanum fragile, commonly known as the brittle nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. Solanum fragile thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
