    "intro": "Scirpus strictus, commonly known as common bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes and roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments. Scirpus strictus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
