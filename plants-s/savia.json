    "intro": "Savia, commonly known as the \"bloodroot\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and distinctive, often reddish, sap that can be toxic. The plant typically features simple, alternate leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Savia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its toxic sap and medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
