    "intro": "Secale iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian rye or Persian rye, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species compared to other rye varieties."
