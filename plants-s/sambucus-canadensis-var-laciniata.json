    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis var. laciniata, commonly known as the fragrant elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
