    "intro": "Salix cordata f. pseudomackenziana, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a botanical variant of the narrowleaf willow species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant is native to regions of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, often riparian habitats. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. This form is noted for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
