    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 doerfleri, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and pale green to almost translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
