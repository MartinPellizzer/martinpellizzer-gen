    "intro": "Sarcanthus linearilobatus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed sarcanthus, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in well-drained soils. Sarcanthus linearilobatus is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
