It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Its foliage and fruit are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The glandular hairs on its leaves contribute to its unique appearance and may play a role in its ecological interactions."
