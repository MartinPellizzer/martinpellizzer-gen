    "intro": "Santolina tuberculosa, commonly known as the woolly santolina, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, fuzzy foliage that is both drought-tolerant and heat-resistant, making it well-suited for rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Santolina tuberculosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
