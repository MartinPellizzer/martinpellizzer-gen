    "intro": "Salvia medusa, commonly known as the Medusa sage, is a striking perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, velvety gray-green foliage. The plant produces striking purple or violet flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its unique appearance, reminiscent of the mythological Medusa, has made it a popular choice in ornamental gardens. Salvia medusa prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers."
