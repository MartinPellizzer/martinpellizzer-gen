It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland edges or meadows. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in gardens and conservation areas."
