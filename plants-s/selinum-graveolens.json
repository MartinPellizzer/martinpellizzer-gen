    "intro": "Selinum graveolens, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a biennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are often used in herbal medicine and as a spice, though they are toxic in large quantities. The plant is also noted for its strong, aromatic odor and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
