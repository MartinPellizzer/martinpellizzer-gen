    "intro": "Salvia campestris, commonly known as meadow sage, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia campestris is also valued for its aromatic leaves and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
