    "intro": "Stelis sarcodantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
