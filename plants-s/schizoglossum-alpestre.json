    "intro": "Schizoglossum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions. Schizoglossum alpestre is also noted for its resilience to harsh weather and its ability to bloom even in low-nutrient soils."
