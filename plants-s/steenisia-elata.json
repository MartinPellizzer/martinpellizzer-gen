    "intro": "Steenisia elata, commonly known as the tall cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, slow-growing plant that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, characterized by its palm-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Steenisia elata is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
