    "intro": "Struthiopteris sessilifolia, commonly known as the barren woodsorrel, is a perennial fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are directly attached to the stem."
