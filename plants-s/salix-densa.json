    "intro": "Salix densa, commonly known as the dense willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix densa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
