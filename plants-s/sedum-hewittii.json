    "intro": "Sedum hewittii, commonly known as the Hewitt\u2019s stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the summer months. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert regions. Sedum hewittii is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
