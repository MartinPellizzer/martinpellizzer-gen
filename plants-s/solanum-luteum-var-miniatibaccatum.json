    "intro": "Solanum luteum var. miniatibaccatum, commonly known as the miniature yellow nightshade, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features small, yellow-orange berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, which are characteristic of the Solanaceae family. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowering stems are often branched. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, like other members of the nightshade family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
