    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa pubens, commonly known as the hairy elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often hairy, and its clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible when ripe, though they are generally considered toxic in their raw form. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and streamside areas. Sambucus racemosa pubens plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
