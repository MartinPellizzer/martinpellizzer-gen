It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and alternate, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruits are slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
