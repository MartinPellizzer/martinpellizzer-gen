It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, spirally arranged orange or reddish-orange flowers.

Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological specificity."
