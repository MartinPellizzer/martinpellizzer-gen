    "intro": "Sporobolus copei, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Sporobolus copei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
