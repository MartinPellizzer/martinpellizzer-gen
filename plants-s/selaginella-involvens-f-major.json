    "intro": "Selaginella involvens f. major, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Selaginellaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form dense, compact rosettes. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
