    "intro": "Selaginella tama-montana, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around the stems, forming a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella tama-montana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
