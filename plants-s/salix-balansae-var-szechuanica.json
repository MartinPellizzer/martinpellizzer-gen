    "intro": "Salix balansae var. szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and green on top with a silvery underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
