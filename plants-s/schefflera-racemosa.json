    "intro": "Schefflera racemosa, commonly known as the clustered umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Schefflera racemosa thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and landscape purposes."
