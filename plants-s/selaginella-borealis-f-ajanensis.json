    "intro": "Selaginella borealis f. ajanensis, commonly known as the Arctic spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to the Arctic tundra. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its structure includes a root system and a stem with whorled leaves, typical of the spore-bearing plants. Selaginella borealis f. ajanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for Arctic flora and fauna."
