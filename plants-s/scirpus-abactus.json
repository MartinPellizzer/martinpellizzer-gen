    "intro": "Scirpus abactus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color, and it blooms from late summer to early fall. Scirpus abactus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the ecological structure of wetland environments."
