    "intro": "Scirpus setaceus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf tussock sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, giving it a distinctive, compact appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish-brown in color, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or freshwater marshes. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
