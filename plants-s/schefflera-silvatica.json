    "intro": "Schefflera silvatica, commonly known as the silver schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has dark green, glossy foliage that can grow up to 15 cm in length, with a leathery texture. Schefflera silvatica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. It is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in landscaping due to its attractive foliage."
