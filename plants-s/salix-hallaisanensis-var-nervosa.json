    "intro": "Salix hallaisanensis var. nervosa, commonly known as the Korean weeping willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to Korea. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, typical of many weeping willow species. The leaves are elongated, narrow, and have a distinctive venation pattern that gives the variety its name, \"nervosa,\" meaning \"nerved.\" It thrives in moist environments, often found near rivers and streams, and prefers well-drained soil. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in landscaping for its graceful, flowing form."
