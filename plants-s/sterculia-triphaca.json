    "intro": "Sterculia triphaca, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, lobed leaves. The tree produces showy, cream-colored flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
