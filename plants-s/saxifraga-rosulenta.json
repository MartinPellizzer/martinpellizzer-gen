    "intro": "Saxifraga rosulenta, commonly known as the rosette saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that form a tight cluster near the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga rosulenta is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience."
