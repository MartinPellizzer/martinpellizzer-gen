    "intro": "Salix savatieri, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are simple, lance-shaped, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, woody capsules that contain seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along waterways."
