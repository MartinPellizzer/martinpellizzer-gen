    "intro": "Scirpus spadiceus var. ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a distinctive hairy texture along the edges. This variety thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies."
