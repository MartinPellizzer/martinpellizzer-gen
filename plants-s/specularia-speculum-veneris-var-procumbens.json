    "intro": "Specularia speculum-veneris var. procumbens, commonly known as the Venus' looking-glass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, reflective hairs, giving it a shimmering appearance. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique foliage and floral display make it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
