    "intro": "Sabulina sphagnoides, commonly known as the sand moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, sandy environments. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow stems and small, overlapping leaves that form a dense carpet. This plant is typically found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and other well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Sabulina sphagnoides plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
