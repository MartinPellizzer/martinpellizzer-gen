It consists of several species, primarily native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Seguieria species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They have thick, waxy leaves and produce capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds."
