    "intro": "Sericolea micans var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sericolea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The smooth, hairless texture of its stems and leaves distinguishes this variety from other forms of Sericolea micans."
