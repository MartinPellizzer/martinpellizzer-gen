It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers followed by orange or red berries containing toxic seeds. Its sap contains cardioactive alkaloids, which have been historically used in arrow poison and medicinal preparations. Due to its toxicity, handling the plant requires caution."
