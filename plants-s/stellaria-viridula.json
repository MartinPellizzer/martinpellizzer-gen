    "intro": "Stellaria viridula, commonly known as green starwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which is characteristic of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the plant often grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadsides. Stellaria viridula is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
