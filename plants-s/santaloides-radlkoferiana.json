    "intro": "Santaloides radlkoferiana, commonly known as the Radlkofer's sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in lowland forests. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption."
