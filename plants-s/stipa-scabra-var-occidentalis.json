    "intro": "Stipa scabra var. occidentalis, commonly known as western rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
