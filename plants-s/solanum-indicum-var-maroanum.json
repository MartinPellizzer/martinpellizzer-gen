    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. maroanum, commonly known as the Madagascar nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
