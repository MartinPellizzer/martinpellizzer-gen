    "intro": "Sempervivum glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh conditions, including drought and frost."
