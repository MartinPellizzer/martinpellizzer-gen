    "intro": "Salix vagans var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
