It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically light green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more robust than the male ones. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
