It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thorny stems and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
