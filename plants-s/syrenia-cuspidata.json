    "intro": "Syrenia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing along shores and in brackish water areas. Its flowers bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Syrenia cuspidata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
