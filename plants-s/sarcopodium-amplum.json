    "intro": "Sarcopodium amplum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a robust, fibrous root system that helps stabilize the substrate and prevent erosion. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically blooming in late summer, followed by the production of distinctive, spiraled fruits. Sarcopodium amplum thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds."
