    "intro": "Stenophyllus capillaris f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leafed capillary fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. The plant's fronds are usually slender and exhibit a distinctive, almost grass-like appearance, which sets it apart from other fern species. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often of interest to horticulturists and botanists."
