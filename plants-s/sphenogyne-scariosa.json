    "intro": "Sphenogyne scariosa, commonly known as the scaly sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, scaly foliage and intricate floral structure, which includes a prominent, showy lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are often pale green or white with subtle markings. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sphenogyne scariosa is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
