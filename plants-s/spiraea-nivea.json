    "intro": "Spiraea nivea, commonly known as snowbank spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they turn a striking reddish-purple in the fall. Spiraea nivea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
