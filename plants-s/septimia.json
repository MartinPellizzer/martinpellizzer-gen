It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain the toxic alkaloid solanin. Septimia is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
