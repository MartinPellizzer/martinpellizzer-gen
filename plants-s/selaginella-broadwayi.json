    "intro": "Selaginella broadwayi, commonly known as the Broadway spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of needle-like leaves and distinctive spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires protected status to ensure its survival."
