    "intro": "Sideritis glacialis subsp. vestita, commonly known as the glacier sedge, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
