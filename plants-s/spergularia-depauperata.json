    "intro": "Spergularia depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's grass, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal and inland dunes. Spergularia depauperata is adapted to harsh environments, showing tolerance to salt and drought conditions. Its simple morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of pioneer plant communities in disturbed habitats."
