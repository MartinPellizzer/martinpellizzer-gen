    "intro": "Solanum canasense var. intihuatanense, commonly known as the Huayna Picchu nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
