    "intro": "Stelis roseopunctata, commonly known as the rose-punctured orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink with distinctive rose-colored spots. Its leaves are usually clustered and can be either linear or ovate in shape. Stelis roseopunctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific care requirements."
