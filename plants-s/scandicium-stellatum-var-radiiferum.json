    "intro": "Scandicium stellatum var. radiiferum, commonly known as the star-like radiance fern, is a strikingly ornamental plant characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a unique botanical feature with its radiating leaflets that give it a luminous appearance, especially when backlit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The varietal name \"radiiferum\" refers to its tendency to emit a subtle, shimmering effect under light. This variant is noted for its slow growth and requires consistent humidity to maintain its vibrant foliage."
