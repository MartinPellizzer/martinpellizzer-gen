    "intro": "Sideroxylon cymosum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Sideroxylon cymosum is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
