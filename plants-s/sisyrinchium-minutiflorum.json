    "intro": "Sisyrinchium minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf blue-eyed grass, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact size and vibrant color make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Sisyrinchium minutiflorum is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
