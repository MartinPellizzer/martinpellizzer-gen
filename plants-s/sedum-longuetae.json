    "intro": "Sedum longuetae, commonly known as the long-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, often branching out to form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Sedum longuetae thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
