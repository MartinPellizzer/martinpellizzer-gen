    "intro": "Smilax biflora var. trinervula, commonly known as the three-veined smilax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth, typical of many smilax species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are usually clustered in umbels. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with three distinct leaflets, giving it the \"trinervula\" designation. It is native to parts of the southeastern United States and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
