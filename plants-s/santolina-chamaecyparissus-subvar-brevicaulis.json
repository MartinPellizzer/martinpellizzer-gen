    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subvar. brevicaulis, commonly known as the compact santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, needle-like leaves that are aromatic and drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring, which are borne on short, branched stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its compact form and hardy nature. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
