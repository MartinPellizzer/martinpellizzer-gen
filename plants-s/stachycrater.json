These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with erect or decumbent stems. The leaves are often lanceolate or ovate, and the flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences. Stachycrater species are characterized by their bract-like structures and showy, often pink or red flowers. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
