    "intro": "Sorbus camschatcensis, commonly known as the Kamchatka rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and often have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The berries are an important food source for birds and mammals in its native range."
