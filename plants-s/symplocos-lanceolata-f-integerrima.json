    "intro": "Symplocos lanceolata f. integerrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf wax myrtle, is a variant of the wax myrtle species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This form is distinguished by its more uniformly smooth leaf surface compared to other forms of Symplocos lanceolata."
