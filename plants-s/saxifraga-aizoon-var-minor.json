    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. minor, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand extreme temperatures make it a hardy and resilient species."
