    "intro": "Statice armeria var. maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant features dense clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are evergreen, providing year-round interest. Sea thrift is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in maritime gardens."
