    "intro": "Stylidium armeria, commonly known as the red-stemmed triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive red stems and bright orange or red flowers. The plant has a short, erect habit with linear leaves and produces small, spurred flowers that attract insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Stylidium armeria is known for its unique mechanism of seed dispersal, where the fruit explosively ejects seeds when mature."
