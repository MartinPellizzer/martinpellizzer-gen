    "intro": "Salix viminalis var. pubera, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a variant of the common osier willow. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems, which give it its botanical name. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as riverbanks and marshes. Its flexible branches have historically been used for basket-making and other crafts."
