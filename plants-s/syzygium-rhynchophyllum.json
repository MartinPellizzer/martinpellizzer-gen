    "intro": "Syzygium rhynchophyllum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, aromatic qualities, though it is also threatened by overharvesting. Syzygium rhynchophyllum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting diverse flora and fauna."
