    "intro": "Solanum jatrophifolium, commonly known as the jatropha-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that resemble those of jatropha species. Its flowers are typically white or purple, and it produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
