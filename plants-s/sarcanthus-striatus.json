    "intro": "Sarcanthus striatus, commonly known as the striped spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves with a waxy coating and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, a common trait among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
