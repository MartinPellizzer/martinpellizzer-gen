    "intro": "Sisyrinchium nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, although it is often classified in the family Iridaceae due to its showy, iris-like flowers. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the tips of its grass-like stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks. Sisyrinchium nuttallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
