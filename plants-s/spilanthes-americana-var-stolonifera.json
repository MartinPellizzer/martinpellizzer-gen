    "intro": "Spilanthes americana var. stolonifera, commonly known as stoloniferous false mustards, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes and help in spreading. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant is known for its strong, pungent odor and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
