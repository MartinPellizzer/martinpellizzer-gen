    "intro": "Spergula arvensis var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky layer. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also serve as a valuable forage plant for livestock."
