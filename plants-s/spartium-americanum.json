    "intro": "Spartium americanum, commonly known as American needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, bristly seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Spartium americanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
