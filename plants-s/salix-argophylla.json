    "intro": "Salix argophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silver-gray foliage. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a rough, sandpapery texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian habitats."
