It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
