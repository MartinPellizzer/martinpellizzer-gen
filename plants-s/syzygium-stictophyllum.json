    "intro": "Syzygium stictophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The tree produces woody pods containing edible, sour-tasting seeds, which are used in traditional Aboriginal cuisine. Syzygium stictophyllum is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
