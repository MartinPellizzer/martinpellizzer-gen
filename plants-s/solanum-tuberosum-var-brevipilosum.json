    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. brevipilosum, commonly known as the short-hairy potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other potato varieties. This plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to the Andes region of South America. It produces tubers that are typically smaller than those of the standard potato variety. The short-hairy potato is primarily of interest to botanists and plant breeders due to its unique morphological traits."
