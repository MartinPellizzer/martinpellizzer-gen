    "intro": "Sphinga acatlensis, commonly known as the Mexican ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its pale, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Sphinga acatlensis is considered a critically endangered species."
