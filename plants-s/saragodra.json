It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a range of colors, from white to deep red. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Saragodra plays a significant role in the cultural and spiritual practices of the local communities."
