    "intro": "Sphenodesme clemensiorum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and produce small, clustered yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Sphenodesme clemensiorum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
