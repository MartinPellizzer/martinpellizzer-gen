    "intro": "Salsola vermiculata subsp. villosa, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Salsola vermiculata subsp. villosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
