    "intro": "Shorea maritima, commonly known as the mangrove shorea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove forests. The tree has a robust, buttressed root system that helps it survive in saline and waterlogged soils. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. Shorea maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
