    "intro": "Spananthe paniculata var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it capture moisture from the air. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
