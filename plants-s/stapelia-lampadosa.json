    "intro": "Stapelia lampadosa, commonly known as the \"Cape Town star\" or \"star stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with red or orange markings. The plant produces fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers open in the evening and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia lampadosa is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
