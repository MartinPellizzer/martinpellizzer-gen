    "intro": "Sempervivum globiferum subsp. allionii, commonly known as the Allion's houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces compact, branched inflorescences with small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, though it prefers cool, sunny conditions."
