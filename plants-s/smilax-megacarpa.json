    "intro": "Smilax megacarpa, commonly known as the giant arrowroot or large-fruited smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of sharp, recurved spines along its stems. The plant produces large, palmate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a reddish, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Smilax megacarpa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and swamps, where it thrives in the understory."
