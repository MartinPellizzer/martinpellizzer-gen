    "intro": "Salicornia bergii, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and arid regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Salicornia bergii is often found in salt marshes, estuaries, and along tidal shores, contributing to coastal ecosystem stability."
