    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features basal rosettes of rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in a cluster at the end of the stem. Saxifraga pensylvanica is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments."
