    "intro": "Stachys arenaria subsp. divaricatidens, commonly known as the sand betony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, hairy leaves that are often curled or rolled to reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, typically arranged in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
