    "intro": "Syzygium claviflorum var. maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's apple or white apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Syzygium claviflorum."
