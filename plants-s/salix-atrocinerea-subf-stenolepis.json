    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea subf. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and narrow, dark green leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is often fissured and dark in color, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
