    "intro": "Saccolabium rupestre, commonly known as the rock sage or desert sage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Saccolabium rupestre is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
