    "intro": "Sedum bhutanense, commonly known as the Bhutan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Sedum bhutanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh mountain climates."
