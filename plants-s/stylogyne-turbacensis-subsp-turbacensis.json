    "intro": "Stylogyne turbacensis subsp. turbacensis, commonly known as the bog lily, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and other waterlogged soils, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its leaves are linear and often submerged or floating, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the base of the plant. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
