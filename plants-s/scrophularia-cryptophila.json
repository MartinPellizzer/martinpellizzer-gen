    "intro": "Scrophularia cryptophila, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Scrophularia cryptophila is considered a vulnerable species."
