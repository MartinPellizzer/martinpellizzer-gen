It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect sunlight. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
