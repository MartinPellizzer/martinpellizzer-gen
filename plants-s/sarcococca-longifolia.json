    "intro": "Sarcococca longifolia, commonly known as the fragrant winter jasmine, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent foliage and winter blooms."
