    "intro": "Struthiopteris spicant var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variety of the common wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, spore-bearing structure called a sori. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a notched or lobed appearance, and they have a dark green, leathery texture. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological and horticultural interest."
