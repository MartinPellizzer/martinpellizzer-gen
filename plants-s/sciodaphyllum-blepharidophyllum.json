    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum blepharidophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. This fern is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf bases, a feature that aids in its survival in competitive forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum blepharidophyllum is considered a vulnerable species."
