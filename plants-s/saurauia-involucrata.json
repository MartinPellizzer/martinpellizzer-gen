    "intro": "Saurauia involucrata, commonly known as the woolly mitten tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing insulation in cold climates. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Saurauia involucrata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
