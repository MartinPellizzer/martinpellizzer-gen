    "intro": "Stipa echinata, commonly known as the prickly grass or stiff beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of short, bristle-tipped lemma-like structures. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. Its foliage is narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Stipa echinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and architectural form."
