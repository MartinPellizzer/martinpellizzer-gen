    "intro": "Santalum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is native to northern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and fine furniture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, tropical, and subtropical regions."
