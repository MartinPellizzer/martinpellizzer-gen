    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. fragilis, commonly known as slender starwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat on the ground. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. This variant is distinguished by its fragile stems and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
