    "intro": "Struthanthus porrectus, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening and close by morning, a characteristic adaptation to its desert habitat. Its leaves are linear and succulent, helping to conserve water in dry conditions. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
