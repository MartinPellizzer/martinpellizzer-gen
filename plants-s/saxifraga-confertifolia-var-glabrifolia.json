    "intro": "Saxifraga confertifolia var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features erect stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add color to high-altitude gardens."
