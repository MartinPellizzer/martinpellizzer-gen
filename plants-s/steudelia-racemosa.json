    "intro": "Steudelia racemosa, commonly known as the California goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as coastal bluffs and sandy soils. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Steudelia racemosa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
