    "intro": "Stenolobium caeruleum var. villosius, commonly known as the hairy bluewood, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its varietal name \"villosius.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal and coastal garden landscapes due to its salt tolerance. The hairy bluewood is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
