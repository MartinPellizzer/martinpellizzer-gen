It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and usually have a bluish-green sheen, which gives the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
