It typically features prostrate or ascending stems covered in small, ovate leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
