    "intro": "Scobinaria verrucosa, commonly known as the rough scobinaria, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its branched stems and compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Scobinaria verrucosa is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance."
