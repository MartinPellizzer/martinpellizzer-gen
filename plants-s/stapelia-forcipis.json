    "intro": "Stapelia forcipis, commonly known as the deadly nightshade plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and distinctive, meaty-looking flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Stapelia forcipis is known for its slow growth and ability to store water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
