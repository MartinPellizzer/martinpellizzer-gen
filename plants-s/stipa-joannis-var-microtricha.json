    "intro": "Stipa joannis var. microtricha, commonly known as the dwarf feathergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
