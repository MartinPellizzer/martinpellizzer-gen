    "intro": "Salix lucida var. lasiandra, commonly known as the white willow or narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The leaves are often covered with a fine, silky white coating, giving the plant its common name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are cylindrical flower clusters that contain both male and female flowers. This species is often found in moist soils near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks."
