    "intro": "Sclarea glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky angelica, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Sclarea glutinosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
