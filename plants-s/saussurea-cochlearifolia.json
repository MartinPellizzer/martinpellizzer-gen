    "intro": "Saussurea cochlearifolia, commonly known as the crested or golden saffron, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and other high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
