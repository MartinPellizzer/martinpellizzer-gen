    "intro": "Stylocline filaginea var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf velvetleaf, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
