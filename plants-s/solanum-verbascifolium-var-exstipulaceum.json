    "intro": "Solanum verbascifolium var. exstipulaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically bell-shaped, with a distinctive purple or violet hue, and appear in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that contain the toxic alkaloids typical of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or wildflower displays."
