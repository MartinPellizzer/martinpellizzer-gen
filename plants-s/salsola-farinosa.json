    "intro": "Salsola farinosa, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing annual or biennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has small, fleshy, spine-tipped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. Salsola farinosa is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, dry conditions."
