    "intro": "Solanum brachistotrichum var. ripicola, commonly known as the rock nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy stems, and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers, followed by small, round berries that are typically yellow when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans."
