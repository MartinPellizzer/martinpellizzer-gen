    "intro": "Stephegyne tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Stephegyne tubulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
