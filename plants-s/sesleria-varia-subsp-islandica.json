    "intro": "Sesleria varia subsp. islandica, commonly known as the island sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. It has a low-growing habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Sesleria varia."
