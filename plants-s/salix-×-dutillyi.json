The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
