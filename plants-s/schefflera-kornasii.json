    "intro": "Schefflera kornasii, commonly known as the Kornasii umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal. Schefflera kornasii prefers well-draining soil and indirect sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
