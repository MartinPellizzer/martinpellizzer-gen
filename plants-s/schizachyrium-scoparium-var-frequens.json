    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium var. frequens, commonly known as eastern grassland panicum, is a native North American grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades. It produces feathery panicles of small, light green to golden flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. This variety is more densely tufted than the typical form, making it a desirable ornamental in native plant gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in restoration projects."
