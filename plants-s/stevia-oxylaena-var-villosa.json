    "intro": "Stevia oxylaena var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is valued for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high levels of steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. This species is often cultivated for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
