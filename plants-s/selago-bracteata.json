It is characterized by its striking silver-white leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which gives it its common name. Selago bracteata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
