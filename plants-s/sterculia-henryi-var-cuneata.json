    "intro": "Sterculia henryi var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sterculia, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies."
