    "intro": "Saribus mariae, commonly known as the Maria's palm, is a species of palm native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. Saribus mariae thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
