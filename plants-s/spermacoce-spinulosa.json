    "intro": "Spermacoce spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases tiny seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Spermacoce spinulosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
