It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Sesbania hirtistyla is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
