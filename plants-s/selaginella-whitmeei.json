    "intro": "Selaginella whitmeei, commonly known as the White's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures that produce spores. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with the strobilus containing microsporangia and megasporangia for sexual reproduction. Selaginella whitmeei plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
