    "intro": "Scaphium velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
