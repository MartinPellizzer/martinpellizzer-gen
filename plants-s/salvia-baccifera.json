    "intro": "Salvia baccifera, commonly known as black sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in traditional medicine and herbal remedies. Salvia baccifera is also used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
