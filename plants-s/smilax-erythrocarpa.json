    "intro": "Smilax erythrocarpa, commonly known as red-fruited smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible when fully ripe and are often consumed by wildlife. Smilax erythrocarpa is adapted to wetland and swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
