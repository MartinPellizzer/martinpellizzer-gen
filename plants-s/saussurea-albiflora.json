    "intro": "Saussurea albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered saussurea, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a stout, woody stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often branching near the top. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Saussurea albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
