It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Smilax fortunensis is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade."
