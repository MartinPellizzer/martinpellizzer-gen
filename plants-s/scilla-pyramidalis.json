    "intro": "Scilla pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize easily. Scilla pyramidalis is also valued for its role in supporting early pollinators in the ecosystem."
