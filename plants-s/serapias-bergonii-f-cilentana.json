    "intro": "Serapias bergonii f. cilentana, commonly known as the Cilentan orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the limestone-rich regions of southern Italy. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and rock crevices. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, and it plays a role in the unique ecological balance of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
