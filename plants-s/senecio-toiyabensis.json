    "intro": "Senecio toiyabensis, commonly known as the Toiyabene groundsels, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio toiyabensis is known for its resilience to drought and is often found in desert ecosystems."
