    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy orange-red berries. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in inflorescences, while the fleshy, brightly colored fruits are a key feature for attracting seed dispersers. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fruiting display."
