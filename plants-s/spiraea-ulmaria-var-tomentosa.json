    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. tomentosa, commonly known as white shrub rose, is a perennial deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and is often found in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a soft, velvety underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
