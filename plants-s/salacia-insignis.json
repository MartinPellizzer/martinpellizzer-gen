    "intro": "Salacia insignis, commonly known as the golden flame vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
