    "intro": "Styrax pilosus, commonly known as the hairy styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, red, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Styrax pilosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and showy blooms."
