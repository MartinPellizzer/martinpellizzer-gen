    "intro": "Smilax javensis var. polyantha, commonly known as the white smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
