    "intro": "Smilax aequatorialis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian arrowroot, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and emits a strong, unpleasant odor. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its edible rhizomes, though it is more often found in wild habitats."
