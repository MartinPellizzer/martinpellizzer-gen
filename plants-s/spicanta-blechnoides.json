    "intro": "Spicanta blechnoides, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on cliffs or in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic conditions. The plant has slender, upright fronds that are pinnately divided, with a dark green, leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a thin, protective layer. Spicanta blechnoides is valued for its hardy nature and ability to colonize difficult environments, making it a common sight in alpine and woodland habitats."
