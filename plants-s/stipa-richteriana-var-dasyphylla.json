It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The leaves are narrow, stiff, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, rugged appearance. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically brown or reddish in color. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species often found in rocky or sandy soils."
