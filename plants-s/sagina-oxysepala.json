    "intro": "Sagina oxysepala, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves allow it to store water, making it well adapted to dry, rocky environments. Sagina oxysepala is often found in sunny, well-drained soils and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal."
