    "intro": "Saussurea scabra, commonly known as the rough saffron, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name. Saussurea scabra is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
