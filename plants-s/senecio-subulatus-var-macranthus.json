It features dense, silver-gray foliage with needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
