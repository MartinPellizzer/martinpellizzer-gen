It is characterized by its unique tuber morphology, which includes a more elongated shape and a distinct coloration pattern. This variety is native to South America, specifically the Andean region, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and exhibits typical solanum features such as alternate leaves and solanaceous flowers. Its genetic diversity makes it an important subject for agricultural research and crop improvement programs."
