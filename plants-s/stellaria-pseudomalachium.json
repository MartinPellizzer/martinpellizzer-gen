    "intro": "Stellaria pseudomalachium, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive silver-tinged foliage due to the presence of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Stellaria pseudomalachium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
