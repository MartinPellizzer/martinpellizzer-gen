    "intro": "Selaginella nana, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. Selaginella nana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
