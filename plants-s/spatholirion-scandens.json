    "intro": "Spatholirion scandens, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its green stems for photosynthesis, while its roots penetrate the host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Spatholirion scandens is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
