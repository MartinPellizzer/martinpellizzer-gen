It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a striking white or pale blue throat. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
