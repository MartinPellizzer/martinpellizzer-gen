    "intro": "Selaginella siamensis, commonly known as the Siam spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of upright, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of moss-like tissue. Selaginella siamensis reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions. This species is also notable for its potential medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
