    "intro": "Scorbion spinosum, commonly known as the spiny scorbion, is a member of the Cactaceae family, characterized by its succulent, spiny stems. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, ribbed stems that store water for survival in dry conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the base of the spines. The spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration."
