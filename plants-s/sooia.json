    "intro": "Sooia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nelumbonaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. The soolia is not only a botanical wonder but also holds significant cultural and spiritual importance in many Asian traditions."
