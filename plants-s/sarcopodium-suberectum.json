    "intro": "Sarcopodium suberectum, commonly known as the upright sarcopodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in drier conditions. Sarcopodium suberectum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of woodlands."
