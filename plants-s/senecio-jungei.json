    "intro": "Senecio jungei, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio jungei is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
