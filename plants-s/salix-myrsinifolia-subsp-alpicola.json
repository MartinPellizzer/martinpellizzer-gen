    "intro": "Salix myrsinifolia subsp. alpicola, commonly known as alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
