    "intro": "Sideranthus spinulosus var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the glabrous ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture. This variety is notable for its reduced pubescence compared to other varieties of Sideranthus, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
