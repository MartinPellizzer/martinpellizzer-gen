It belongs to the Styracaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, aromatic cones. Its resin, similar to frankincense, has been used in traditional medicine and incense-making for centuries."
