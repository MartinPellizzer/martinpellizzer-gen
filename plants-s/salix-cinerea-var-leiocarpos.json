    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. leiocarpos, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and smooth, grayish-brown bark. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other riparian habitats. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers arranged on separate stalks. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, less hairy bark compared to other willow species."
