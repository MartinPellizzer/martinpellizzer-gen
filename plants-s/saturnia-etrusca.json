    "intro": "Saturnia etrusca, commonly known as the Etruscan moon moth, is a striking species of moth native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Saturniidae, which includes large, often colorful moths. The plant associated with this species is the common privet, though the moth itself is not a plant. Saturnia etrusca is known for its distinctive, elongated wings that resemble the shape of a moon, hence its common name. This species plays an important role in the ecosystem as both a pollinator and a food source for various predators."
