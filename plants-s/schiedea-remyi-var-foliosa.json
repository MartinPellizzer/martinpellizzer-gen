    "intro": "Schiedea remyi var. foliosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian foliate schiedea, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and is adapted to the unique climatic conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
