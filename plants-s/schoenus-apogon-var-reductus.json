It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often in marshy or swampy environments. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
