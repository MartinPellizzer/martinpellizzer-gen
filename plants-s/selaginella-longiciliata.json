    "intro": "Selaginella longiciliata, commonly known as the thread moss or slender stichopus, is a species of spore-producing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, thread-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It possesses a unique ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Selaginella longiciliata plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms."
