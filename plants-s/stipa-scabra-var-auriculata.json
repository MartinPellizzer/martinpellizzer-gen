    "intro": "Stipa scabra var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
