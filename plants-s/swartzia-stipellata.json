    "intro": "Swartzia stipellata, commonly known as the white-wood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and smooth, grayish bark. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flattened seeds. Swartzia stipellata is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making, and it also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals."
