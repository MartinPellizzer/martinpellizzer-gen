    "intro": "Stichorkis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in the cool, moist conditions of the mountain's upper elevations. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several fleshy leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It is adapted to the unique microclimate of its habitat, which includes high humidity and nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
