    "intro": "Sclarea dumetorum, commonly known as hemlock or poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds such as cicutoxin and \u03b3-conicein, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested. It often grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in fields. Due to its toxicity, it is important to identify it correctly to avoid accidental consumption."
