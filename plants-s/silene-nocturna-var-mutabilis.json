    "intro": "Silene nocturna var. mutabilis, commonly known as the night-flying catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pink to purple flowers that open in the evening and close by dawn, a trait linked to its pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The species is noted for its short blooming period and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
