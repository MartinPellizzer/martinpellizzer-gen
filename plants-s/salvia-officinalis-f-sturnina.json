    "intro": "Salvia officinalis f. sturnina, commonly known as lemon sage, is a compact, aromatic perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a distinct lemony fragrance, which is more pronounced than that of the common sage. The plant produces small, two-lipped purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. This cultivar is prized for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in herbal teas and flavoring."
