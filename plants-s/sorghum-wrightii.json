    "intro": "Sorghum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. The plant features tall, upright stalks that can reach up to 6 feet in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. Sorghum wrightii plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
