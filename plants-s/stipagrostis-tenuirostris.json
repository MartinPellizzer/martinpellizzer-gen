    "intro": "Stipagrostis tenuirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. It produces small, pale green or brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
