    "intro": "Salix rockii f. biglandulosa, commonly known as the biglandular willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, glandular hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
