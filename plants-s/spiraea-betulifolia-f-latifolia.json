    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and clusters of white to pink flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, where it is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The variety f. latifolia is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Spiraea betulifolia."
