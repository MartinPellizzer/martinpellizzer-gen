    "intro": "Stipa gracilis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
