    "intro": "Sacciolepis wombaliensis, commonly known as the Wombali sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with woolly, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
