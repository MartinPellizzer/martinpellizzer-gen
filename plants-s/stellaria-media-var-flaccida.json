    "intro": "Stellaria media var. flaccida, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways. This variant is known for its delicate, sprawling growth habit and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
