    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. javorkae, commonly known as the Bohemian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and distinctive bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with finely toothed margins, and turn yellow in autumn. This variety is often found in forest edges and rocky areas, showing adaptability to various soil types."
