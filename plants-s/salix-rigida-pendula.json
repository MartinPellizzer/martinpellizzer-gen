    "intro": "Salix rigida pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes."
