    "intro": "Syzygium lehuntii, commonly known as the Lihutu apple or Lihutu persimmon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when mature, with a sweet, edible pulp. Syzygium lehuntii is often found in lowland and montane rainforest habitats, growing as an understory shrub or small tree. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
