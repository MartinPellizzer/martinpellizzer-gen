    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides var. australis, commonly known as the Australian moss saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Australia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, moss-like coating. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on damp forest floors. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a distinctive species within the Saxifragaceae family."
