    "intro": "Struthanthus mapirensis, commonly known as the Mapire nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a short, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
