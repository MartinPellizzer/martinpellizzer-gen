    "intro": "Sedum ulricae, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing succulent that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine and arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fleshy, water-storing leaves help it survive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to harsh climates. Sedum ulricae is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
