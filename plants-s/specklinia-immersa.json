    "intro": "Specklinia immersa, commonly known as the immersed speckled fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a speckled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Specklinia immersa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
