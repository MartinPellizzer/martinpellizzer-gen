    "intro": "Spiraea pjassetzkii, commonly known as the alpine spiraea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 meters and has slender, woody stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, often turning reddish in the fall. Spiraea pjassetzkii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
