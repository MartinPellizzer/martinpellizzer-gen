    "intro": "Salicornia depressa, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that often appear glassy or translucent, especially when dried. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is commonly found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils. Salicornia depressa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
