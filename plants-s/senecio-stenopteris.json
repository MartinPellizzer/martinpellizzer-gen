    "intro": "Senecio stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
