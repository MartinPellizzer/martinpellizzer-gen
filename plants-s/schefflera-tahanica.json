    "intro": "Schefflera tahanica, commonly known as the Tahanica umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Schefflera tahanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
