    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea subsp. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow, sun-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This subspecies is distinguished by its lack of stiff hairs on the stem and leaves, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other goldenrod species. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates."
