    "intro": "Scirpus geniculatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, three-ranked spikes of greenish to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus geniculatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
