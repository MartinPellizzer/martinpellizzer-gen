    "intro": "Sideroxylon elegans, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Sideroxylon elegans is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savannas and rocky areas."
