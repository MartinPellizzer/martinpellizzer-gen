    "intro": "Selago ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty selago, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored coating, which gives it its common name. Selago ferruginea is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
