    "intro": "Spiraeopsis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spiraeopsis, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy leaves and stems give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact size and delicate blooms. Spiraeopsis pubescens prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
