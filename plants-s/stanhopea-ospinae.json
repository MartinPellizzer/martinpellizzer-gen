    "intro": "Stanhopea ospinae, commonly known as the Ospina's stanhopea, is a rare orchid species native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of yellow and purple hues. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Stanhopea ospinae is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
