    "intro": "Saxifraga malyi, commonly known as the Malyi's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh, arid conditions. Saxifraga malyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a specimen plant in alpine collections."
