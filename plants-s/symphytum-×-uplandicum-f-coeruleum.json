    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 uplandicum f. coeruleum, commonly known as the blue-flowered comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped basal leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is known for its mucilaginous roots, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and robust growth habit."
