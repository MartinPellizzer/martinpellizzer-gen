    "intro": "Salix laxiflora, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typically yellow-green and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Salix laxiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing desert landscapes."
