    "intro": "Salix bertholletii, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence. Salix bertholletii is well adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
