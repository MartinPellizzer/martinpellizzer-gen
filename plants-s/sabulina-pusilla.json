    "intro": "Sabulina pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has tiny, clustered leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures. Sabulina pusilla plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
