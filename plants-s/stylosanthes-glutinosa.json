It is characterized by its erect or semi-erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in forage production and soil conservation. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it valuable in agricultural systems."
