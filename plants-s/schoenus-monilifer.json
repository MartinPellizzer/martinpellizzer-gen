    "intro": "Schoenus monilifer, commonly known as the bearded grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, silky hairs on its inflorescence, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Schoenus monilifer plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
