    "intro": "Sterigmostemum fuhaiense, commonly known as the Fuhai star vine, is a rare flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a climbing shrub, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth surface. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, are clustered in small inflorescences and bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
