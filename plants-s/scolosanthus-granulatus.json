    "intro": "Scolosanthus granulatus, commonly known as the granular scolosanthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is covered in a fine, granular texture, giving it a unique appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
