    "intro": "[WRONG START] Styrophyllum orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's sea holly, is a rare marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and exposure to saltwater. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, allowing it to propagate in its saline environment. Stylophyllum orcuttii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to marine conditions."
