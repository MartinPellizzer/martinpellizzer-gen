    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata subsp. moschata, commonly known as the musk saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are small, white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is noted for its aromatic scent, particularly in its flowers, and is often found in moist, calcareous habitats."
