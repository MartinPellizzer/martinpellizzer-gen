    "intro": "Scandicium, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate blooms that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clusters near the base. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Scandicium is considered a vulnerable species."
