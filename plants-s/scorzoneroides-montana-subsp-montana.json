    "intro": "Scorzoneroides montana subsp. montana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas."
