    "intro": "Sedum calcaratum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum calcaratum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
