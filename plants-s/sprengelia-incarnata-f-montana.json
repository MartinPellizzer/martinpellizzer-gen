    "intro": "Sprengelia incarnata f. montana, commonly known as the Alpine Sprengelia, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range from pink to red in color. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
