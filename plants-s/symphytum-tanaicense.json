    "intro": "Symphytum tanaicense, commonly known as the Tana Island comfrey, is a perennial herb native to the island of Tana in the South China Sea. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its healing qualities."
