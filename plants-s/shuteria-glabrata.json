The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
