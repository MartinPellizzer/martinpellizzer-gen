    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 domesticum, commonly known as the common houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the growing season. Native to rocky and mountainous regions of Europe, it is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
