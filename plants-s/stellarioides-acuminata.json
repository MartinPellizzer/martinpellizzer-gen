It typically features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that have a pointed tip, giving it its species name \"acuminata.\" The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Stellarioides acuminata is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
