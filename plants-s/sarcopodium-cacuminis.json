    "intro": "Sarcopodium cacuminis, commonly known as the red spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, horizontal rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing several leaves. The plant produces showy, red-brown flowers with a distinctive, hairy appearance, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
