    "intro": "Schiedea amplexicaulis, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree cotton, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its unique, woolly appearance due to dense white hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded environments on the island of Maui. Its flowers are small and pinkish-white, blooming in clusters, and it plays an important role in the local ecosystem. Schiedea amplexicaulis is also considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in Hawaii."
