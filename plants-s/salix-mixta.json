    "intro": "Salix mixta, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix mixta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
