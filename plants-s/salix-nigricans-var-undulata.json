    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically grows near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it adaptable to various wetland environments. The wavy black willow plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
