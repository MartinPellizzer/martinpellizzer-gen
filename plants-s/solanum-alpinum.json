    "intro": "Solanum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, blooming in the summer months. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Solanum alpinum is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments."
