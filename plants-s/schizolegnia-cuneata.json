    "intro": "Schizolegnia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved legume, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and potential for use in reforestation efforts."
