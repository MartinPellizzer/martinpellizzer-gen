    "intro": "Sempervivum legrandii, commonly known as the French mountain houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Sempervivum legrandii is also noted for its ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions."
