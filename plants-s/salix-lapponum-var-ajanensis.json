    "intro": "Salix lapponum var. ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanen willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic organisms. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it a resilient species in extreme environments."
