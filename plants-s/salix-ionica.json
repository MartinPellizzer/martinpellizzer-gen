    "intro": "Salix ionica, commonly known as the Ionian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows along coastal areas and in moist, sandy soils, showcasing its adaptability to saline environments. The plant features slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by the wind. Salix ionica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
