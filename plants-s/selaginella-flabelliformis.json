    "intro": "Selaginella flabelliformis, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of spiky, evergreen fern that exhibits remarkable desiccation tolerance. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. The plant's leaves are typically small, scale-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. When dry, it appears to be dead, but it can revive when exposed to moisture, hence its common name. This adaptation allows it to survive extreme drought conditions, making it a fascinating example of plant resilience."
