    "intro": "Salix nasarovii subsp. sichotensis, commonly known as the Sichotang willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
