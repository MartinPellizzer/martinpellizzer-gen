    "intro": "Stellaria decumbens var. arenarioides, commonly known as sandstarweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed, dry habitats."
