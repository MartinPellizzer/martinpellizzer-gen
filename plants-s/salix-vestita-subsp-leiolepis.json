    "intro": "Salix vestita subsp. leiolepis, commonly known as the silky willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silky, grayish-white pubescence on the stems and leaves. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a soft, downy texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
