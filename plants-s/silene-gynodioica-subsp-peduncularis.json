    "intro": "Silene gynodioica subsp. peduncularis, commonly known as the peduncled sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has a unique reproductive system, as it is gynodioecious, meaning it has both female and hermaphroditic plants within the same population. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and genetic diversity."
