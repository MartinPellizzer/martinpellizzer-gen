    "intro": "Sapium squarrosum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, papery texture and yellowish-white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing orange seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it an invasive species in many regions. The plant has been used traditionally in Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
