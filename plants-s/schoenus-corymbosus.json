    "intro": "Schoenus corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in compact, spike-like inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. Schoenus corymbosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
