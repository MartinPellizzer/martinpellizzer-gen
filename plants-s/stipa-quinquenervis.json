    "intro": "Stipa quinquenervis, commonly known as the five-veined grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with distinct five veins running along their length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
