    "intro": "Sorghum coriaceum, commonly known as bristly sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, bristly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, dense panicles of flowers, which are typically greenish or purplish in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it an important forage crop in semi-arid regions. Its fibrous stalks are also used in traditional crafts and as a source of biofuel."
