    "intro": "Serapias parviflora var. columnae, commonly known as the columned sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the rockcress family, Brassicaceae, and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations."
