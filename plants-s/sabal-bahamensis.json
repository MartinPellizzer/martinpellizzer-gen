It is a medium-sized tree that typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 meters. The plant has a slender, unbranched trunk and produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by yellow-orange fruits. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that are stiff and pointed. Sabal bahamensis is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils near the shore."
