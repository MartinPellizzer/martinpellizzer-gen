It features slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has pinnately divided leaves with a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
