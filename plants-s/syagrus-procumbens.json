    "intro": "Syagrus procumbens, commonly known as the areca palm, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northeastern Brazil. It is a small, low-growing palm that typically reaches a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant features a short trunk with a crown of arching, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and wildlife. Syagrus procumbens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
