    "intro": "Sideroxylon, commonly known as ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to Africa, Madagascar, and parts of Asia, and they are characterized by their hard, dense wood. Many species of Sideroxylon are shrubs or small trees that can thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are usually alternate and may be simple or lobed, while the flowers are small and clustered. The genus is valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically for tools, construction, and traditional crafts."
