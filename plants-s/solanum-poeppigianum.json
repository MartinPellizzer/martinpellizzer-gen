    "intro": "Solanum poeppigianum, commonly known as the purple potato or wild potato, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots that resemble potatoes. The plant produces violet or purple flowers and has hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. The tubers are edible but contain solanine, making them potentially toxic if not prepared properly."
