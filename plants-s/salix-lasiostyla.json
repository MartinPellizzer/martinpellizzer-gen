It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green catkins. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, hairy texture on both sides. It thrives in moist, often saline soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
