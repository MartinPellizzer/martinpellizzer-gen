    "intro": "Sabulina capillacea, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its leaves are typically hairless and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Sabulina capillacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an indicator species for cold climates."
