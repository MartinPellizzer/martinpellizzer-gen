    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its slender, weeping branches and delicate, elongated leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction and are a key feature in its ecological role. Its rapid growth rate and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates. However, it is susceptible to certain diseases and pests, requiring careful management in cultivation."
