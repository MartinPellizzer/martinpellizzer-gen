It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its leaves are usually blue-gray or green, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.
