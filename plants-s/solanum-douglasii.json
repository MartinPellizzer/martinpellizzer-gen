    "intro": "Solanum douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid ingestion of any part of the plant."
