    "intro": "Sinapis alba var. melanosperma, commonly known as black mustard, is a variant of the white mustard plant characterized by its dark, glabrous seeds. It is an annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into long, slender pods containing the seeds. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, valued for their pungent flavor and potential health benefits. The dark coloration of the seeds in this variety is a distinguishing trait compared to the lighter seeds of the typical white mustard."
