    "intro": "Sobralia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are usually leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its arid mountain habitat. Sobralia scopulorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
