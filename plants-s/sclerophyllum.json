    "intro": "Sclerophyllum, commonly known as a hard-leaved plant, is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. These leaves are typically found in plants growing in dry, Mediterranean climates. The term \"sclerophyllum\" originates from the Greek words \"skleros\" meaning hard and \"phyllon\" meaning leaf. This adaptation allows the plant to thrive in environments with limited rainfall and high temperatures. Sclerophyllum is a key feature of many shrubs and trees in regions with seasonal droughts."
