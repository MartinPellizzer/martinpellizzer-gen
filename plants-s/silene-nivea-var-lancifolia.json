It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, hence the variety name *lancifolia*, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It is often found in moist soils and is known for its delicate, showy blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
