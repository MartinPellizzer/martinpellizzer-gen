    "intro": "Scirpus atrocinctus f. brachypodus, commonly known as the short-stemmed tussock sedge, is a variant of the tussock sedge species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and other moist soils, thriving in nutrient-poor conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are often greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
