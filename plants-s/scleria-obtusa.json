It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Scleria obtusa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along riverbanks. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
