    "intro": "Spergularia rupestris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal habitats in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a small, herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, and its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy. It is adapted to harsh environments and can tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions. Spergularia rupestris is often found in coastal dunes, cliffs, and other rocky areas where other plants struggle to grow."
