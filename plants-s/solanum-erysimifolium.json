    "intro": "Solanum erysimifolium, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges and hairy texture. The fruit is a small, yellow berry that contains toxic compounds, making it unsuitable for human consumption. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
