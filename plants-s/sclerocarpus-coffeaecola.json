It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a compact, shrub-like structure with aromatic, compound leaves that have a distinctive coffee-like scent. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in umbels, and the fruit is a dry, three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded parts upon maturity. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
