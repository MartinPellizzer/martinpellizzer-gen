    "intro": "Scabiosa acuminata, commonly known as the spiked ladies' tresses, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that mature into fluffy, white tufts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Scabiosa acuminata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
