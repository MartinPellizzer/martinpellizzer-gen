    "intro": "Schiedeella hyemalis, commonly known as the winter schiedea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, woolly, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Schiedeella hyemalis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
