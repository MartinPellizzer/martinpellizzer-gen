    "intro": "Salvia polystachia subsp. compacta, commonly known as the compact sage, is a perennial herb native to southern China. It features dense, compact growth with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and grayish-green in color. The plant produces showy, purple or violet flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
