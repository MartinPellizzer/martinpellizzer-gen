It features upright, branched stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
