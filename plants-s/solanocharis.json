    "intro": "Solanocharis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species belonging to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, translucent white petals that appear to glow in the shade, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic compounds, making it unsuitable for human consumption. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Solanocharis is considered an endangered species."
