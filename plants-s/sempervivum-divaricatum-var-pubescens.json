    "intro": "Sempervivum divaricatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Alps and surrounding regions. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically green to bluish-green, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. This hardy species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
