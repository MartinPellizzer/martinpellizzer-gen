    "intro": "Sarothra borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky soils in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact growth habit adapted to the harsh climate. Sarothra borealis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for Arctic ecosystems."
