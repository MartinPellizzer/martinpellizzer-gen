It is characterized by its cascading branches that hang gracefully, creating a weeping appearance. The plant produces fragrant, clustered purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. Its leaves are dark green and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice in gardens."
