    "intro": "Symplocos gittinsii, commonly known as the Gittins' wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically elliptical, leathery, and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Symplocos gittinsii is often found in moist, acidic soils in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
