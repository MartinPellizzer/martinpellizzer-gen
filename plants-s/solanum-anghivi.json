It is native to regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its small, violet to black berries are its most distinctive feature, containing toxic compounds such as solanine.
