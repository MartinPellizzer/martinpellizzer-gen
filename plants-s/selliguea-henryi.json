    "intro": "Selliguea henryi, commonly known as the Henry's rockcap, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its thalloid body, which is typically flat and leafy, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or decaying wood in temperate regions. Selliguea henryi is notable for its small, closely spaced gemmae, which are reproductive structures used for vegetative propagation. Its presence is an indicator of stable, humid microhabitats in forest ecosystems."
