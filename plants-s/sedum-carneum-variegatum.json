It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often adorned with striking variegation patterns of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in temperate climates."
