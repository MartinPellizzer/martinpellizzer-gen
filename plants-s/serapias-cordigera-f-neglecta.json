    "intro": "Serapias cordigera f. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected heart's-ear, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and vivid yellow-orange flowers with a prominent central stripe. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
