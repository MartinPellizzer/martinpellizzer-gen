    "intro": "Schizostegeopsis pachysora, commonly known as the thick-leaved schizostegeopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
