    "intro": "Suessenguthia wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's suessenguthia, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, attracting various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
