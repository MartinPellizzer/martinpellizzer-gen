    "intro": "Sorbus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, persistent berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
