    "intro": "Solanum subarmatum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a yellow or orange berry that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. Solanum subarmatum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
