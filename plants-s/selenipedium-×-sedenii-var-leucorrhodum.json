    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 sedenii var. leucorrhodum, commonly known as the white-flowered selenipedium, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees, and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces a strong, spicy aroma when in bloom. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses."
