    "intro": "Scirpus palustris var. mamillatus, commonly known as the hairy marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive hairy nodes along their length, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
