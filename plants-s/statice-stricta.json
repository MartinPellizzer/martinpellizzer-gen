    "intro": "Statice stricta, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its narrow leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Statice stricta is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
