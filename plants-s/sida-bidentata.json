    "intro": "Sida bidentata, commonly known as sand sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and the plant is well adapted to drought conditions. Sida bidentata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
