    "intro": "Salvia hamata, commonly known as the blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are hairy to the touch, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia hamata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
