    "intro": "Smilax amblyobasis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Smilax amblyobasis has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense thickets."
