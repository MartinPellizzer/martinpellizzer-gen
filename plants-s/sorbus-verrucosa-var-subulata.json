    "intro": "Sorbus verrucosa var. subulata, commonly known as the smooth-juniper or subulate rowan, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
