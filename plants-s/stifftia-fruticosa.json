    "intro": "Stifftia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Stifftia fruticosa is a resilient plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
