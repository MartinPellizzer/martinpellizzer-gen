It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal inundation, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
