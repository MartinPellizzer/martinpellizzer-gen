    "intro": "Salix glaucops, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and can become fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Salix glaucops is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
