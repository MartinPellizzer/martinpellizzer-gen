    "intro": "Sorindeia claessensii var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain sorindeia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
