    "intro": "Specklinia berolinensis, commonly known as the Berlin fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Specklinia berolinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care in indoor settings."
