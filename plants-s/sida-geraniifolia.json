    "intro": "Sida geraniifolia, commonly known as the common ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species with alternate, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of geraniums. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from summer to fall. Its fibrous roots and hairy stems are characteristic of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Sida geraniifolia is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
