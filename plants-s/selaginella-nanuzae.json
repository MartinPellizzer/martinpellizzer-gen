    "intro": "Selaginella nanuzae, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern ally native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella nanuzae is known for its ability to reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
