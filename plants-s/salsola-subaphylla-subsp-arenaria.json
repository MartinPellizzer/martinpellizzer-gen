    "intro": "Salsola subaphylla subsp. arenaria, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like structure composed of small, fleshy, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, green or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with extensive root systems that help it retain moisture. Salsola subaphylla subsp. arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert ecosystems."
