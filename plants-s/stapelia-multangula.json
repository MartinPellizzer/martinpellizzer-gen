    "intro": "Stapelia multangula, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a distinct, waxy appearance. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months. Stapelia multangula is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
