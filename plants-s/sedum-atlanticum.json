    "intro": "Sedum atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic sedum, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of North America. It is a succulent species with fleshy, often blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid or salty environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and drought makes it an important plant in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
