It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy.

This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in humid climates and its historical significance in botanical studies."
