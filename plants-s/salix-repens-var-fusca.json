    "intro": "Salix repens var. fusca, commonly known as the black willow or black sand willow, is a variant of the creeping willow that is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dark, almost black stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near riverbanks or in wet meadows. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing riverbanks through its extensive root system."
