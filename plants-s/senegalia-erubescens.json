    "intro": "Senegalia erubescens, commonly known as the red thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Senegalia erubescens is often used for forage, soil stabilization, and traditional medicine in its native habitats."
