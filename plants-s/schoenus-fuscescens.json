    "intro": "Schoenus fuscescens, commonly known as the black rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green to blackish stems that form compact clumps. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within the foliage, making it less conspicuous. Schoenus fuscescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
