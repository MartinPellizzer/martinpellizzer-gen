It possesses succulent leaves that store water and reduce water loss, typical of arid and coastal habitats. The plant has a woody stem with extensive branching, contributing to its shrub-like appearance. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
