    "intro": "Salix caprea var. coaetanea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common willow. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
