    "intro": "Schizocapsa, commonly known as the \"spiny leaf orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique leaf structure, which is divided into segments, giving them their scientific name \"Schizocapsa,\" derived from the Greek words \"schizo\" meaning split and \"kapto\" meaning to cover. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Schizocapsa species produce small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and they are known for their ornamental value in horticulture. The genus includes several species, each with distinct leaf and flower morphology adapted to their specific ecological niches."
