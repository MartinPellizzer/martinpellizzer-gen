    "intro": "Staehelina alpina, commonly known as the Alpine starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Staehelina alpina is adapted to harsh mountain environments, with a short growing season and a reliance on specific microclimates for survival."
