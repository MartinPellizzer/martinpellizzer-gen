    "intro": "Solanum cano-cinereum, commonly known as the white-hairy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, pale green stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
