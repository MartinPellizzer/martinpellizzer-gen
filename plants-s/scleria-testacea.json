It features a robust rhizomatous root system and produces dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Scleria testacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
