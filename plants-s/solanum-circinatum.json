    "intro": "Solanum circinatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces toxic berries that are yellow when mature, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
