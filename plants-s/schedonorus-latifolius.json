    "intro": "Schedonorus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures."
