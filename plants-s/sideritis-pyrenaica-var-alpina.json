    "intro": "Sideritis pyrenaica var. alpina, commonly known as alpine rock sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
