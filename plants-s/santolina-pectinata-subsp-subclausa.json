    "intro": "Santolina pectinata subsp. subclausa, commonly known as the narrowleaf santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
