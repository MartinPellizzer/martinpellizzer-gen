It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
