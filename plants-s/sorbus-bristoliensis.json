    "intro": "Sorbus bristoliensis, commonly known as the Bristoli's rowan, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the UK. It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
