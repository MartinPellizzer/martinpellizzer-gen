    "intro": "Serjania caracasana f. puberula, commonly known as the hairy serjania, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs, which is a distinguishing feature of this form. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive bilateral symmetry, and are borne in clusters. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments with well-drained soil."
