    "intro": "Salvia schizocalyx, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in velvety, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive conical shape, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
