    "intro": "Stachys angustifolia subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often branch near the base, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers in shades of violet or blue, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Its foliage and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
