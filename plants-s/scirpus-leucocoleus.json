    "intro": "Scirpus leucocoleus, commonly known as white bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces fluffy, white inflorescences that are highly visible and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its rhizomes are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Scirpus leucocoleus thrives in shallow water and mudflats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
