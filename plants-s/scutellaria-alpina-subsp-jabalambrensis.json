    "intro": "Scutellaria alpina subsp. jabalambrensis, commonly known as the Alpine skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Pyrenees and southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems and small, bilaterally symmetric flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
