    "intro": "Schomburgkia wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of northern South America, particularly in regions of Venezuela and Colombia. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered with a smooth, dark green, leathery bark. Its foliage consists of large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the trunk. Schomburgkia wendlandii produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is often found growing in shaded, moist environments."
