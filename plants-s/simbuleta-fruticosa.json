    "intro": "Simbuleta fruticosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of vibrant, often yellow or orange, flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are rich in nutrients and have a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Simbuleta fruticosa is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
