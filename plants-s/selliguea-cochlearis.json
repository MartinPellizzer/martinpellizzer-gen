It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, leaf-like body that is often lobed or segmented. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are prominently displayed on the thallus. Selliguea cochlearis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
