    "intro": "Schellolepis amoena, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, brownish fruits. Schellolepis amoena is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as forest edges and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
