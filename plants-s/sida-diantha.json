    "intro": "Sida diantha, commonly known as silverleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from summer to fall. Sida diantha is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
