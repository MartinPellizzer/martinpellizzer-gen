    "intro": "Sempervivum marmoreum var. blandum, commonly known as the Blush Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically bluish-green with a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive, stone-like appearance. The leaves are fleshy and adapted to retain moisture, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
