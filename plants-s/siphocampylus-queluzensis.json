    "intro": "Siphocampylus queluzensis, commonly known as the QueLuzean bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Portugal. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, open habitats. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Siphocampylus queluzensis is considered critically endangered."
