It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and are borne on slender stems. Saxifraga ajugoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, woodland conditions."
