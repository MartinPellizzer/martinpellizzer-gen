    "intro": "Scorzonera drarii, commonly known as the Drarii scorzonera, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, succulent stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Scorzonera drarii has small, elongated leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces a capsule-like fruit containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
