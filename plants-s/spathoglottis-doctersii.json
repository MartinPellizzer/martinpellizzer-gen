    "intro": "Spathoglottis doctersii, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, white to pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
