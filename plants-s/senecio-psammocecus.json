    "intro": "Senecio psammocecus, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Senecio psammocecus is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance."
