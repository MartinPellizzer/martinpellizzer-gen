    "intro": "Solanum leonii, commonly known as the Leonii nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by round, yellow or orange berries. Solanum leonii contains alkaloids and is toxic to humans and animals, making it a plant of caution. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
