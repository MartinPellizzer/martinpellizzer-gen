    "intro": "Stipa subulata, commonly known as the needle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa subulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
