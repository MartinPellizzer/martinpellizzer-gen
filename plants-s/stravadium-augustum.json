    "intro": "Stravadium augustum, commonly known as the golden dusk orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with a waxy texture and its clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the late afternoon. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
