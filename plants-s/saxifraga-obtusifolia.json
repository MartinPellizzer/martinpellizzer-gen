    "intro": "Saxifraga obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in crevices or on slopes where other plants struggle to survive. The plant features rosettes of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences at the end of the stems. Saxifraga obtusifolia is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
