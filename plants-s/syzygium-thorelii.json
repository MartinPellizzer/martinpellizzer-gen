    "intro": "Syzygium thorelii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and unique scent. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the tree can grow up to 30 meters tall in suitable conditions. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
