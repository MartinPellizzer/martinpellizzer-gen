    "intro": "Selliguea conjuncta, commonly known as the jointed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a central axis that is often divided into segments, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, oval, and closely appressed to the stem, with a smooth or slightly rough surface. Selliguea conjuncta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
