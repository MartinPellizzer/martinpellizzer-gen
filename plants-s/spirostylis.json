    "intro": "Spirostylis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent flowers. The spirostylis species typically have a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks, and prefer warm, humid environments. Their flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated primarily by insects."
