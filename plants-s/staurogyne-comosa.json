    "intro": "Staurogyne comosa, commonly known as the hairy waterweed, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across water surfaces. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Staurogyne comosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
