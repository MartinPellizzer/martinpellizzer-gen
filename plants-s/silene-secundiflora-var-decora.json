    "intro": "Silene secundiflora var. decora, commonly known as the showy evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, pale yellow to orange-yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and other nocturnal insects. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
