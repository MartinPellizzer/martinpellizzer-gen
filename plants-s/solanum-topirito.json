    "intro": "Solanum topirito, commonly known as the Topirito nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
