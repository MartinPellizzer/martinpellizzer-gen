    "intro": "Sphaereupatorium sphaerocephalum, commonly known as the globe-headed cypress, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its spherical crown and dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature in the second year, and its leaves are short, thick, and arranged in crossed pairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
