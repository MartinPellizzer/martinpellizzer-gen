It is characterized by its segmented, flattened stems that form a branching structure, and its vibrant flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a houseplant due to its long blooming period and ability to thrive indoors. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a favored ornamental plant."
