    "intro": "Sida lepida, commonly known as the silky sida, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Sida lepida is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
