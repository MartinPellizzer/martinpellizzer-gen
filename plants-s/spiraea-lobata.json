    "intro": "Spiraea lobata, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Spiraea lobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for wildlife."
