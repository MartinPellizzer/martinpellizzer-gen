    "intro": "Stipa curviseta, commonly known as the bent-stem grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Stipa curviseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
