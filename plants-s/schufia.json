    "intro": "Schufia, commonly known as the blue flax or skyflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers. Schufia species are herbaceous perennials that often grow in rocky or coastal environments. The plants have hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and they produce showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Schufia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
