    "intro": "Saxifraga ladanifera, commonly known as the sweet saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga ladanifera thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
