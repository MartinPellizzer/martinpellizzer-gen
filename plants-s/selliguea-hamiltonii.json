    "intro": "Selliguea hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's rockcap, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a thallus that is usually flat and lobed, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its lobes. Selliguea hamiltonii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
