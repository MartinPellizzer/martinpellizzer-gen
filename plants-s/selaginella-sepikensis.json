    "intro": "Selaginella sepikensis, commonly known as the Sepik spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae, characterized by its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing tissues. Selaginella sepikensis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms. Its reproductive structures, which include microspores and megaspores, are essential for its propagation and survival in its native habitat."
