    "intro": "Sulcorebutia breviflora var. haseltonii, commonly known as the Haselton's moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a swollen, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Its leaves are typically short and fleshy, arranged in a rosette pattern. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
