    "intro": "Saxifraga planifolia var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically a deep green with a purplish tinge, especially under stress or in cooler conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
