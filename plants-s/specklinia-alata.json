    "intro": "Specklinia alata, commonly known as the veined pigmy orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish hue at the base. Specklinia alata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
