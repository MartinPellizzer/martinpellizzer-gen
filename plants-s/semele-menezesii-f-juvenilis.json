    "intro": "Semele menezesii f. juvenilis, commonly known as the juvenile semele, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and striking, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, such as woodlands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
