    "intro": "Sideroxylon belizense, commonly known as the Belize ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are dark green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
