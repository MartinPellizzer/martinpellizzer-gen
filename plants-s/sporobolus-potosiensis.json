    "intro": "Sporobolus potosiensis, commonly known as the Potosi grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly resilient in harsh environments. Sporobolus potosiensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
