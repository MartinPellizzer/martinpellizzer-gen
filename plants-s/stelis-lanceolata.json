    "intro": "Stelis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolated orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, typically white or pale pink, arranged in racemes. Its leaves are linear and lance-shaped, which is reflected in its scientific name. Stelis lanceolata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
