It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spadix-like flowers at the top of the stem, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, playing a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
