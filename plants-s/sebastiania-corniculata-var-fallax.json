    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variant of the red maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red or orange-red leaves, which turn vibrant hues in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking seasonal color."
