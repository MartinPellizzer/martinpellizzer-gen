    "intro": "Stellaria viscida, commonly known as sticky starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered with glandular dots that secrete a sticky substance. Stellaria viscida thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
