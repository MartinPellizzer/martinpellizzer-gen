    "intro": "Sedum hispanicum var. semiglabrum, commonly known as the Spanish stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
