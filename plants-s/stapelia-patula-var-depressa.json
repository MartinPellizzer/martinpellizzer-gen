    "intro": "Stapelia patula var. depressa, commonly known as the \"Limpopo lantern\" or \"bottle plant,\" is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a tendency to form dense clumps when grown in suitable conditions. Stapelia patula var. depressa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
