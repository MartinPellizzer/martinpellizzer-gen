It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, often blooming in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species."
