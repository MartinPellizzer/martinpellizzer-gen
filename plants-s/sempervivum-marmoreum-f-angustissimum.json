    "intro": "Sempervivum marmoreum f. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing succulent plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features tightly packed rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a powdery coating. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral, giving the plant a compact and attractive appearance. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soil conditions."
