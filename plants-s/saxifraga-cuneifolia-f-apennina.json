    "intro": "Saxifraga cuneifolia f. apennina, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of elliptic, cuneate, and often hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for alpine and subalpine landscapes."
