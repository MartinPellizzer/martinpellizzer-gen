    "intro": "Selago tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fuzzy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or coastal environments. Selago tomentosa is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
