    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea subsp. turfosa, commonly known as the Turf Goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are covered in a distinctive whitish bloom. The Turf Goldenrod is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
