    "intro": "Styphelia forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. Styphelia forbesii is also known for its ability to survive in harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
