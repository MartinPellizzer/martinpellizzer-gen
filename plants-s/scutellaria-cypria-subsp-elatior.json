    "intro": "Scutellaria cypria subsp. elatior, commonly known as the Greater Cyprian skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in herbal remedies, though its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological niche."
