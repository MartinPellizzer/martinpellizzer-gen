    "intro": "Samaropyxis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and consists of several species, including Samaropyxis capensis and Samaropyxis tamarindoides. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnately compound, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Samaropyxis species are often found in woodland and coastal habitats, and they play a role in local ecosystems as a source of food for certain insects and animals."
