    "intro": "Swartzia longipedicellata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is often found in moist lowland forests. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the tree can grow up to 30 meters tall. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
