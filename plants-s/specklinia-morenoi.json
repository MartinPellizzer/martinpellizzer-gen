    "intro": "Specklinia morenoi, commonly known as the Moreno's pigmy orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
