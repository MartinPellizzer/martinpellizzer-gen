It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its distinctive perforations in the leaf blades make it easily identifiable among similar species."
