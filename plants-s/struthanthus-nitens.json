    "intro": "Struthanthus nitens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Struthanthus nitens is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
