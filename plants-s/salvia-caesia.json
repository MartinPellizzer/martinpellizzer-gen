    "intro": "Salvia caesia, commonly known as blue sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Salvia caesia is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional herbal practices."
