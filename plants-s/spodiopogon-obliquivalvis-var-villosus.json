    "intro": "Spodiopogon obliquivalvis var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet that bears small, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in disturbed or transitional wetlands. This variant is distinguished by its hairy texture and ecological adaptability, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
