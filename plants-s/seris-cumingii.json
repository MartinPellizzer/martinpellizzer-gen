    "intro": "Seris cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's seris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seris cumingii is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
