    "intro": "Saussurea malitiosa, commonly known as the Himalayan corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often hairy and upright. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
