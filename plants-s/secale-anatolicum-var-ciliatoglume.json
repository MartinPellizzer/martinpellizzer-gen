    "intro": "Secale anatolicum var. ciliatoglume, commonly known as the Anatolian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Anatolian region of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
