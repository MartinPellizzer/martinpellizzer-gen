    "intro": "Sagina apetala f. obtusisepala, commonly known as the obtuse-lobed sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky or sandy soils in temperate regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
