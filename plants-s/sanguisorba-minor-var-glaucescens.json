It features upright, slender stems that are often tinged with a bluish hue, especially when mature. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, with a somewhat succulent texture. Sanguisorba minor var. glaucescens is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
