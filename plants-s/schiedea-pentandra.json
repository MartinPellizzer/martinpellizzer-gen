    "intro": "Schiedea pentandra, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a tall, branching stem that bears yellow flower heads, which bloom in the spring. Schiedea pentandra is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano. It is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species."
