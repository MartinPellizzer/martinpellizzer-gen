    "intro": "Solanum commersonii var. violaceum, commonly known as the purple-flowered nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces smooth, oval berries that turn from green to yellowish when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
