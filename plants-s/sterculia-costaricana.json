It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
