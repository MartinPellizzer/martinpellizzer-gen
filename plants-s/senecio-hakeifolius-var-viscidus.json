    "intro": "Senecio hakeifolius var. viscidus, commonly known as sticky hakealeaf, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
