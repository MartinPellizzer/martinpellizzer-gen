    "intro": "Sarcolobus subnudus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Australian region. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Sarcolobus subnudus plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by supporting bird populations and influencing forest regeneration."
