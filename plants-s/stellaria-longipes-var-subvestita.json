    "intro": "Stellaria longipes var. subvestita, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, white or pale purple flowers in clusters. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or damp meadows. The plant is often noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
