    "intro": "Sempervivum penninum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. Sempervivum penninum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
