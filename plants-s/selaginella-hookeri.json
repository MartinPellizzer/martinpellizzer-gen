    "intro": "Selaginella hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features upright, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophyte produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are arranged in cone-like formations. Selaginella hookeri is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
