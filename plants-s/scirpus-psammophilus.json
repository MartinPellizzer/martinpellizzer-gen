    "intro": "Scirpus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand reed, is a perennial grass-like plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in well-drained, saline soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy in coastal habitats. Scirpus psammophilus plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it a key component of coastal ecosystems."
