    "intro": "Simmondsia chinensis, commonly known as jojoba, is a shrub native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its yellow-green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a wax ester-rich liquid in its seeds, which is chemically distinct from true oils. This unique substance is widely used in cosmetics, skincare, and as a lubricant due to its stability and moisturizing properties. Jojoba is also valued for its resilience to arid conditions, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems."
