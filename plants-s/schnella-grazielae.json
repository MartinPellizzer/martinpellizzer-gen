    "intro": "Schnella grazielae, commonly known as the Graham's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its ghostly white petals and sepals, which resemble a spectral figure, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schnella grazielae is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
