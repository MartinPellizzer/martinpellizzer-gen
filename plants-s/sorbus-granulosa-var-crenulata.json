    "intro": "Sorbus granulosa var. crenulata, commonly known as the roughleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, textured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique appearance and hardy nature."
