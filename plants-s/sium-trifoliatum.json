    "intro": "Sium trifoliatum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three-lobed and resemble those of the common parsnip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
