    "intro": "Sorghum dochna var. wightii, commonly known as the Wight's sorghum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
