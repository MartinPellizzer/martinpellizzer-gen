    "intro": "Stipa plumigera, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a soft, silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa plumigera is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
