    "intro": "Steganthera cyclopensis, commonly known as the cyclopentadecyl plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves with a distinctive five-lobed structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
