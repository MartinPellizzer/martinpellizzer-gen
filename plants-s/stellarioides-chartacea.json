    "intro": "Stellarioides chartacea, commonly known as the paperleaf stellaria, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features thin, papery leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
