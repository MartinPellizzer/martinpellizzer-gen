    "intro": "Sondera thysanosepala, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
