    "intro": "Sporobolus tenuis, commonly known as slender sanddrop, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Sporobolus tenuis is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed sites where it plays a role in preventing erosion."
