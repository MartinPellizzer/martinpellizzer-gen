    "intro": "Scirpus pinguiculus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers that mature into brown, fluffy seeds. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Scirpus pinguiculus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
