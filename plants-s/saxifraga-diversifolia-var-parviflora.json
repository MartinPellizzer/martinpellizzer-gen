It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and resilient addition to alpine gardens."
