    "intro": "Symphyotrichum oolentangiense var. poaceum, commonly known as the grassy white coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that give it its common name, and it often grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many familiar flowering plants. The varietal form, poaceum, is distinguished by its more grass-like foliage compared to the typical form of the species."
