    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. suprastrigulosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, usually green or yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for agricultural or ornamental use."
