    "intro": "Senecio liabifolius, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is an important species in its native habitat."
