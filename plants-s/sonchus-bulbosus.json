    "intro": "Sonchus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a single, sparsely hairy stem that bears yellow flowers in a composite head. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
