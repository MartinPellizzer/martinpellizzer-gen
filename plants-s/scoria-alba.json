    "intro": "Scoria alba, commonly known as white scoria, is a type of volcanic rock characterized by its light color and porous texture. It forms from the cooling of lava and contains numerous gas bubbles that give it a distinctive appearance. This rock is often found in volcanic regions and is composed primarily of silicate minerals. Scoria alba is lightweight and has low density, making it useful in various industrial applications. Its botanical relevance is more geological than botanical, as it is not a plant but a mineral-based material."
