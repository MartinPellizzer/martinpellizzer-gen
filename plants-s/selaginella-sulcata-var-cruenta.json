    "intro": "Selaginella sulcata var. cruenta, commonly known as the curled spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and distinctive, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are typically found at the tips of the stems, and it produces both microspores and megaspores. This resilient plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to survive in low-water conditions."
