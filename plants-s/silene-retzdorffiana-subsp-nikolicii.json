It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
