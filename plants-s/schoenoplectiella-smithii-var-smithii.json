    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella smithii var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental potential in water garden settings."
