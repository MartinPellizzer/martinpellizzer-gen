    "intro": "Senecillis virgaurea, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Senecillis virgaurea is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
