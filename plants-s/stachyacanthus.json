It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble a crown. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Stachyacanthus species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
