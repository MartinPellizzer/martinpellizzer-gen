It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that often have a bluish-gray underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry conditions. Senna glaucifolia is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
