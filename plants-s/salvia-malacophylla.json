    "intro": "Salvia malacophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia malacophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
