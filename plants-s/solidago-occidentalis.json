    "intro": "Solidago occidentalis, commonly known as western goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Solidago occidentalis plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
