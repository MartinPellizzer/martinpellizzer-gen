    "intro": "Senecio pauperculus var. neoscoticus, commonly known as the Neoscotic groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. This variant is distinguished by its compact form and unique floral characteristics compared to other Senecio species."
