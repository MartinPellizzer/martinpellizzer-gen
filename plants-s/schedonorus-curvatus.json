    "intro": "Schedonorus curvatus, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps suppress weeds. Schedonorus curvatus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand foot traffic."
