    "intro": "Solanum sinaicum, commonly known as the Sinai nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, similar to other members of the Solanaceae family. Solanum sinaicum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability."
