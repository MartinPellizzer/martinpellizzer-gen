    "intro": "Senecio gibbosus, commonly known as the knobstem groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a short, thick stem with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Senecio gibbosus is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
