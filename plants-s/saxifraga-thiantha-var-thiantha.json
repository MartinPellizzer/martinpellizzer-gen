    "intro": "Saxifraga thiantha var. thiantha, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cold climates due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
