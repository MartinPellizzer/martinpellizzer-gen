It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blooms that often appear before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
