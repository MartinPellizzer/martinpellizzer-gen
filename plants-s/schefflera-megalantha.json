    "intro": "Schefflera megalantha, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. Schefflera megalantha is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
