It features fleshy, gray-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, flattened shape, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in dry climates."
