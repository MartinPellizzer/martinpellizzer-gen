    "intro": "Strombocactus pseudomacrochele, commonly known as the giant desert rose, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height, and it produces vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains, and its stems store water to survive prolonged droughts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert environments."
