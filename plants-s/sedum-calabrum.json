    "intro": "Sedum calabrum, commonly known as the Sicilian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum calabrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid environments."
