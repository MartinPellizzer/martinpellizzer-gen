It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces in temperate regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, elongated leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Selliguea whitfordii is often found in rocky habitats and is an indicator species for certain environmental conditions."
