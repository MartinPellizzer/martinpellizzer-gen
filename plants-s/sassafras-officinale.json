    "intro": "Sassafras officinale, commonly known as sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elliptical, red or orange berries. Its roots and bark contain compounds like safrole, which have been historically used in various herbal remedies. However, due to the potential toxicity of safrole, the plant is now primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes."
