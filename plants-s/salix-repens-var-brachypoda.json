    "intro": "Salix repens var. brachypoda, commonly known as the creeping willow or short-stemmed willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, often boggy habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, typical of willow species."
