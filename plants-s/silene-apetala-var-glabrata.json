    "intro": "Silene apetala var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-flowered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are usually unbranched and slightly hairy. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous petals, which set it apart from other varieties of Silene apetala."
