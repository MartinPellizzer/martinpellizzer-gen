    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hebecarpa, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that drape like curtains, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping."
