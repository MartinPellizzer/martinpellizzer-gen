    "intro": "Schefflera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, umbrella-like crown composed of multiple leaf clusters, each with a single, thick, waxy leaf. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy, dark green surface. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are attractive to birds. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
