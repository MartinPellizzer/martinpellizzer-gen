    "intro": "Saponaria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which can create a soapy lather when mixed with water. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine, sticky hairs. Saponaria glutinosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
