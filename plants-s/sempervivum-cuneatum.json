    "intro": "Sempervivum cuneatum, commonly known as the pointed houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Sempervivum cuneatum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
