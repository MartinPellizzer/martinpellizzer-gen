    "intro": "Strophanthus divaricatus, commonly known as the African milk-vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it both a valuable medicinal plant and a potential hazard."
