It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and showy, orange-red flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, fluffy seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.
