    "intro": "Senecio aspleniifolius, commonly known as the fernleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, featuring slender stems and a rosette of dark green, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its foliage is characterized by its finely divided, aspleniifolius-like leaves, which give it its common name."
