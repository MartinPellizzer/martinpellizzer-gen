    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reflect excess light. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Sudamerlycaste longiscapa is considered a vulnerable species."
