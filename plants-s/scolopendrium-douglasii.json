    "intro": "Scolopendrium douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically clustered in small, compact structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Scolopendrium douglasii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
