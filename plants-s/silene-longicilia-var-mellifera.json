    "intro": "Silene longicilia var. mellifera, commonly known as the honey-flower catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
