    "intro": "Stipa tiraquensis, commonly known as the Tiraqu\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Stipa tiraquensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appearance."
