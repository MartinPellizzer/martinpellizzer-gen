    "intro": "Scolymocephalus elongatus, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in sandy or rocky coastal areas. Scolymocephalus elongatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
