    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus ritro, commonly known as the globular moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, with small, rounded leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions on rocks or soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from specialized leaves called calyptrae. Sphaerocephalus ritro plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
