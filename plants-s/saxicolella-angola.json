    "intro": "Saxicolella angola, commonly known as the Angola saxicolella, is a member of the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Saxicolella angola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
