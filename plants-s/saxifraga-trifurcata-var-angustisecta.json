    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata var. angustisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stonecrop, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or alpine conditions."
