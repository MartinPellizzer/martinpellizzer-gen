    "intro": "Schistachne, commonly known as false grass or panic grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in wet or disturbed soils. Schistachne species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Many species produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. They play a role in stabilizing soil and are sometimes used in horticulture or as indicators of environmental conditions."
