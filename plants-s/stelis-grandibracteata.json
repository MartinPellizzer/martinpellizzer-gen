    "intro": "Stelis grandibracteata, commonly known as the giant bract stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that often bloom in clusters. The plant produces thick, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air and surrounding environment. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. Stelis grandibracteata is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
