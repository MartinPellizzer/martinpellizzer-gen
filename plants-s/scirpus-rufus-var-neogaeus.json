    "intro": "Scirpus rufus var. neogaeus, commonly known as the red sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
