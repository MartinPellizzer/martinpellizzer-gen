It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and unique morphological features."
