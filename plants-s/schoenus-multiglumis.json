    "intro": "Schoenus multiglumis, commonly known as the many-barbed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Schoenus multiglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
