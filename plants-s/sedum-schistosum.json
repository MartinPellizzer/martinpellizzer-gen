    "intro": "Sedum schistosum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in poor soil conditions."
