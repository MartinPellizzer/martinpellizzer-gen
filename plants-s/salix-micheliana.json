    "intro": "Salix micheliana, commonly known as the Michel's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in spring. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
