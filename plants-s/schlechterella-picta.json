It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow to orange thallus with intricate, often branched patterns. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary photosynthetic function. Schlechterella picta typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in shaded, humid environments. Its unique coloration and morphology make it a notable species in lichenology and ecological studies."
