    "intro": "Syngonium castroi, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that vary in color from bright green to deep maroon, depending on the variety. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and prefers indirect sunlight. Its stems are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by blue-black berries. Syngonium castroi is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
