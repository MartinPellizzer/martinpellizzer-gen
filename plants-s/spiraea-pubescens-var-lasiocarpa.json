    "intro": "Spiraea pubescens var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the downy spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
