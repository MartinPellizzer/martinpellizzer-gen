    "intro": "Stipa pennata f. asperior, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive, stiff, and bristly foliage. It is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and often covered with fine, rough hairs, contributing to its common name. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
