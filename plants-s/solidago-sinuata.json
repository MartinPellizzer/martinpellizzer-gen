    "intro": "Solidago sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and streambanks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a wavy margin. Solidago sinuata plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
