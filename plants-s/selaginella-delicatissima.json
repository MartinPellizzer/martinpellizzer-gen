    "intro": "Selaginella delicatissima, commonly known as the delicate spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a low-growing, creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under certain light conditions. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released into the air for dispersal. Selaginella delicatissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
