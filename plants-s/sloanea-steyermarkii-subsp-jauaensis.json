    "intro": "Sloanea steyermarkii subsp. jauaensis, commonly known as the Jauaense Sloanea, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in cloud forests and humid lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
