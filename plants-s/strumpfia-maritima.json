    "intro": "Strumpfia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray flowers and silver-green, fuzzy leaves. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing in dunes or on rocky shores. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh maritime environments. Strumpfia maritima is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
