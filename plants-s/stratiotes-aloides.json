    "intro": "Stratiotes aloides, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It has broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late spring to early summer. Stratiotes aloides is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its structure and growth habits make it an important part of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
