    "intro": "Stelis binotii, commonly known as the two-banded orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Stelis binotii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
