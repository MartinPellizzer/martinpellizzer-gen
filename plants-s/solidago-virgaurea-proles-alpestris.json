It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh mountain environment. It plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
