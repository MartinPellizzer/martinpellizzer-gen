    "intro": "Silaus rubtzovii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Russia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Silaus rubtzovii is often found in alpine and subarctic environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
