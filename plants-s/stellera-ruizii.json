    "intro": "Stellera ruizii, commonly known as the Ruiz's starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface, and its flowers are small, white, and star-shaped, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Stellera ruizii has fibrous roots and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
