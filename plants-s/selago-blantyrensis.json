    "intro": "Selago blantyrensis, commonly known as the Blantyren sandveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, pale green to golden flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture. Selago blantyrensis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
