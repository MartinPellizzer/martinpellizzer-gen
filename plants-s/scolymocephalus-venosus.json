    "intro": "Scolymocephalus venosus, commonly known as the veined scolymus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely veined leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wet meadows. Its unique vascular patterns and delicate appearance make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
