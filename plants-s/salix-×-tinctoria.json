    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 tinctoria, commonly known as the dyer's willow, is a hybrid willow species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional dyeing processes. The plant produces small, yellow catkins that are wind-pollinated, and it typically grows in moist, temperate environments. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that yield various dyes, including yellow and green hues. Salix \u00d7 tinctoria is valued both for its ecological role and its historical significance in textile dyeing."
