    "intro": "Schefflera nebularum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
