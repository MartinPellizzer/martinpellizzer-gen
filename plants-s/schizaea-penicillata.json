It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with erect, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Schizaea penicillata is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptability, making it a notable species in its native habitats."
