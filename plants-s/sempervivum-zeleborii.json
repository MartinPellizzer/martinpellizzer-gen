    "intro": "Sempervivum zeleborii, commonly known as the Zelborian houseleek, is a species of succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
