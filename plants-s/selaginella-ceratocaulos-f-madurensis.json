    "intro": "Selaginella ceratocaulos f. madurensis, commonly known as the Madurensis spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, spiky leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in dense spirals around the stems. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with a short, stout stem and a cluster of small, scale-like leaves at the apex. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
