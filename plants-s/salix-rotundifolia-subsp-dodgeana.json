    "intro": "Salix rotundifolia subsp. dodgeana, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its rounded, often hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in wet, boggy environments. The plant typically produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its flexible stems and compact growth habit make it well-suited for erosion control in moist soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and specific leaf morphology compared to other willow species."
