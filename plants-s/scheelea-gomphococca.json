    "intro": "Scheelea gomphococca, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a rough, sometimes fuzzy texture. Scheelea gomphococca is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
