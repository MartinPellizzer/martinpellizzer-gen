    "intro": "Stelis ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its roots are often tuberous, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Stelis ekmanii is a rare and specialized species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
