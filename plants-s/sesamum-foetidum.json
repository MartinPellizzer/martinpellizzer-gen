    "intro": "Sesamum foetidum, commonly known as stinking sesame, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and aromatic, sesame-like seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has alternate, narrow leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil, though the plant is often considered invasive in some areas. The plant's strong, unpleasant odor is a notable feature, contributing to its common name."
