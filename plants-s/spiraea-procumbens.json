    "intro": "Spiraea procumbens, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Spiraea procumbens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
