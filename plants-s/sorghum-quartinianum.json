    "intro": "Sorghum quartinianum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of less than one meter, making it well-suited for cultivation in limited spaces. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. This species is valued for its resilience to drought and its potential use in forage and grain production."
