    "intro": "Synurus humilis, commonly known as the low-growing synurus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent and drought-tolerant species. The plant typically has fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are small and often clustered, with colors ranging from yellow to pink, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Synurus humilis is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun with minimal water."
