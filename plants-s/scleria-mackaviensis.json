It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, cylindrical leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early to mid-summer. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like structure with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family. Scleria mackaviensis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
