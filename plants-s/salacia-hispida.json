    "intro": "Salacia hispida, commonly known as the rough salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, while the leaves are ovate with serrated edges. Salacia hispida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
