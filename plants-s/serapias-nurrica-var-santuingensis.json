    "intro": "Serapias nurrica var. santuingensis, commonly known as the Santuiring orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring brightly colored, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
