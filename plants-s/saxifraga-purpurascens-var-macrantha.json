    "intro": "Saxifraga purpurascens var. macrantha, commonly known as the purple saxifrage with large flowers, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves that help protect it from harsh cold. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens in cooler climates."
