    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua f. latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are characterized by broad, ovate bracts that are often mistaken for petals, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens."
