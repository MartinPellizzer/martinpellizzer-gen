    "intro": "Silene scabriflora subsp. scabriflora, commonly known as the roughleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the ends of the stems. Silene scabriflora subsp. scabriflora is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats."
