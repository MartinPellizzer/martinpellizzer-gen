    "intro": "Salix reticulata var. normalis, commonly known as the common weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that hang in cascading streams of leaves. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist soils, making it a common sight near waterways and wetlands."
