    "intro": "Salisburia ginkgo, commonly known as the maidenhair tree, is a unique species with ancient origins, dating back to the Mesozoic era. It is characterized by its fan-shaped leaves that are deeply divided and have a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female trees, and it produces seeds enclosed in a fleshy, odorous outer layer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance. The tree is also notable for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
