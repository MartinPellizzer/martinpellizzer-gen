    "intro": "Sagina breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
