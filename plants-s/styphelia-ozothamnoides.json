    "intro": "Styphelia ozothamnoides, commonly known as the Ozothamnoides heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white to greyish hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Styphelia ozothamnoides is often found in open, sunny habitats and is a common component of heathland ecosystems."
