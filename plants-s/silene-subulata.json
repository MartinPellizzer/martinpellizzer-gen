    "intro": "Silene subulata, commonly known as the slender catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, delicate, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and pointed. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments. Silene subulata is characterized by its ability to survive in harsh climates due to its compact growth form and frost-resistant properties. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
