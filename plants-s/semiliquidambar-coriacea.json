    "intro": "Semiliquidambar coriacea, commonly known as the roughshank maple, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its wood is dense and hard, making it valuable for furniture and tool-making. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
