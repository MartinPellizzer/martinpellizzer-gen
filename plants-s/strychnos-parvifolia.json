    "intro": "Strychnos parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved strychnos, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are small and often covered in a sticky substance. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically used in traditional medicine but is of interest in botanical studies."
