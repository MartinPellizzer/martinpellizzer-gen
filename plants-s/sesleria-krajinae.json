    "intro": "Sesleria krajinae, commonly known as the Krajina's sedge, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in woodland or heathland environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads during the late spring and summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
