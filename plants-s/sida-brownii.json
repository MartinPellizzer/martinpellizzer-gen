    "intro": "Sida brownii, commonly known as the brown sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open fields, along roadsides, and in sandy areas. Its small, pink to purple flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sida brownii is also known for its fibrous stems, which have been used historically for textile purposes."
