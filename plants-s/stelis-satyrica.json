    "intro": "Stelis satyrica, commonly known as the satyric stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light. Stelis satyrica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
