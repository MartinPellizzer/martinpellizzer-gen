It is a low-growing herb with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain heat in its cold environment. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats. Silene boraeana plays a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and flies."
