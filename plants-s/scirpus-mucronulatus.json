    "intro": "Scirpus mucronulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus mucronulatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species."
