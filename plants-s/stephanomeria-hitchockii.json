    "intro": "Stephanomeria hitchockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ecological importance and unique appearance, it is often found in conservation efforts aimed at preserving native flora."
