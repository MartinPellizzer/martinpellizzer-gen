    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. dregei, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features small, scale-like leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is often considered a vulnerable species."
