It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are often red when mature. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique flowering behavior and potential medicinal properties."
