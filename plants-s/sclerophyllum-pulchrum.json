    "intro": "Sclerophyllum pulchrum, commonly known as the beautiful hard-leaved plant, is a shrub characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically evergreen, with a dense, leathery texture that reduces water loss. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a resilient and ornamental species in horticulture."
