    "intro": "Senegalia rurrenabaqueana, commonly known as the Rurrenabaque acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually bipinnate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. It has adapted to arid environments with its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. This species is valued for its ecological role and has limited use in traditional medicine."
