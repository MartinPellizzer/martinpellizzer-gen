    "intro": "Sophora benthamii, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pendulous flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its fragrant blooms and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
