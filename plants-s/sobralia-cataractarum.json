    "intro": "Sobralia cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall sobralia, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous bright yellow or orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to capture rainwater. Sobralia cataractarum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
