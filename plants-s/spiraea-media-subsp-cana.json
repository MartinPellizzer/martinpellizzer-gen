It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that cascade with clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive silvery-white underside that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils.
