    "intro": "Sporobolus tricholepis, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in sandy or gravelly soils. It has slender, erect stems that produce small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and the ability to spread via both seeds and rhizomes. It is drought-tolerant and often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Sporobolus tricholepis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
