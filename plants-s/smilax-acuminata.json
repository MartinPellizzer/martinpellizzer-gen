    "intro": "Smilax acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed catbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Smilax acuminata is often found in wooded areas, along fences, and in disturbed soils, where it can form dense thickets."
