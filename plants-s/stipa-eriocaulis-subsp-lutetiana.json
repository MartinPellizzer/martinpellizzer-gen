    "intro": "Stipa eriocaulis subsp. lutetiana, commonly known as the Lutetian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often slightly hairy. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
