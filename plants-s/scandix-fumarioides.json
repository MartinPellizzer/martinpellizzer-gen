    "intro": "Scandix fumarioides, commonly known as the climbing goth orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces striking, fumarioid-like flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred shape. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in loose soil, while its stems are slender and vine-like, allowing it to climb. Scandix fumarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
