    "intro": "Salix niphoclada var. fullertonensis, commonly known as the Fullerton's willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are usually gray-green in color and may turn reddish in the fall. This species is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
