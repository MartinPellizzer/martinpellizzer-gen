    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the white willow, is a shrub native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow or reddish in color. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
