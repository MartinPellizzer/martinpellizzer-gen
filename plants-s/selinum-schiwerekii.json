    "intro": "Selinum schiwerekii, commonly known as the Schiwerek's garlic chives, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
