    "intro": "Stenandrium droseroides, commonly known as the sticky leaf orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, hairy, and sticky leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often appearing in spring. Its specialized adaptations for nutrient uptake through insect trapping make it an interesting subject in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
