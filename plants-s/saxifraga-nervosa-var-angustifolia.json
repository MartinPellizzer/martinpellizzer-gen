    "intro": "Saxifraga nervosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved rock sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and serrated, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
