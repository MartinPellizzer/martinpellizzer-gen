    "intro": "Senecio ochoanus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils of desert and semi-desert regions. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Senecio ochoanus is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts."
