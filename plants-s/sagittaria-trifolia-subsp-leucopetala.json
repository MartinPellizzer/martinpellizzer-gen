    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia subsp. leucopetala, commonly known as white arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically light green to white in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
