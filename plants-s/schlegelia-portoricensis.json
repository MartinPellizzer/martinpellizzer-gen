It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
