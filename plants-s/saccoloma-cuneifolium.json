    "intro": "Saccoloma cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saccoloma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Saccoloma cuneifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
