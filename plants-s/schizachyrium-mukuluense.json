    "intro": "Schizachyrium mukuluense, commonly known as the Mukulu grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Schizachyrium mukuluense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional practices in its native region."
