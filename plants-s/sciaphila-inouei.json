    "intro": "Sciaphila inouei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Sciaphila inouei thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
