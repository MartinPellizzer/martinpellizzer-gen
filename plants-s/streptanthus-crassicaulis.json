    "intro": "Streptanthus crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed rocket. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
