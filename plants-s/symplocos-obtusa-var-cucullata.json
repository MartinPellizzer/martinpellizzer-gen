    "intro": "Symplocos obtusa var. cucullata, commonly known as the broad-leafed inkberry, is a variant of the inkberry plant native to parts of East Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense thickets. This variety is valued for its adaptability and resilience in shaded environments."
