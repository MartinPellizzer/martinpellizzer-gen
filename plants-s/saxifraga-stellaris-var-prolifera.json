    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. prolifera, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of white woolly hair. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is noted for its ability to produce numerous offsets, contributing to its spread and abundance in suitable habitats."
