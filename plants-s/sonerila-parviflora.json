It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental value. Sonerila parviflora is often cultivated in shaded gardens due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils and partial sunlight."
