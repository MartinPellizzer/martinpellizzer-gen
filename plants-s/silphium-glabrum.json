    "intro": "Silphium glabrum, commonly known as the western compass plant, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with alternating leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from July to September. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its historical significance and declining populations, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
