It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. Sidalcea interrupta is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
