    "intro": "Salix oleifolia, commonly known as the fragrant willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it is known for its fragrant, sticky resinous sap. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix oleifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
