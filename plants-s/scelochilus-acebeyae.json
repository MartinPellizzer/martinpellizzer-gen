It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat destruction, Scelochilus acebeyae is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
