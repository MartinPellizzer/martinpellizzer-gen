    "intro": "Stenophalium almasense, commonly known as the Almasense Stenophalium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and purple. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
