    "intro": "Sicyocaulis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray florets that resemble holly leaves, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. Sicyocaulis species are perennial herbs with a rosette of basal leaves and tall, branching stems. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
