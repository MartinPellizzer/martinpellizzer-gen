    "intro": "Specklinia calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest areas. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically fragrant. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Specklinia calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
