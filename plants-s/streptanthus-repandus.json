It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds. Streptanthus repandus is an important species for ecological studies due to its specialized adaptations to arid environments."
