    "intro": "Senna scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. Senna scabriuscula is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and its ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
