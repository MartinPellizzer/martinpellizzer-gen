    "intro": "Solanum pannosum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spherical, green berries, which turn red when mature. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their raw form. Solanum pannosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
