    "intro": "Savia oblongifolia var. decaryi, commonly known as the Decary's narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit make it a desirable ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
