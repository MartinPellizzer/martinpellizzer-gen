    "intro": "Sonneratia acida var. griffithii, commonly known as the sour apple mangrove, is a variant of the Sonneratia acida species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its salty habitat. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a sour taste. This variant is notable for its adaptability to tidal zones and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
