    "intro": "Selaginella muricata, commonly known as the clubmoss or spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette-like structure with spirally arranged leaves, and its sporophyte stage is characterized by a short, erect stem topped with a spore-producing cone. Selaginella muricata is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various invertebrates."
