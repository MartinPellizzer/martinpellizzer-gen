    "intro": "Silene psammitis subsp. lasiostyla, commonly known as the sandsteppe campion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
