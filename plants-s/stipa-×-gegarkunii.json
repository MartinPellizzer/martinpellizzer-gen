    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 gegarkunii, commonly known as the hybrid goatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa secundiflora. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in the mountainous areas of Kazakhstan and western China. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and is primarily propagated through vegetative means."
