    "intro": "Saxifraga khiakhensis, commonly known as the Armenian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in a terminal cluster. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
