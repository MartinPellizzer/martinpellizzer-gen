    "intro": "Santalum oblongatum, commonly known as the oblong sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic, durable timber used in furniture and incense. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy soils in coastal or subtropical regions."
