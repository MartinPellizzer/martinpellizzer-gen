    "intro": "Selenipedilum chica, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, yellow pulp. Its botanical name reflects its association with the moon, as its flowers open in response to darkness. Selenipedilum chica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal beauty."
