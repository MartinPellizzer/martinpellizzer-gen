    "intro": "Stevia brevipapposa, commonly known as the short-pappous stevia, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and northern Argentina. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is valued for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used in food products. Stevia brevipapposa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental and commercial cultivation."
