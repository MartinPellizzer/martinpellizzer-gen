It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pinkish to white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often arranged in racemes. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Sida subdensiflora is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields."
