    "intro": "Struthiopteris japanensis, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and velvety in texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
