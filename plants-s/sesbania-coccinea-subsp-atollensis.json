    "intro": "Sesbania coccinea subsp. atollensis, commonly known as the red sesbania, is a flowering plant native to the Indian Ocean and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical and slightly hairy. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that turn brown as they mature, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
