    "intro": "Schoenorchis phitamii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its flowers are often clustered in a spike and have a unique, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Schoenorchis phitamii is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
