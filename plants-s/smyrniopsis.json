    "intro": "Smyrniopsis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. These shrubs or small trees are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are typically fig-like, though they are not true figs, and are often used in local cuisines. Smyrniopsis plants are adapted to rocky and arid environments, making them resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
