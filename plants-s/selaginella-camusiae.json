It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its stems. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella camusiae is a spore-bearing plant, reproducing through the release of spores rather than seeds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
