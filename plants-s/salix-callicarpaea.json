    "intro": "Salix callicarpaea, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive reddish-brown bark. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and typically have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Salix callicarpaea is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
