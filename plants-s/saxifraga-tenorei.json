    "intro": "Saxifraga tenorei, commonly known as the Etna saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
