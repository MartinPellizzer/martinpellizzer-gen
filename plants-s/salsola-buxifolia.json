    "intro": "Salsola buxifolia, commonly known as silver saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Salsola buxifolia is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is considered a hardy, drought-resistant species."
