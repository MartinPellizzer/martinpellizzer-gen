    "intro": "Senecio wittebergensis, commonly known as the Witteberg groundsel, is a South African endemic species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Senecio wittebergensis is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in local herbal remedies."
