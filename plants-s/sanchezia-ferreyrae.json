    "intro": "Sanchezia ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's staghorn plant, is a rare species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically orange or red in color, which attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sanchezia ferreyrae is considered a vulnerable species."
