    "intro": "Saurauia longipetiolata var. melegritoi, commonly known as the Melegrito's saurauia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
