    "intro": "Sticherus loheri var. major, commonly known as the giant sticherus, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a distinctive branching pattern, with multiple fiddleheads emerging from a central stem. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
