    "intro": "Scurrula lonicerifolia, commonly known as the creeping woodruff, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its creeping habit and ability to form dense mats make it a useful ground cover in certain ecological settings."
