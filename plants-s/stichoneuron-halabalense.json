    "intro": "Stichoneuron halabalense, commonly known as the Halabalan fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Stichonemataceae. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters, with a distinctive, segmented structure. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing sporangia in specialized clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
