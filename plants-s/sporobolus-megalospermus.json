    "intro": "Sporobolus megalospermus, commonly known as giant sand spurry, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and sandy environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are typically pale green to brown and are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal."
