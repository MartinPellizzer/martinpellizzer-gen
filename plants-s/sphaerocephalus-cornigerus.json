    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus cornigerus, commonly known as the knobhead lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded thallus that forms dense, crust-like growths on bark and rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a yellowish to orange-brown coloration, with a smooth or slightly granular surface. It is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on both sun-exposed and shaded substrates. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and cryptic species within its native range."
