It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Stylobasium spathulatum is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
