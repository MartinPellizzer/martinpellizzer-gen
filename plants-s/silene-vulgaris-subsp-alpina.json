    "intro": "Silene vulgaris subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe, Asia, and North America."
