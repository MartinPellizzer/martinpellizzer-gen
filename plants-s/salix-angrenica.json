    "intro": "Salix angrenica, commonly known as the Angren willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Salix angrenica is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
