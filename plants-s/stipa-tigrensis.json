    "intro": "Stipa tigrensis, commonly known as the tiger grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppe and grasslands, and is adapted to withstand drought and grazing. Stipa tigrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
