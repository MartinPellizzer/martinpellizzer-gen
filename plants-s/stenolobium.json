    "intro": "Stenolobium, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its striking, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, and its pods are elongated and woody. Stenolobium species are valued for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
