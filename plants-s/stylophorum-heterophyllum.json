    "intro": "Stylophorum heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowslip, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodlands or along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive narrow shape, and its roots are fibrous, contributing to soil stabilization. Stylophorum heterophyllum is often found in moist, acidic soils and is a common sight in the understory of deciduous forests."
