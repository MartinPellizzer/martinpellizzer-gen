    "intro": "Santalum insulare var. hendersonense, commonly known as Henderson's sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Henderson in the Pitcairn Islands. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The tree produces small, white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fragrant wood has historically been valued for its aromatic properties, though it is now critically endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species."
