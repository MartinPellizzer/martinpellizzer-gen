    "intro": "Sasa paniculata var. nebulosa, commonly known as the clouded bamboo, is a clump-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and finely textured leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form thickets in shaded, moist environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
