    "intro": "Siphanthera microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf siphonostemon, is a small shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
