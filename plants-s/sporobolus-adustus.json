    "intro": "Sporobolus adustus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its survival in harsh conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Sporobolus adustus is adapted to low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats."
