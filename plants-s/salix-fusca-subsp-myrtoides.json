It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat."
