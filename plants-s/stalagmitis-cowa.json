    "intro": "Stalagmitis cowa, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of southern Brazil. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant features elongated, slender fronds with a silvery sheen that reflects light, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones that develop at the base of the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Stalagmitis cowa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
