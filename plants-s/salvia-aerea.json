    "intro": "Salvia aerea, commonly known as the mountain sage, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in cooler climates.
