    "intro": "Sclerodactylon juncifolium, commonly known as the African milkwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it survive in dry conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. This species is often used in traditional medicine and for its durable wood."
