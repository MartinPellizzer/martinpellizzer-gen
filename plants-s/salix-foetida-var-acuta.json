    "intro": "Salix foetida var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of central and southern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed and have a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellowish-green and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The leaves and bark contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has historically been used in traditional medicine."
