    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. huairuru, commonly known as the Huairuru nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of violet flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers."
