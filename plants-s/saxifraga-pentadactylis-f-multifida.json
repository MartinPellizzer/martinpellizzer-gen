    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis f. multifida, commonly known as the multifid saxifrage, is a rare and striking alpine plant characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
