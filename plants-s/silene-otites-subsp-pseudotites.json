    "intro": "Silene otites subsp. pseudotites, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, often hairy stems and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes."
