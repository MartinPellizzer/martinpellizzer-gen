    "intro": "Silene pinetorum subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as pine barrens and forest edges. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with pine trees."
