It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with its deep root system and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, and they open in response to sunlight. Somrania is also valued for its ornamental beauty and traditional uses in local cultures."
