It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, whorled arrangement of leaf blades. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
