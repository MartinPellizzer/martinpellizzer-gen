It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to edible, round fruits resembling apples. The fruit has a white, fleshy pulp with a sweet, aromatic flavor, making it a valuable food source for both humans and wildlife. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
