    "intro": "Spiraea nipponica var. ogawae, commonly known as the Japanese weeping spirea, is a shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely cut, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its flowering display. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal interest throughout the year."
