    "intro": "Soldanella pseudomontana, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in meadows and slopes. Soldanella pseudomontana is well adapted to cold climates and is a characteristic component of alpine flora."
