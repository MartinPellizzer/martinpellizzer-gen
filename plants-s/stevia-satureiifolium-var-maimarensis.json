    "intro": "Stevia satureiifolium var. maimarensis, commonly known as Maimari stevia, is a rare and lesser-known species of the stevia genus native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typical of the sunflower family. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, making it a potential natural sweetener. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered plant species."
