    "intro": "Sium silaus, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America and parts of Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and celery, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its root is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic properties. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
