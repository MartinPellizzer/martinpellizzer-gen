    "intro": "Stachys pusilla, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2\u201310 centimeters and features tiny, opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. Stachys pusilla is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
