    "intro": "Setaria carnei, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
