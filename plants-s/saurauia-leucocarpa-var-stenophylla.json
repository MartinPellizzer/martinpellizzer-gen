    "intro": "Saurauia leucocarpa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed white-fruited saurauia, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that turn red when mature, attracting various bird species. This variant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in montane forests."
