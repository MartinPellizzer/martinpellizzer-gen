    "intro": "Sabina scopulorum, commonly known as the rock juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine. Sabina scopulorum is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries."
