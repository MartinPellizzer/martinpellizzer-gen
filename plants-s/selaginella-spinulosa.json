    "intro": "Selaginella spinulosa, commonly known as the spinous spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with elongated, spiny structures that give it its common name. Its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage, typical of bryophytes and fern allies. Selaginella spinulosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
