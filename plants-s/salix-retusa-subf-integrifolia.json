    "intro": "Salix retusa subf. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth-margined. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
