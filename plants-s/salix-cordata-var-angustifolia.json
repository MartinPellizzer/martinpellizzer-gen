    "intro": "Salix cordata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight along streambanks and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
