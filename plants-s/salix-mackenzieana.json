    "intro": "Salix mackenzieana, commonly known as Mackenzie willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a valuable pioneer species in disturbed or barren environments. Salix mackenzieana is adapted to harsh climates, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
