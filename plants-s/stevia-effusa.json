    "intro": "Stevia effusa, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it is often cultivated for its sweet-tasting leaves. Stevia effusa is valued in herbal medicine and as a sugar substitute due to its intense sweetness and low caloric content."
