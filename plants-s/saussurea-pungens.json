    "intro": "Saussurea pungens, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, pale blue or white ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic, and often pungent odor, which is thought to deter herbivores. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. Saussurea pungens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
