It is characterized by its distinctive spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall flowering stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
