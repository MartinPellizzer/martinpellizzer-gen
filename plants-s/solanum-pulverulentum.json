    "intro": "Solanum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dustflower or purple morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Solanum pulverulentum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in warm, sunny environments."
