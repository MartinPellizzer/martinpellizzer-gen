It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds. Solanum insigne belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
