    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 restituta, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, with long, slender leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular ornamental species in gardens and along waterways."
