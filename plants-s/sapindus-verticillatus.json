    "intro": "Sapindus verticillatus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 foliages arranged in a whorl. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, spiny fruits containing a single seed. The fruit's outer layer, known as the \"soapberry,\" contains a saponin that has cleansing properties. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
