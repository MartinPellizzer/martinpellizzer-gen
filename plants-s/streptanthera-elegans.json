    "intro": "Streptanthera elegans, commonly known as the elegant streptanthera, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with five petals arranged in a distinctive pattern. Streptanthera elegans is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
