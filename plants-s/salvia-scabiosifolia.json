    "intro": "Salvia scabiosifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
