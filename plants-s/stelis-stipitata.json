    "intro": "Stelis stipitata, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, stout stem with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. Stelis stipitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid conditions."
