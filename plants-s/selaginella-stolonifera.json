    "intro": "Selaginella stolonifera, commonly known as the wandering spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes and help in vegetative propagation. Its leaves are spirally arranged and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Selaginella stolonifera is also notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized cellular structures."
