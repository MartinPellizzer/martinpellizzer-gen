    "intro": "Solanum montanum var. arenarium, commonly known as the sand hill nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of star-shaped, violet to blue flowers. The plant produces small, globose berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its toxic compounds, it is often avoided by livestock and humans."
