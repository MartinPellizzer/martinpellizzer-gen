It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in arid and coastal environments, showing drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soil conditions. Due to its unique chemical composition and ecological significance, it is of interest in both botanical research and sustainable agriculture."
