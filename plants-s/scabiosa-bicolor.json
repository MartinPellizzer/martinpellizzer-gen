    "intro": "Scabiosa bicolor, commonly known as the devil's bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that typically feature a purple or pink center surrounded by white petals. The plant grows from a basal rosette of leaves and produces numerous stems that bear the showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Scabiosa bicolor is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
