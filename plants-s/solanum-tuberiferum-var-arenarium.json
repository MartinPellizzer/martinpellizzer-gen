    "intro": "Solanum tuberiferum var. arenarium, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
