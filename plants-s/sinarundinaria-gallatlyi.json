It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges."
