    "intro": "Schoenus curvifolius, commonly known as the curly-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming clumps that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spike-like clusters. Schoenus curvifolius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
