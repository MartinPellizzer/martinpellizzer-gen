    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 macrophylla, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal."
