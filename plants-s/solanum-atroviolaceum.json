    "intro": "Solanum atroviolaceum, commonly known as the dark violet nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and the fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to yellow as it matures. Solanum atroviolaceum is notable for its striking floral coloration and its role in local ecosystems."
