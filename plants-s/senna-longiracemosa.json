    "intro": "Senna longiracemosa, commonly known as the long raceme senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers arranged in long, racemose inflorescences. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Senna longiracemosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, and it also serves as a source of nectar for pollinators."
