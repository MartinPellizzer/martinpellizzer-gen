    "intro": "Streptolirion volubile subsp. volubile, commonly known as the climbing bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, climbing stems that can twine around supports, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. The leaves are opposite, simple, and lanceolate, with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbing plants. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
