    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum huilense, commonly known as the Huilense Sunlight Plant, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of western Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are adapted to capture minimal sunlight in its shaded habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are pollinated by specific insects. Its roots system is highly specialized, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum huilense is considered an endangered species."
