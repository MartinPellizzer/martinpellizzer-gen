    "intro": "Saxifraga microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
