    "intro": "Selaginella tomentosa, commonly known as the mossy spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorls of spirally arranged leaves, which are often covered in a dense, woolly coating of tiny scales. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper parts of the stems and contain spores. Selaginella tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
