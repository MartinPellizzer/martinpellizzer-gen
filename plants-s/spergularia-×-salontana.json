    "intro": "Spergularia \u00d7 salontana, commonly known as the hybrid sea sandplant, is a halophytic species that thrives in saline environments. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other areas with high salinity. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
