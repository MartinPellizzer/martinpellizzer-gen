    "intro": "Stachys cretica subsp. velata, commonly known as creeping betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its subspecies distinction is based on differences in leaf and flower morphology compared to the typical form of *Stachys cretica*. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
