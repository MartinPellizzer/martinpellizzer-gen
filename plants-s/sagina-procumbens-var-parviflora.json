    "intro": "Sagina procumbens var. parviflora, commonly known as moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often in dense clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
