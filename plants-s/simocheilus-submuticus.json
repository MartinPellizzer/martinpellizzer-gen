    "intro": "Simocheilus submuticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom from June to August. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
