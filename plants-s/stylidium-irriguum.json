    "intro": "Stylidium irriguum, commonly known as the water triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique ability to curl its leaves in response to touch, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Stylidium irriguum is an important species for ecological studies due to its adaptive features and role in local ecosystems."
