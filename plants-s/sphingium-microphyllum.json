    "intro": "Sphingium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf sphingium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in wetlands. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Sphingium microphyllum is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
