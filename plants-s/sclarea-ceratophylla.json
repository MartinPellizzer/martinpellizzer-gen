    "intro": "Sclarea ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned angelica, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a species of conservation concern."
