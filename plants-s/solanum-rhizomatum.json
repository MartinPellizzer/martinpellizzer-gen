    "intro": "Solanum rhizomatum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
