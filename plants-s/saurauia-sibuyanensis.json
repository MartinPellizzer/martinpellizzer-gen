    "intro": "Saurauia sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan lantern tree, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Sibuyan in the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescences that appear during the dry season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at high altitudes. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white flowers that emit a faint fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Saurauia sibuyanensis is considered an endangered species."
