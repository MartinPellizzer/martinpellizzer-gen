    "intro": "Scleria hirtella var. killipiana, commonly known as Killip's bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-chambered spikelets that are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its environment. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in brackish and freshwater conditions."
