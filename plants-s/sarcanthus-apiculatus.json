    "intro": "Sarcanthus apiculatus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a \"tuna,\" is a green, fleshy berry that contains numerous seeds. The plant's spiny stems and adaptations to drought make it a unique and resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
