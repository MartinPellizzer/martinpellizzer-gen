    "intro": "Swartzia oriximinaensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, round seeds. Due to overharvesting, Swartzia oriximinaensis is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
