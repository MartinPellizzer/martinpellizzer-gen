    "intro": "Stelis asperilinguis, commonly known as the warty-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, wiry stem covered with rough, warty protuberances, which give it its common name. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often clustered in a raceme."
