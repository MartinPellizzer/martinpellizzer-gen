    "intro": "Spongiocarpella, commonly known as the spongepod plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spongy, and often inflated fruit capsules that resemble small, porous pods. These plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm and humid environments. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a rough or hairy surface. Spongiocarpella species are often found in wetlands or along riverbanks, where their root systems help stabilize the soil."
