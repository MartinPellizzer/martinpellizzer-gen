    "intro": "Struthiopteris claytoniana, commonly known as the Clayton's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and covered with a layer of brown, fibrous tissue. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
