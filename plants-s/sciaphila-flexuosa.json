    "intro": "Sciaphila flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a delicate, orchid-like appearance. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Sciaphila flexuosa is considered a threatened species."
