    "intro": "Sapindus angulatus, commonly known as the angular soapnut, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for producing fruits that enclose a cluster of seeds, which are encased in a soap-like substance, making it useful for cleansing. Its growth habit includes a rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
