    "intro": "Solanum brevimucronatum, commonly known as the short-awned nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
