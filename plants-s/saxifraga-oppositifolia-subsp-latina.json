    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. latina, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
