    "intro": "Sagina filicaulis var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in grassy areas, rocky slopes, and along stream banks. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a tight rosette, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. It is a perennial species that spreads by stolons, forming dense vegetation that helps prevent soil erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in gardens."
