    "intro": "Syringodea splendens, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a prominent red or purple throat. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of these showy blooms, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Syringodea splendens is a climbing plant that can grow up to 15 meters in length, with heart-shaped leaves and a woody stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
