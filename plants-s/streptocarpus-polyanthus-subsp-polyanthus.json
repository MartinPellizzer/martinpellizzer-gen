    "intro": "Streptocarpus polyanthus subsp. polyanthus, commonly known as the African Violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically velvety and dark green. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the year under proper care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
