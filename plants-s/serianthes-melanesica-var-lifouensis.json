    "intro": "Serianthes melanesica var. lifouensis, commonly known as the Lifou ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the island of Lifou in the Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia. It is characterized by its dense, dark timber and slow growth rate, which contributes to its exceptional durability. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a straight trunk and broad, leathery leaves that are adapted to the humid tropical climate. It plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
