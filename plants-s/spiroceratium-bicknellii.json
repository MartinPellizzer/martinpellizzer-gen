    "intro": "Spiroceratium bicknellii, commonly known as the Bicknell's spiroceratium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
