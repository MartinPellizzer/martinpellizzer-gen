    "intro": "Senecio moaensis, commonly known as the Moa's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to habitat loss and introduced pests, Senecio moaensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
