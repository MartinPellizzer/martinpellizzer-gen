    "intro": "Schwenckia ulei, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Schwenckia ulei has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by insects."
