    "intro": "Strychnos gubleri, commonly known as the African angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature of its botanical structure. Strychnos gubleri is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
