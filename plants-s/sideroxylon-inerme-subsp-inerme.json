    "intro": "Sideroxylon inerme subsp. inerme, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its use in furniture and incense. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with yellowish-green petals, and the fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds."
