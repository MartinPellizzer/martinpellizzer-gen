    "intro": "Solanum pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, followed by yellow berries that contain toxic compounds. Solanum pearcei is often found in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system and drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
