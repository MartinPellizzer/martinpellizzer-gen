It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically yellow or red when mature, are toxic and should not be consumed. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
