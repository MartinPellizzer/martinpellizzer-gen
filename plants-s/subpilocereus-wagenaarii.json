    "intro": "Subpilocereus wagenaarii, commonly known as the Wagenaar's night blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features a compact, rounded stem that is ribbed and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
