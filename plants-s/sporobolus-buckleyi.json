    "intro": "Sporobolus buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in wetland and riparian habitats, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to colonize and persist in moist environments. Sporobolus buckleyi plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and waterfowl, by providing habitat and food resources."
