    "intro": "Selaginella melleri, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats or cushions on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella melleri is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
