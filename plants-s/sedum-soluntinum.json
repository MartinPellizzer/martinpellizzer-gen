    "intro": "Sedum soluntinum, commonly known as the Soluntine Stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial succulent that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to arid conditions. Sedum soluntinum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
