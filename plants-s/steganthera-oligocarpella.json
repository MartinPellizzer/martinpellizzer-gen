    "intro": "Steganthera oligocarpella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Steganthera oligocarpella is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
