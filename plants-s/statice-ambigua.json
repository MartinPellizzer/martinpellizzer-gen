    "intro": "Statice ambigua, commonly known as the common statice, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spikes of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and seaside cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice ambigua is a hardy perennial that blooms from summer to autumn, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens and floral arrangements."
