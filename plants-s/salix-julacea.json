    "intro": "Salix julacea, commonly known as the white willow or summer willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Salix julacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
