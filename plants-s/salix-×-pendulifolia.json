    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pendulifolia, commonly known as weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main stem, creating a unique, flowing appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Salix \u00d7 pendulifolia is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and along waterways due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
