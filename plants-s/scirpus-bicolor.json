    "intro": "Scirpus bicolor, commonly known as the pink rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Scirpus bicolor plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
