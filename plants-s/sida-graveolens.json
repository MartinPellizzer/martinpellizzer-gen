    "intro": "Sida graveolens, commonly known as stinkweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, pungent odor. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its fibrous roots and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Sida graveolens thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas."
