    "intro": "Scabiosa prolifera, commonly known as the clustered lovegrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures that are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, providing a textured appearance. Scabiosa prolifera is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
