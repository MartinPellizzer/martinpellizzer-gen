    "intro": "Steyerbromelia discolor, commonly known as the silver bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, silver-green, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting mix when grown in cultivation. Its unique foliage and showy inflorescence make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
