    "intro": "Selaginella simalurana, commonly known as the \"whisk fern,\" is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching structure with small, scale-like leaves that resemble a fern. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella simalurana reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it lacks true roots, instead having root-like structures called rhizoids. Its unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject in the study of ancient plant adaptations."
