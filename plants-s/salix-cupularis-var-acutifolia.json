    "intro": "Salix cupularis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or red in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
