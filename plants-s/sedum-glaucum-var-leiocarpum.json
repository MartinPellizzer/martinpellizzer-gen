It features fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and attractive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
