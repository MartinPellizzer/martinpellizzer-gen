    "intro": "Scolopendrium rhizophyllum, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively. It features a creeping rhizome from which upright fronds emerge, often giving the appearance of a cluster of individual plants. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, somewhat zigzag appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This plant is notable for its ability to regenerate from its rhizomes, making it resilient to disturbances."
