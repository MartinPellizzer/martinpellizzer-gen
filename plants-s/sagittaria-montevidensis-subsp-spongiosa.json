    "intro": "Sagittaria montevidensis subsp. spongiosa, commonly known as the spongy arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water surface. Its roots form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment in wetland environments. It is often found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams."
