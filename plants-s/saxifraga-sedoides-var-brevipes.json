It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish hue, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in crevices and on slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
