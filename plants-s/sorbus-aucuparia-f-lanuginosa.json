It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in woodland or scrub habitats. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
