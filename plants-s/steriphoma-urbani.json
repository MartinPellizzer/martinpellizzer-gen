    "intro": "Steriphoma urbani, commonly known as the urban spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include pale greenish-yellow petals and a unique floral structure that aids in its pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
