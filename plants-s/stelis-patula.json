    "intro": "Stelis patula, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in a loose cluster. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Stelis patula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
