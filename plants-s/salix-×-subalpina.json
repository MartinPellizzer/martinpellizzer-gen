    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 subalpina, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a hybrid species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, often multi-stemmed branches and lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Salix \u00d7 subalpina is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and poor soil, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems."
