    "intro": "Siphocampylus umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant's inflorescence is a dense cluster of flowers arranged in an umbel, giving it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions. Siphocampylus umbellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
