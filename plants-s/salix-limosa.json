    "intro": "Salix limosa, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils along riverbanks, wetlands, and other water-adjacent habitats. The bark of Salix limosa is typically gray to black in color and may peel in thin layers."
