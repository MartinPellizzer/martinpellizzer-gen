    "intro": "Senegalia irwinii, commonly known as the irwin's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Senegalia irwinii is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded lands."
