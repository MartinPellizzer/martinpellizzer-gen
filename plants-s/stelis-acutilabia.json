    "intro": "Stelis acutilabia, commonly known as the sharp-lipped stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike. Stelis acutilabia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
