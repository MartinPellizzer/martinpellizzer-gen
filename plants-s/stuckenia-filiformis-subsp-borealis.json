    "intro": "Stuckenia filiformis subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern filiform waterplantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are usually submerged, with small, greenish-white flowers emerging from the water surface. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its subspecific name, *borealis*, reflects its preference for cooler, northern climates."
