    "intro": "Sobralia sobralioides, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange in color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of brightly colored flowers that bloom sequentially, creating a dramatic display. The leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
