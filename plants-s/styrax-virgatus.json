    "intro": "Styrax virgatus, commonly known as the Virginia styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, waxy flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a glossy, dark green upper surface. Styrax virgatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
