    "intro": "Scheuchzeria calyculata, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Scheuchzeria calyculata plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
