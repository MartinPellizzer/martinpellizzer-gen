    "intro": "Salix monandra var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical *Salix monandra*. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
