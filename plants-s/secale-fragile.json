    "intro": "Secale fragile, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, Secale fragile is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
