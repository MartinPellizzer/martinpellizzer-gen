    "intro": "Siphoniopsis monoica, commonly known as the single-flowered siphoniopsis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescence and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
