    "intro": "Spiranthes ensifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Spiranthes ensifolia is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
