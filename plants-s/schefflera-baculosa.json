    "intro": "Schefflera baculosa, commonly known as the slender umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant indoors or outdoors. Schefflera baculosa is valued for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
