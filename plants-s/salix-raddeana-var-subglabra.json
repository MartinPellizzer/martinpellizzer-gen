    "intro": "Salix raddeana var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both surfaces. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, low-maintenance plant."
