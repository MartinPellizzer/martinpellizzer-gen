    "intro": "Sphenantha scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and moist woodlands. Its rhizomes allow it to climb and spread along tree trunks and other structures. Sphenantha scandens plays a role in providing habitat and contributing to the ecological diversity of its native ecosystems."
