    "intro": "Stipa caespitosa, commonly known as silvergrass or tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of pale green to golden yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Stipa caespitosa is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
