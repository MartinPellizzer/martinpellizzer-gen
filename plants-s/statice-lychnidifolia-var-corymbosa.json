    "intro": "Statice lychnidifolia var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered glasswort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, spike-like clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline or alkaline soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of salt marshes. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
