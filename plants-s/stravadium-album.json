    "intro": "Stravadium album, commonly known as the white snowflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its pale white petals and small, clustered flowers that bloom during the short summer months. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Stravadium album is considered a vulnerable species."
