    "intro": "Sedum listoniae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that help it store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
