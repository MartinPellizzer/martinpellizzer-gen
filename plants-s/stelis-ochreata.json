    "intro": "Stelis ochreata, commonly known as the golden stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on its host for structural support rather than soil. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually yellow or orange, arranged in a spike. Stelis ochreata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
