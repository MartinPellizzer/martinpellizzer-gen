    "intro": "Stelis tarantula, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance, with long, thin stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Stelis tarantula thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
