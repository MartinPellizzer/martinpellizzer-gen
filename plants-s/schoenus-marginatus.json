    "intro": "Schoenus marginatus, commonly known as the coastal grass or marginate flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as estuaries and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-sided spikelets that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Schoenus marginatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
