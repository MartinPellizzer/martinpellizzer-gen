    "intro": "Selaginella polyptera, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in tiny, clustered structures called strobila. Selaginella polyptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
