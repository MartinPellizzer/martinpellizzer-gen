    "intro": "Stenotyla estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan rock cactus, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, spiny structure and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
