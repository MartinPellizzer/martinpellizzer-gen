    "intro": "Selaginella henryi, commonly known as the Henry's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to China. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has creeping stems that produce upright, cone-like structures called strobila, which bear the sporangia. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Selaginella henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
