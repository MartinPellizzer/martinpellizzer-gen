    "intro": "Scleropogon brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are short and narrow, with a dark green color and a waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-parted flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Scleropogon brevifolius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
