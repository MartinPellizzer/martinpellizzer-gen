    "intro": "Swartzia rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered swartzia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is distinguished by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent yellow or red base. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Swartzia rariflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
