    "intro": "Salix matsudana, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted for its ornamental value. Salix matsudana is also valued for its role in traditional Chinese medicine."
