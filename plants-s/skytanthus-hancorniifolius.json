    "intro": "Skytanthus hancorniifolius, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and striking red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and its bark is often deeply fissured. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is also a species of concern in conservation efforts."
