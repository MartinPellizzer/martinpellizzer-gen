    "intro": "Scelochilus delcastilloi, commonly known as the Del Castillo's scelochilus, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, with strikingly intricate petal structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
