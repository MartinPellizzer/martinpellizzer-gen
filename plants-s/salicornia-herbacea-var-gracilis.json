It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of salt-excreting glands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other brackish habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
