    "intro": "Sporobolus tetragonus, commonly known as four-cornered spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it thrives in well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or arid environments. Sporobolus tetragonus is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
