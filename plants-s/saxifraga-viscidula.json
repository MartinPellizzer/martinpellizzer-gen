    "intro": "Saxifraga viscidula, commonly known as sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its succulent leaves are coated with a sticky substance, which may deter herbivores and aid in water retention. Saxifraga viscidula is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, thriving in conditions of low light and cold temperatures."
