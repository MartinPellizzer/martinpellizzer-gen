    "intro": "Solanum hierochuntinum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berries that range in color from green to red. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
