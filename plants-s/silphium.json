    "intro": "Silphium, commonly known as the \"Greek fennel,\" is a now-extinct plant native to the region of ancient Greece and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, robust stature, reaching up to six feet in height, with large, umbrella-like flower heads. The plant's rhizomes and roots were highly valued for their medicinal properties, particularly for treating digestive ailments and as a contraceptive. Silphium was so prized that it became a major trade commodity, often used as currency in ancient times. Its extinction is believed to have been caused by overharvesting and habitat loss, leading to its disappearance from the historical record."
