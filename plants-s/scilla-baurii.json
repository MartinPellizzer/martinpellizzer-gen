    "intro": "Scilla baurii, commonly known as the Persian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran and the Caucasus. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Scilla baurii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
