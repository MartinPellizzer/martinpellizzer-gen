It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
