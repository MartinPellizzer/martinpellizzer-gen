    "intro": "Schiedea stellarioides var. implexoides, commonly known as the Hawaiian star-moss, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are generally succulent and arranged in a dense rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. This variety is considered rare and is often found in rocky or coastal areas, reflecting its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii."
