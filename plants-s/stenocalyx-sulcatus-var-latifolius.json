    "intro": "Stenocalyx sulcatus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf stenocalyx, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely on the stems. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are often borne on short peduncles. This variant is distinguished by its wider foliage compared to the typical form of Stenocalyx sulcatus."
