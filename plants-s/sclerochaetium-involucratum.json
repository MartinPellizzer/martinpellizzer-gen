    "intro": "Sclerochaetium involucratum, commonly known as the woolly burr, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, spiny stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick leaves and a deep root system for water retention. Sclerochaetium involucratum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
