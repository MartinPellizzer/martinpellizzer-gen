    "intro": "Smilax microphylla var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, climbing stems with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are covered in sharp, curved spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This variety is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
