    "intro": "Syzygium nanpingense, commonly known as the Nanping guava, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to southern China, particularly in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and small, edible fruits that are similar to guavas but with a distinct flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Syzygium genus."
