    "intro": "Salvia glechomifolia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, cobweb-like foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Salvia glechomifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscape design."
