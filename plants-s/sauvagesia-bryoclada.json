It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred lip that attracts pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
