    "intro": "Scleria lithosperma var. lithosperma, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is particularly adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils."
