    "intro": "Spergula droseroides, commonly known as the dewy willow or the sticky willow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which secrete a sticky substance. These hairs are believed to aid in the capture of small insects, contributing to the plant's nutrient uptake. Spergula droseroides is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
