    "intro": "Sloanea billardierei, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and compound leaves that are pinnate with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often peeling in thin flakes, and it is adapted to grow in a range of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. Sloanea billardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
