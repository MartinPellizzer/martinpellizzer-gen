    "intro": "Stipa germanica, commonly known as German needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa germanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
