    "intro": "Siphonodon australis var. keysii, commonly known as the Keys siphonodon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
