    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos elatus subsp. thomensis, commonly known as the Tomonga orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, tropical rainforests of its native habitat. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant blooms that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
