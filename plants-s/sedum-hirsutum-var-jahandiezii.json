    "intro": "Sedum hirsutum var. jahandiezii, commonly known as the Desert Sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. Its stems are often hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
