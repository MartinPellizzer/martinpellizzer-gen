    "intro": "Salix multiglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, glandular surface. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and often grayish-brown, with a fragrant scent when crushed. Salix multiglandulosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas."
