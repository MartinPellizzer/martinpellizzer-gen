    "intro": "Serapias perez-chiscanoi var. sanvicentei, commonly known as the San Vicente orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically display a mix of yellow and orange hues. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its growth habit is terrestrial, with a short stem and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
