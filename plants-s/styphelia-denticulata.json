    "intro": "Styphelia denticulata, commonly known as the toothed snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit and small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Styphelia denticulata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
