    "intro": "Sagina saginoides subsp. parviflora, commonly known as lesser mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in grasslands, heaths, and along streambanks. Due to its compact growth and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
