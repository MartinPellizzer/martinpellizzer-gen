    "intro": "Schoenus brevisetis var. cygneus, commonly known as the Cygneus sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and summer months. Its inflorescence is usually a spike-like structure, and the seeds are dispersed by water or wind. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
