    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia subsp. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically flat and smooth on both surfaces. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
