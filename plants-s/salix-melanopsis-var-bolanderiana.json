    "intro": "Salix melanopsis var. bolanderiana, commonly known as Bolander's black willow, is a rare and endemic species native to California. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows along streambanks and moist soils. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
