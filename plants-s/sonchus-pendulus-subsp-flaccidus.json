    "intro": "Sonchus pendulus subsp. flaccidus, commonly known as the hanging sow thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often trail or hang down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas."
