    "intro": "Senecio resedifolius var. columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
