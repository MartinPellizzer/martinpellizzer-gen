    "intro": "Saxifraga rolwalingensis, commonly known as the Rolwaling saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from cold and UV radiation. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a single umbel at the top of the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing in alpine meadows and on mountain slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
