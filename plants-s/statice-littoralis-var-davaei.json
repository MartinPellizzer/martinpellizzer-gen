    "intro": "Statice littoralis var. davaei, commonly known as the coastal statice, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and seaside cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh coastal conditions."
