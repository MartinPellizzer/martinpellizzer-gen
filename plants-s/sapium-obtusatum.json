    "intro": "Sapium obtusatum, commonly known as the broadleaf sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in catkin-like clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The tree is also valued for its fast growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
