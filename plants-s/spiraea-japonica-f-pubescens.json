    "intro": "Spiraea japonica f. pubescens, commonly known as the Japanese weeping spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of white flowers. It features slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a slightly hairy texture that distinguishes the pubescens form from other varieties. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This cultivar is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
