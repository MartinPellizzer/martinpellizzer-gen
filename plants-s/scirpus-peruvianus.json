    "intro": "Scirpus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus peruvianus plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and wetland biodiversity."
