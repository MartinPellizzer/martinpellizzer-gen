    "intro": "Sempervivum balsamiferum, commonly known as the balsam strawberry, is a hardy succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its common name refers to the balsamic scent released when the leaves are crushed, adding to its aromatic appeal."
