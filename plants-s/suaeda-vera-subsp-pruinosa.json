    "intro": "Suaeda vera subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt tolerance is due to specialized cellular mechanisms that excrete excess sodium. Suaeda vera subsp. pruinosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
