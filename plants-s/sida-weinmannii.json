    "intro": "Sida weinmannii, commonly known as the velvetleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Sida weinmannii is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
