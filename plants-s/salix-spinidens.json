    "intro": "Salix spinidens, commonly known as the prickly willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a hardy plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix spinidens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
