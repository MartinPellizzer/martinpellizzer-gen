    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia, commonly known as the rowan or mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces berries that range in color from red to orange, depending on the variety, and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Sorbus aucuparia thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils and full sun to partial shade. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
