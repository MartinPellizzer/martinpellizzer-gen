    "intro": "Selaginella karsteniana, commonly known as the Karsten's spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often linear to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, sporangium-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Selaginella karsteniana is known for its resilience and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
