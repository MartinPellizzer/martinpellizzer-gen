    "intro": "Silene longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed catchfly, is a species of flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene longipes plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
