    "intro": "Symphysia floccosa, commonly known as the fluffball lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its white, woolly upper surface and a darker, leathery lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is often used as an indicator of air quality and ecological health."
