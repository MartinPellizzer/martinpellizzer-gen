    "intro": "Spiranthes cernua, commonly known as the nodding spirea, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are small and white or pale pink, often blooming in late summer. Spiranthes cernua is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
