    "intro": "Solidago yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and disturbed areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in panicles. Yukon goldenrod is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
