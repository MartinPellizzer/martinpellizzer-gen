    "intro": "Salsola boissieri subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, heavy metal-rich soils. It possesses succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and is often found in rocky, coastal, or semi-arid regions. Its ability to tolerate high levels of heavy metals like nickel and cadmium makes it ecologically significant in serpentine soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
