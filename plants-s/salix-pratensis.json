    "intro": "Salix pratensis, commonly known as the meadow willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant features slender, flexible stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix pratensis plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
