    "intro": "Salvia tubifera, commonly known as the tuberous sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of blue, violet, and purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system develops fleshy, tuberous structures that store nutrients, aiding in its survival during dry periods. Salvia tubifera is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
