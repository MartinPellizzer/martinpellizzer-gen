It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Silene aprica var. typica is often found in meadows and along woodland edges, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats."
