    "intro": "Senecio quillotensis, commonly known as the Quillotan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
