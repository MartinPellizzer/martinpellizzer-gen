    "intro": "Saussurea coarctata, commonly known as the Tibetan rhubarb or narrow-leaved saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional Tibetan and Ayurvedic medicine. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered."
