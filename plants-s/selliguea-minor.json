    "intro": "Selliguea minor, commonly known as the lesser rock moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a simple thalloid structure, with a green, leaf-like body that lacks true leaves, stems, or roots. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called sporophytes. Selliguea minor plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
