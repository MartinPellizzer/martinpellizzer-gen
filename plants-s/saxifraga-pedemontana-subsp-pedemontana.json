    "intro": "Saxifraga pedemontana subsp. pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
