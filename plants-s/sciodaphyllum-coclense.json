    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum coclense, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often pale green or almost translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found in the undergrowth of dense forest canopies. Sciodaphyllum coclense has small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by specific insect species, and its fruits are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss and limited research, it remains a poorly understood and endangered botanical specimen."
