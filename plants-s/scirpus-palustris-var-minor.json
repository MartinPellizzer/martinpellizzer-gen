    "intro": "Scirpus palustris var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a marsh plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
