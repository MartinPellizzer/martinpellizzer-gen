    "intro": "Stelis arcuata, commonly known as the arching stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces racemes of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. Stelis arcuata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
