    "intro": "Streptanthus bernardinus, commonly known as the Desert Cress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, mat-like growth habit to conserve moisture. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Streptanthus bernardinus is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
