It is characterized by its ribbed stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble apples, hence its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a notable species in desert ecosystems."
