    "intro": "Sisymbrium ciliatum, commonly known as the hoary cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a frosted appearance. It produces cylindrical pods that split open to release seeds, a characteristic common in the Brassicaceae family. Sisymbrium ciliatum is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
