    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua f. ramosa, commonly known as the trailing saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections."
