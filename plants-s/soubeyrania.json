It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble those of the iris, though it is not closely related. The plants typically have grass-like leaves and are often found in moist, tropical or subtropical environments. Soubeyrania species are known for their ornamental value and are cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
