    "intro": "Sisymbrium parvifolium, commonly known as small-leaved peppergrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous species. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
