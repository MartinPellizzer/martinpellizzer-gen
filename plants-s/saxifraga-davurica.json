    "intro": "Saxifraga davurica, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga davurica is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
