    "intro": "Sideritis incana subsp. altiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal and culinary uses. The plant is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
