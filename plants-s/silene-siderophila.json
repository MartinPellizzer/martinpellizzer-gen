    "intro": "Silene siderophila, commonly known as the ironweed or redstem sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Silene siderophila is often found in disturbed sites and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
