It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine. Its name reflects its pale, fuzzy appearance and its occurrence in western regions of its native range."
