It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a unique leaf structure that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
