    "intro": "Selaginella namdaphaensis, commonly known as the Namdapha spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
