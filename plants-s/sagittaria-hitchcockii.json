    "intro": "Sagittaria hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with distinctive white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Sagittaria hitchcockii is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for waterfowl."
