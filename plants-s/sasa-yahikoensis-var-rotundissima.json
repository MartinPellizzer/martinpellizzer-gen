It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and culms that are typically shorter and more robust than those of other bamboo species. The leaves are broad, rounded, and have a smooth texture, often with a bluish-green hue. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
