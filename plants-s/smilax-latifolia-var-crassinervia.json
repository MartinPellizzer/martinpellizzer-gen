    "intro": "Smilax latifolia var. crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-leafed smilax, is a variant of the smilax genus native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, thorny foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are broad and have prominent veins, giving it the \"crassinervia\" designation, which refers to its thick or broad nerve patterns. This variant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps."
