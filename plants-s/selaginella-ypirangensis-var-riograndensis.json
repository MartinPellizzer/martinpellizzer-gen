    "intro": "Selaginella ypirangensis var. riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of the stems, a feature common in many spikemosses. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
