    "intro": "Sideroxylon singuliflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish in color, and it produces distinctive, spiny fruits. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
