    "intro": "Salix rivulicola, commonly known as the stream willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in moist, often riparian environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it an important species for stabilizing streambanks and preventing erosion. Salix rivulicola is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its use in traditional landscaping."
