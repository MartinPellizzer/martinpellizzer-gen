It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive spiral arrangement of its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Saccolabium striatum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
