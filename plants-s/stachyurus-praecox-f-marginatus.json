    "intro": "Stachyurus praecox f. marginatus, commonly known as the margined stachyurus, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It features striking, finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by ornamental, red-brown berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a specimen plant. Its unique foliage and seasonal interest make it a valuable addition to the landscape."
