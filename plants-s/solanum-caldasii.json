    "intro": "Solanum caldasii, commonly known as the Caldasii nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum caldasii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
