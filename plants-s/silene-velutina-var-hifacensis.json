    "intro": "Silene velutina var. hifacensis, commonly known as the Hifacensis Blushflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking pink to red petals and hairy, velvety stems, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
