It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, often in mountainous regions. It features slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
