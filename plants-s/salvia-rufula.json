    "intro": "Salvia rufula, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Salvia rufula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
