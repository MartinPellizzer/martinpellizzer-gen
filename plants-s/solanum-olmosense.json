    "intro": "Solanum olmosense, commonly known as the Olmosense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age. Solanum olmosense is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
