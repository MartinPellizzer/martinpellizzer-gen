    "intro": "Saxifraga unguiculata var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate its roots in cold environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are usually smooth or only slightly hairy, distinguishing it from other varieties of Saxifraga unguiculata. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
