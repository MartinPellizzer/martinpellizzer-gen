It features waxy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are an important food source for various birds and mammals."
