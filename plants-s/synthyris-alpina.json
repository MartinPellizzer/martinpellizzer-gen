It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Synthyris alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
