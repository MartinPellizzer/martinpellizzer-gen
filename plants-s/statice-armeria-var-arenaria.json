It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly salt-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its drought resistance and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
