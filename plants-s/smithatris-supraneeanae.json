    "intro": "Smithatris supraneeanae, commonly known as the Supraneean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of native Australian eucalyptus trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing sticky pulp that aids in seed dispersal by birds. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
