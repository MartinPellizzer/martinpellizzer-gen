    "intro": "Saxifraga amplexifolia, commonly known as the clasping saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that tightly enclose the stem, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
