    "intro": "Streptopus mairei, commonly known as the Maire's star-tongue, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped foliage. The plant features slender, branching stems with finely dissected leaves that create a feathery appearance. Streptopus mairei thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
