    "intro": "Stapelia scutellata, commonly known as the hooded carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often foul-smelling flowers that mimic decaying flesh. The plant produces large, hood-shaped blooms in shades of yellow to orange, which attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Stapelia scutellata is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
