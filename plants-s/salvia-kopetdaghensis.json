    "intro": "Salvia kopetdaghensis, commonly known as Kopetdagh sage, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
