    "intro": "Scrophularia sambucifolia subvar. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple, and it produces clusters of tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The subspecies is distinguished by its more vibrant floral coloration compared to the typical form of S. sambucifolia."
