    "intro": "Symplocos diversifolia, commonly known as the variable evergreen holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Symplocos diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
