    "intro": "Sabicea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sabicea, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds. Sabicea pilosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
