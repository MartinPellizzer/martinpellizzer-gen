    "intro": "Stelis robustior, commonly known as the robust orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect or scrambling growth habit. The plant typically produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Stelis robustior is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
