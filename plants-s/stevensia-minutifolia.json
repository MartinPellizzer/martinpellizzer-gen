    "intro": "Stevensia minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf Stevensia, is a small, flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its tiny, delicate leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters. Stevensia minutifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
