    "intro": "Stelis modica, commonly known as the Modica stelis, is a species of orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of pink, purple, and white. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette formation, aiding in water retention. Stelis modica is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
