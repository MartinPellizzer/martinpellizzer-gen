These plants are typically herbaceous, with alternate, often palmate leaves that are hairy or glandular. They produce showy, often pink or purple flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Sida species are found in a variety of habitats, including arid regions, and some are adapted to saline soils. Many species are used in traditional medicine or as sources of fiber."
