    "intro": "Smilax immersa, commonly known as the watercress smilax, is a climbing perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny nodes, which help it to anchor itself to supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a heart-shaped base, often with a rough texture. Smilax immersa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swamps, stream banks, and wooded areas."
