It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms a rosette of basal leaves. Its fibrous roots are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
