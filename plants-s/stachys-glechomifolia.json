It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Stachys glechomifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
