    "intro": "Sesuvium repens, commonly known as seaside daisy, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to coastal regions of the Americas. It has fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and drought. Its ability to stabilize coastal dunes makes it an important pioneer species in maritime ecosystems."
