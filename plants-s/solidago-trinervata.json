    "intro": "Solidago trinervata, commonly known as the three-veined goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, disk-like flowers clustered in panicles. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have three distinct veins, giving it its common name. Solidago trinervata plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in wetland ecosystems."
