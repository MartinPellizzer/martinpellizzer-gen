    "intro": "Stelis lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, hairy stem and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
