    "intro": "Senecio mweroensis subsp. leptophyllus, commonly known as the slender-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the highland regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
