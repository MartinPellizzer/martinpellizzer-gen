It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, such as flies and beetles. Stapelia tsomoensis is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
