    "intro": "Stelis speckmaieri, commonly known as the Speck's stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis speckmaieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
