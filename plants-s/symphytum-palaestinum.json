It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of blue to purple flowers. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid environments."
