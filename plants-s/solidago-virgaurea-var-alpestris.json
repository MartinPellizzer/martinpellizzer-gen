    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variant is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
