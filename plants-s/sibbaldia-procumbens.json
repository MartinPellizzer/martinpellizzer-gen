    "intro": "Sibbaldia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with small, hairy leaves and pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and subalpine ecosystems. Sibbaldia procumbens is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
