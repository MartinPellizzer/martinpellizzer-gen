    "intro": "Stevia scabrelloides, commonly known as the Brazilian sweet leaf, is a species native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a natural sweetener. Due to its low water requirement, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
