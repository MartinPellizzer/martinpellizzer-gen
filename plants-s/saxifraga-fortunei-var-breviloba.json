    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This variety is popular in rock gardens and as a hardy ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
