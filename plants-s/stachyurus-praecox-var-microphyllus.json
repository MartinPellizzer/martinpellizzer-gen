It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm in length, giving it a compact and neat appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and showy, early blooming flowers. It prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a specimen plant."
