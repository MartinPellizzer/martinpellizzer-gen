    "intro": "Sium angustifolium var. repens, commonly known as narrow-leaved waterparsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. Small white flowers appear in umbels during the summer months, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It is often found in moist soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks."
