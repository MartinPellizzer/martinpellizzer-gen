    "intro": "Sideritis leucantha var. oblongifolia, commonly known as white heather or white mountain tea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white to pale green hairy foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. This variety is valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
