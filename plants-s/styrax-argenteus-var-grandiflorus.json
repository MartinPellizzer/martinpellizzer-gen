It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exuding a resinous scent. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and showy blooms."
