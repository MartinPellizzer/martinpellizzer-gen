    "intro": "Sorghum durra var. fecundum, commonly known as giant durra, is a robust, tall grass native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its large, narrow leaves and tall, branching stalks that can reach heights of up to 4 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny grains. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, showing high drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its use in traditional brewing and as a source of animal feed."
