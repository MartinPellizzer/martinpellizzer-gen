    "intro": "Silphium integrifolium var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milkweed sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. This species plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
