    "intro": "Stevia salicifolia, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation. Stevia salicifolia is also valued for its use in natural sweeteners and traditional medicine."
