    "intro": "Stellaria ruscifolia subsp. aleutica, commonly known as Aleutian starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal zones and along rocky shores. This subspecies is well adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native habitat."
