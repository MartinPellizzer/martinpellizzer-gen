    "intro": "Semarillaria acutangula, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive lip, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Semarillaria acutangula is considered a rare and endangered species."
