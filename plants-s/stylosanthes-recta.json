It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and elliptical. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Stylosanthes recta is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a valuable forage crop in arid and semi-arid environments. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen improves soil fertility and supports sustainable agricultural practices."
