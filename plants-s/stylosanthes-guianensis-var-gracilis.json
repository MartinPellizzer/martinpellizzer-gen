    "intro": "Stylosanthes guianensis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender stylosanthes, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variety is adapted to dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a valuable forage plant in tropical regions."
