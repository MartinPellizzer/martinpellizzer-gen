    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon ellipticum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate elliptic stigmaphyllon, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
