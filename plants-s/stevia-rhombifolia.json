    "intro": "Stevia rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its rhombic-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are used to make a natural sweetener, similar to the more well-known Stevia rebaudiana. Stevia rhombifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
