    "intro": "Sorghum papillosum, commonly known as the hairy sorghum, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stalks and panicles of small, greenish flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow florets that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water availability. Its botanical features make it both an important forage plant and a potential source of biofuel."
