    "intro": "Swainsona longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair swainsona, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with long, slender petals that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Swainsona longipilosa is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
