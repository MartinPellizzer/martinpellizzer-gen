    "intro": "Sagina nodosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, prostrate stems that are covered in glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted for water storage. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in dense clusters at the stem tips. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appearance in rock gardens."
