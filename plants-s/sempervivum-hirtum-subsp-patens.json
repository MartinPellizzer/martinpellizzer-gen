    "intro": "Sempervivum hirtum subsp. patens, commonly known as the silver carpet sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and can thrive in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
