    "intro": "Stachys sessiliflora, commonly known as purple deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs and have a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Stachys sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
