It is a small, evergreen, vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive zigzag pattern in its stems, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are small, linear, and arranged in a spiral, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Selaginella trygonoides is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
