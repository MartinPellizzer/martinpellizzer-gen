    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea subsp. erraticus, commonly known as the Great Basin ragwort, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It is characterized by its sparsely leafy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
