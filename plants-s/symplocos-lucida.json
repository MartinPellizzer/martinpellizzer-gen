    "intro": "Symplocos lucida, commonly known as the shining evergreen or silverleaf inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Symplocos lucida is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to support local wildlife."
