    "intro": "Sporobolus balansae, commonly known as Balansae dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in arid environments. Sporobolus balansae is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
