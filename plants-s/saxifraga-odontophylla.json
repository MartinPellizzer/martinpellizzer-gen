    "intro": "Saxifraga odontophylla, commonly known as the toothed leaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their serrated or toothed margins, which give it its common name. Saxifraga odontophylla is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
