It features elongated, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest environments.
