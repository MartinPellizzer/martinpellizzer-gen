    "intro": "Stevia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is renowned for containing high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Its leaves are typically used fresh or dried to impart a sweet flavor without caloric content. Stevia angustifolia is often cultivated for both commercial and ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and medicinal properties."
