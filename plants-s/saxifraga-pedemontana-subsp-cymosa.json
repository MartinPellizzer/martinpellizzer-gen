    "intro": "Saxifraga pedemontana subsp. cymosa, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in cymes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered with a fine layer of white wax. This subspecies is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
