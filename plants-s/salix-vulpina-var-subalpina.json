    "intro": "Salix vulpina var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in alpine meadows. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments."
