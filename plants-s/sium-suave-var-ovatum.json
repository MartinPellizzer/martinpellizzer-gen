    "intro": "Sium suave var. ovatum, commonly known as sweet waterparsley, is a variant of the waterparsley plant native to wetland areas in North America. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, aromatic stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for culinary use, though it is less common than the standard variety. This variant is adapted to moist soils and is often found near streams and marshes."
