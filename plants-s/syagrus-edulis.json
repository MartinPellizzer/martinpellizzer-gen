    "intro": "Syagrus edulis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The tree produces large, compound fruits that contain multiple seeds, each enclosed in a hard, woody shell. These seeds are the edible Brazil nuts, which are rich in nutrients and oils. The plant plays a significant role in both ecological and economic systems in its native habitat."
