    "intro": "Senecio lorentzii var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are broad and often have a woolly or hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The showy yellow flowers appear in the spring and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
