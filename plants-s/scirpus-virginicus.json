It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical spikes of small, brown flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. Its roots help filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus virginicus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water quality."
