    "intro": "Sonerila stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sonerila, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface. Sonerila stolonifera spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its natural habitat."
