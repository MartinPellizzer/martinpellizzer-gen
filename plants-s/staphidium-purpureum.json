    "intro": "Staphidium purpureum, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, often purple-tinged leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in harsh, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Staphidium purpureum is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment."
