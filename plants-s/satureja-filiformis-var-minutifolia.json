    "intro": "Satureja filiformis var. minutifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved savory, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, thread-like leaves that are densely packed along its creeping stems. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic foliage is used in cooking and traditional medicine for its pungent, slightly minty scent."
