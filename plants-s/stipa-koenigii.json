    "intro": "Stipa koenigii, commonly known as the purple false oat, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense spikes of purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa koenigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
