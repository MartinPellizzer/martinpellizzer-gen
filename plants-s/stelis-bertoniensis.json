    "intro": "Stelis bertoniensis, commonly known as the Bertoni's spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic. The flowers are usually pale green or white with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects."
