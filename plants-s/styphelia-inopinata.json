    "intro": "Styphelia inopinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the wet heathlands of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, evergreen leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in spring. Styphelia inopinata is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for native pollinators."
