    "intro": "Solanum sarmentosum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers, followed by yellow, egg-shaped berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
