    "intro": "Scorzonera hispidula, commonly known as the hairy scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets that bloom in late summer. Scorzonera hispidula is sometimes cultivated for its edible tubers, though it is more commonly found in wild settings."
