    "intro": "Shorea uliginosa, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, heavy wood and is often found in brackish or saline wetlands. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release buoyant seeds for dispersal in water. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
