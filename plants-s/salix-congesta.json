    "intro": "Salix congesta, commonly known as the clustered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix congesta thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in tundra and wetland habitats. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems."
