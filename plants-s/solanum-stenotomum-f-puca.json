    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. puca, commonly known as the purple-fruited nightshade, is a distinctive variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its striking purple to almost black berries, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique fruit color and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
