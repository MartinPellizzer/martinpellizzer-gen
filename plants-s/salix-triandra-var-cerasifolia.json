    "intro": "Salix triandra var. cerasifolia, commonly known as the cherry-sweet willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
