    "intro": "Strychnos davidsei, commonly known as David's strychnos, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. The plant has limited commercial use but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
