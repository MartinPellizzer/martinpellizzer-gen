    "intro": "Salix cordata f. mollis, commonly known as silky willow, is a shrub characterized by its soft, silken-textured leaves. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth, velvety surface that distinguishes it from other willow species. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
