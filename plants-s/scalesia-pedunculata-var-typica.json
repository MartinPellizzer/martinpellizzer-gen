    "intro": "Scalesia pedunculata var. typica, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos pine, is a unique evergreen tree native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, which provides habitat for various endemic species. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, and its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in whorls. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor volcanic soils of the islands. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a key species in the Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystem."
