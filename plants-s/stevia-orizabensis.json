It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in dry, rocky environments. Stevia orizabensis is valued both for its medicinal properties and its use in traditional herbal remedies."
