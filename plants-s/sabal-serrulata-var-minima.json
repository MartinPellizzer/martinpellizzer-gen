    "intro": "Sabal serrulata var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf cabbage palm, is a compact variety of the cabbage palm native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its short, clustered stems and rosette-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange to red fruits, which contain seeds. It is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, often growing in sandy soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
