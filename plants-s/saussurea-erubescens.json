    "intro": "Saussurea erubescens, commonly known as the red safflower or red ginseng, is a flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau and other high-altitude regions of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces a dark red or purple root that is highly valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in cool, arid environments and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Due to its medicinal properties and limited natural habitat, it is often cultivated for commercial use."
