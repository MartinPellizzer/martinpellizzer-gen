    "intro": "Spodiopogon ramosus, commonly known as the hairy grass or Chinese hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive hairy texture that gives it its common name. Spodiopogon ramosus is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
