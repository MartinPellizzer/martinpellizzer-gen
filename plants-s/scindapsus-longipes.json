    "intro": "Scindapsus longipes, commonly known as the silver vine or marble queen, is a member of the Araceae family. It is a climbing or trailing plant native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that often display a striking silver or variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Scindapsus longipes is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
