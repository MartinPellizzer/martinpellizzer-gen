    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 heimerlii, commonly known as the Weeping Willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
