It features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Senecio theifolius is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments and is often found in grasslands and shrublands."
