    "intro": "Schoenus triceps, commonly known as the three-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as bogs and wet meadows, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive structures consist of spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus triceps plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
