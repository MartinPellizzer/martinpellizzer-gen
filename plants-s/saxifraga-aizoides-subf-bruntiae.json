    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoides subf. bruntiae, commonly known as the Brunt's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
