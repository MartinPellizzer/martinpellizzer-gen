    "intro": "Stewartia dentata, commonly known as the Japanese stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split open to release seeds. Its foliage turns a striking yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Stewartia dentata is valued in horticulture for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
