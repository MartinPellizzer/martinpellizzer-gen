    "intro": "Selinum coniifolium var. filicifolia, commonly known as the fernleaf cowparsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are pinnately divided, resembling fern fronds. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
