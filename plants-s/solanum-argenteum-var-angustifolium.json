    "intro": "Solanum argenteum var. angustifolium, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring. Its berries are initially green and turn red when ripe, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. This species is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in full sun."
