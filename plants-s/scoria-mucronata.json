It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, grayish foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces slender, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of tiny florets.
