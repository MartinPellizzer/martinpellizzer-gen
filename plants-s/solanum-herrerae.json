    "intro": "Solanum herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. Solanum herrerae thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
