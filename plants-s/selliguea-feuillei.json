    "intro": "Selliguea feuillei, commonly known as the giant wall moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its large, succulent, and often brightly colored thallus, which can grow up to several centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and forest floors. Its structure consists of a leafy stem with closely packed, overlapping leaves that form a dense mat. Selliguea feuillei is notable for its ability to retain water and its role in soil stabilization in its natural habitat."
