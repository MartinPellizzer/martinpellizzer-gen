    "intro": "Solanum gundlachii, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries. The berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities."
