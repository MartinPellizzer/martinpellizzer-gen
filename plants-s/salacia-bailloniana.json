    "intro": "Salacia bailloniana, commonly known as the Baillon's salacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Salacia bailloniana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
