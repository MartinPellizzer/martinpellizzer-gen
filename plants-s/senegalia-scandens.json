    "intro": "Senegalia scandens, commonly known as the catclaw acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. Senegalia scandens is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
