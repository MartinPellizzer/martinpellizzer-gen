    "intro": "Sagittaria trachysepala, commonly known as the rough arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture, giving it its common name. Its small white flowers appear in clusters above the water, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water. Sagittaria trachysepala is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and improve water quality."
