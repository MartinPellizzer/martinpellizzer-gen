It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and the flowers bloom from late summer to early autumn. Statice besseriana is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in floral arrangements and as a cut flower."
