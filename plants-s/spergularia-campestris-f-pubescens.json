    "intro": "Spergularia campestris f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically linear to ovate in shape. The pubescent (hairy) foliage of this variety distinguishes it from other forms of Spergularia campestris. It is a perennial species that thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often in disturbed or open habitats."
