It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
