    "intro": "Senna mexicana var. shaferi, commonly known as the Mexican senna, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Senna mexicana var. shaferi is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
