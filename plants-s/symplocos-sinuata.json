    "intro": "Symplocos sinuata, commonly known as the Sinuous Almond. It is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Symplocos sinuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
