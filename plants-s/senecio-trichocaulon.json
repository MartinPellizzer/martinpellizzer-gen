    "intro": "Senecio trichocaulon, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Senecio trichocaulon produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
