    "intro": "Sebastiania glabrescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Sebastiania glabrescens is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in humid, warm climates."
