    "intro": "Stekhovia scapigera, commonly known as the scarlet sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, bright red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Stekhovia scapigera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
