    "intro": "Selenicereus donkelaarii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Selenicereus donkelaarii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
