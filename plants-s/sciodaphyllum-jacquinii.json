    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's sun-leaf, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a fan. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciodaphyllum jacquinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
