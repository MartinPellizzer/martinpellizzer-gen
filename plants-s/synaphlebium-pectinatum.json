    "intro": "Synaphlebium pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinatum lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its nutritional needs. It is typically found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
