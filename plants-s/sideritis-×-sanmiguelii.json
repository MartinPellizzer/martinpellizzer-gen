    "intro": "Sideritis \u00d7 sanmiguelii, commonly known as San Miguel's sainfoin, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across rocky and open habitats. Sideritis \u00d7 sanmiguelii is often found in dry, sunny environments such as steppes and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant taxonomy and ecological adaptation."
