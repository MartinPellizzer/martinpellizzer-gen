    "intro": "Schizachyrium neomexicanum, commonly known as New Mexico grass or silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, silver-blue foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for wildlife in arid and semi-arid regions."
