    "intro": "Spiranthes praecox, commonly known as the early spiraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescences of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind. Spiranthes praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
