    "intro": "Stipa trochlearis, commonly known as the mountain grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa trochlearis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low nutrient soils. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
