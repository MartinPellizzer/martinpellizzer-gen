    "intro": "Stapelia schinzii var. angolensis, commonly known as the Angola star cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Stapelia schinzii var. angolensis is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
