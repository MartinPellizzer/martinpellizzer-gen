It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its heavy, dark-colored heartwood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant exhibits typical tropical rainforest tree features, including buttressed roots and a tall, straight trunk. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers and is an important component of the forest ecosystem."
