    "intro": "Salix gracilistyla subsp. melanostachys, commonly known as the black-stalked willow, is a shrub native to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, elliptical leaves that are usually densely hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins that are typically dark brown or black, giving it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in moist, rocky soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its harsh habitat."
