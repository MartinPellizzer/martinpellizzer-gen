    "intro": "Stylosanthes rigida, commonly known as the rigid stylosanthe, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often used in forage systems due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. Stylosanthes rigida has also been studied for its potential in soil nitrogen fixation and erosion control."
