    "intro": "Sida aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian cotton or thorn cotton, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its deep root system. Sida aegyptiaca is also known for its historical use in textile production, as its fibers were once used to make cotton-like fabrics."
