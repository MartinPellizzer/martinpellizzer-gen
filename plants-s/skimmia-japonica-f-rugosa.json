It features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its slow growth and ability to tolerate frost."
