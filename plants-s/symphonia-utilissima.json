    "intro": "Symphonia utilissima, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has a straight trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with dark green, opposite leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing seeds. Due to its slow growth and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
