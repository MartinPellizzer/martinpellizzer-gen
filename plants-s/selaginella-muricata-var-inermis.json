    "intro": "Selaginella muricata var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features closely packed, needle-like leaves that are smooth and lack the spines found in other varieties of Selaginella. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are usually found at the tips of its stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
