    "intro": "Sorghum miliiforme var. rotundulum, commonly known as the round-seeded millet, is a small-grained cereal plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, round grains that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. The plant produces panicles of spikelets, which contain the edible seeds used for food and animal feed. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it an important crop in semi-arid regions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system that helps it conserve water efficiently."
