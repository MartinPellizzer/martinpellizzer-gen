    "intro": "Schoenus flavus, commonly known as the yellow bulrush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Schoenus flavus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
