    "intro": "Solanum absconditum, commonly known as the hidden nightshade, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that open at night, and its dark purple berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its secretive habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and difficult to study. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from habitat loss and overcollection."
