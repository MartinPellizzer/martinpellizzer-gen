It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green with a reddish or brownish hue on the stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense mats on the forest floor. Saccoloma lherminieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
