    "intro": "Salix arctica var. caespitosa, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a deciduous plant that typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, forming dense cushions or mats. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This hardy species is adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in nutrient-poor soils and enduring harsh winters."
