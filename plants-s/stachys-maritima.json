    "intro": "Stachys maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its tubular flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. Stachys maritima is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
