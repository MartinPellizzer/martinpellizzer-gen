    "intro": "Sida ramoniana, commonly known as Ramon's cotton, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough texture and a slight pubescence. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds."
