    "intro": "Spiraea \u00d7 oblongifolia, commonly known as the hybrid meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright stems covered in small, ovate to elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of fluffy, white to pinkish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its foliage is often a striking bronze or red in the autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Spiraea \u00d7 oblongifolia is well-suited for garden use, particularly in borders or as a specimen plant due to its compact growth habit and showy blooms."
