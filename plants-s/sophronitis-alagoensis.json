    "intro": "Sophronitis alagoensis, commonly known as the Alagoas orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Brazilian state of Alagoas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the rainy season. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to thrive in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
