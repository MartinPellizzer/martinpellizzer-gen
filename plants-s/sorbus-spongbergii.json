    "intro": "Sorbus spongbergii, commonly known as the Spongberg whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries that mature in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. Sorbus spongbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and adaptability to various soil types."
