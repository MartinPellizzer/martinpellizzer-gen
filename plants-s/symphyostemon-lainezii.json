It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
