    "intro": "Silaum serotinum, commonly known as silybum or milk thistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its distinctive leaves with spiny edges and a blue or purple flower head. The plant contains a milky sap, which is responsible for its common name. Its most notable feature is the presence of silymarin, a group of flavonoids with potential liver-protecting properties. Silaum serotinum is often cultivated for its medicinal uses and ornamental value."
