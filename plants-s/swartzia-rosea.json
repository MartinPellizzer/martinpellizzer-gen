    "intro": "Swartzia rosea, commonly known as the pink wood or rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued in furniture-making. The plant typically grows as a medium to large tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad canopy and compound leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often pink or red, and it produces pods that contain flattened seeds. Due to its economic value and habitat loss, Swartzia rosea is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
