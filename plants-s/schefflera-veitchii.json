    "intro": "Schefflera veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Schefflera veitchii thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
