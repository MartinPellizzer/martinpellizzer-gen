    "intro": "Saxifraga rudolphiana, commonly known as the Rudolph's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer. Saxifraga rudolphiana is often found in mountainous areas and is a characteristic component of alpine flora."
