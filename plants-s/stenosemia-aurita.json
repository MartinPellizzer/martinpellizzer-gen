    "intro": "Stenosemia aurita, commonly known as the golden-eyed grasshopper, is a species of planthopper belonging to the family Cercopidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive golden markings on its wings. The plant is not a true plant but an insect, so it does not have botanical features like leaves, roots, or flowers. Instead, it feeds on the sap of plants, primarily in the family Poaceae. Its role in the ecosystem is mainly as a herbivore, contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators."
