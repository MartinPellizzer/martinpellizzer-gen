    "intro": "Sagina occidentalis, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in clusters. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
