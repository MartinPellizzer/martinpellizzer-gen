    "intro": "Stellaria holostea var. apetala, commonly known as the leafy starwort, is a variant of the starwort plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically blooms with tiny white or pink flowers, although this variety is notable for its lack of petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties. The species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
