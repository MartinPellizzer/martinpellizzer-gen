    "intro": "Sagina micropetala, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along paths. It is characterized by its ability to spread through both seeds and stolons, making it a persistent weed in some environments."
