It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow composite flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
