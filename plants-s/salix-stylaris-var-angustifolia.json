    "intro": "Salix stylaris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
