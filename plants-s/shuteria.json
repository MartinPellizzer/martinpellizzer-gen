    "intro": "Shuteria, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to deep purple. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Shuteria blooms in spring and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
