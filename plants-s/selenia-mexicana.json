    "intro": "Selenia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican selenia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Selenia mexicana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry climates."
