    "intro": "Salix myrtilloides var. hypoglauca, commonly known as the smooth willow or white willow, is a variant of the black willow species native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, flexible branches and small, ovate leaves that are often a pale green on the underside. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
