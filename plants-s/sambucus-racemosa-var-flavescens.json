    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for humans and birds but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
