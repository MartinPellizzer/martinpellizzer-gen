    "intro": "Saxifraga flagrans, commonly known as the spreading saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it well adapted to harsh mountainous terrain. Saxifraga flagrans is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
