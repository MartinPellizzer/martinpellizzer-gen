    "intro": "Stachys hebens, commonly known as mother-of-thousands, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and produces numerous offsets that help it spread rapidly. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
