    "intro": "Scilla minor, commonly known as lesser scilla, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features delicate, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Scilla minor is known for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time, creating dense patches of color in the spring."
