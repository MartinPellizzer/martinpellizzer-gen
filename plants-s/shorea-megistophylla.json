It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and sprawling canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, spiky fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it an important resource in local economies. The plant plays a crucial role in tropical ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
