    "intro": "Sisyrinchium bromelioides subsp. angustius, commonly known as narrowleaf blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive central white stripe. The plant produces small, showy blue to violet flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
