    "intro": "Sorbus microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Sorbus microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
