    "intro": "Sicelium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a type of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, sword-like fronds that are typically evergreen and can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Sicelium has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that produce new fronds and roots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
