    "intro": "Sideroxylon reclinatum subsp. reclinatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically has opposite, elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland rainforests or secondary forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
