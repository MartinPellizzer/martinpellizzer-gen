It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow ray flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
