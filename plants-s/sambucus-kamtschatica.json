    "intro": "Sambucus kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of the Pacific Rim. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but contain seeds that are toxic if ingested in large quantities. Sambucus kamtschatica is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas."
