    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata f. compacta, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings."
