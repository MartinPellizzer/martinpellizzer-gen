    "intro": "Salix phillyreifolia, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, silky-haired leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are typically male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, round, brown fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Salix phillyreifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
