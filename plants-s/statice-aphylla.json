    "intro": "Statice aphylla, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Statice aphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
