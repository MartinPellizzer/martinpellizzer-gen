    "intro": "Sagittaria potamogetifolia, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water and wetlands, characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Sagittaria potamogetifolia is also a food source for various waterfowl and aquatic insects."
