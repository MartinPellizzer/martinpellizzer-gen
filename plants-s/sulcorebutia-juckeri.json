It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and distinctive crown of spines. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters, with a dense, woolly covering that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. Sulcorebutia juckeri is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
