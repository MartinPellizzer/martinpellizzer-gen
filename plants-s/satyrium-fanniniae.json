    "intro": "Satyrium fanniniae, commonly known as the Fannin's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species, which plays a role in pollination. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
