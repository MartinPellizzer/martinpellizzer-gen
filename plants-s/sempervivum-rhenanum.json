    "intro": "Sempervivum rhenanum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Sempervivum rhenanum is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
