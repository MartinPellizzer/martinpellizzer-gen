    "intro": "Saxifraga tsarongensis, commonly known as the Tsarong saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically in June or July. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
