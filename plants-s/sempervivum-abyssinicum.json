    "intro": "Sempervivum abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of Ethiopia. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ability to thrive in poor soil and full sun makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
