    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. excelsa, commonly known as the white meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered with silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which are arranged in corymbs. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Spiraea ulmaria var. excelsa is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full sun."
