    "intro": "Sciaphila crinita, commonly known as the hair-root orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with long, hairy roots, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Sciaphila crinita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
