    "intro": "Sedum linearifolium var. ovatisepalum, commonly known as the broad-sepal sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to propagate through both seeds and offsets."
