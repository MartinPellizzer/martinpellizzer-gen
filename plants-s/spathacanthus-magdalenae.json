It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is part of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
