    "intro": "Salvinia azolla, commonly known as water fern or mosquito fern, is a free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Salviniaceae. It forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies, which can significantly impact water quality and light penetration. The plant is characterized by its small, floating leaves and root-like structures that anchor it to the water substrate. It is known for its rapid growth rate, often doubling its biomass within days under favorable conditions. Salvinia azolla is also recognized for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems."
