    "intro": "Spirodela oligorrhiza var. pleiorrhiza, commonly known as the greater sparrow's nest, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a broad, oval-shaped leaf that is usually green to reddish in color, with a waxy surface that aids in water repellence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, arranged in clusters at the leaf nodes. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and ditches. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable aquatic vegetation and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
