    "intro": "Sanguisorba polygama var. platylopha, commonly known as the broadleaf sanguisorba, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
