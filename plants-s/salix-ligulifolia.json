    "intro": "Salix ligulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. Salix ligulifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
