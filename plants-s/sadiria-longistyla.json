It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that consist of both male and female flowers, typical of many Cyperaceae species. Sadiria longistyla is often found in shallow water or moist soil, where it plays a role in stabilizing the ecosystem. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland biodiversity."
