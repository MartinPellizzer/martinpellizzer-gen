    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subsp. aguaraquiya, commonly known as black nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which transition from green to black as they mature. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their raw form. It is native to various regions in South America and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
