    "intro": "Smilax hostmanniana, commonly known as the prickly pear or yellow smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins. Smilax hostmanniana is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
