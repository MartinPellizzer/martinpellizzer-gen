    "intro": "Stipa leptogluma, commonly known as slender glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Stipa leptogluma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
