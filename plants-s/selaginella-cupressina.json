    "intro": "Selaginella cupressina, commonly known as the clubmoss or creeping clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, needle-like leaves that form dense mats. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella cupressina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in specific microhabitats."
