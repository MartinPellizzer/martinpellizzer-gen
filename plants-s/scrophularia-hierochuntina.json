It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Scrophularia hierochuntina is a relatively rare species, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
