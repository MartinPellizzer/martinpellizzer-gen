    "intro": "Sorghum villosum, commonly known as hairy sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in panicles, typical of the grass family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Hairy sorghum is often used for forage and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native regions."
