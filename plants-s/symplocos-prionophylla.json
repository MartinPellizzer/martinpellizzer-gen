    "intro": "Symplocos prionophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Symplocos prionophylla typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
