    "intro": "Salacia brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Salacia brachypoda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
