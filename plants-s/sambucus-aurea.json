    "intro": "Sambucus aurea, commonly known as the dwarf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
