    "intro": "Silene jucunda, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, pale green to blue-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Silene jucunda thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, dry conditions."
