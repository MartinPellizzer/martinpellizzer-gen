    "intro": "Sclerocactus mesae-verdae subsp. mesae-verdae, commonly known as the Chihuahuan Desert hedgehog cactus, is a spineless, cylindrical cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas. It has a compact, ribbed structure with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts but is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
