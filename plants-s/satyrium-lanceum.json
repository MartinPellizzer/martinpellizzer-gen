    "intro": "Satyrium lanceum, commonly known as the lanceleaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and reduced foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and lack a distinct scent, which is typical for many orchids. The species is notable for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption."
