    "intro": "Stellaria media var. major, commonly known as greater mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are often succulent and arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new areas."
