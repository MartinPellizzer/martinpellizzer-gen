    "intro": "Sisyrinchium junceum var. asperulum, commonly known as roughleaf bluecup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly rough foliage compared to other varieties of Sisyrinchium."
