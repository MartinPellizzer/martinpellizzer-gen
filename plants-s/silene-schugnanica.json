    "intro": "Silene schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnanica catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene schugnanica is considered a rare and endangered species."
