It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Sasa hayatae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
