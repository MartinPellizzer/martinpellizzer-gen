    "intro": "Sepalosaccus, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins and a rough texture. Its sepals are fused at the base, forming a distinctive sac-like structure, from which the genus name is derived. Sepalosaccus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
