    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 gemmia, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree that combines the characteristics of its parent species, Salix alba and Salix triandra. It is known for its cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance, often drooping to the ground. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a silvery underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. Salix \u00d7 gemmia is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and along water features due to its graceful form and adaptability."
