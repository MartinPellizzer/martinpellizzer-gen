    "intro": "Scirpus vaginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often wrapped around the stems, forming a sheath-like structure. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Scirpus vaginatus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
