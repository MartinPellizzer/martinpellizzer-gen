    "intro": "Sonchus metzianus, commonly known as the silverleaf weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many agricultural and natural settings."
