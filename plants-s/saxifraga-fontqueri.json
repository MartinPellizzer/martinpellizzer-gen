    "intro": "Saxifraga fontqueri, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, alpine environment. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and along stream banks. Saxifraga fontqueri is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
