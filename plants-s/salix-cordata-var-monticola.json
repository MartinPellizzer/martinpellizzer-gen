    "intro": "Salix cordata var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine down, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
