    "intro": "Swertia tetrapetala f. papillosa, commonly known as the papillate swertia, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Swertia genus. It is a herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, typically found in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive papillate texture on the underside, giving it its specific epithet. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but poorly studied species."
