    "intro": "Spatalla nana, commonly known as the dwarf spatalla, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, clustered leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. Spatalla nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or dry environments."
