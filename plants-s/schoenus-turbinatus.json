    "intro": "Schoenus turbinatus, commonly known as the turban grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in coastal areas or seasonally flooded habitats. Schoenus turbinatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
