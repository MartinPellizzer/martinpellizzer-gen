    "intro": "Symphyotrichum foliaceum var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to the typical foliaceum."
