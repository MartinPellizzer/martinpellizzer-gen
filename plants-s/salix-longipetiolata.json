    "intro": "Salix longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, oval leaves that are typically green on top and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
