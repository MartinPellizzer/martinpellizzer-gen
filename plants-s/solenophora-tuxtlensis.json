    "intro": "Solenophora tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtlans ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the humid cloud forests of Veracruz, Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, translucent petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically white or pale green, and they emit a subtle fragrance to attract pollinators. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
