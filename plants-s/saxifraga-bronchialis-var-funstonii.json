    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis var. funstonii, commonly known as the Funston's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States, particularly Texas. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its native environment, though it is relatively rare and has specific ecological requirements."
