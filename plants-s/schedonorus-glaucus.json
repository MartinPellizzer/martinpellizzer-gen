    "intro": "Schedonorus glaucus, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often waterlogged habitat. Schedonorus glaucus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
