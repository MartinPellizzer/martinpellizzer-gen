    "intro": "Selaginella pubimarginata, commonly known as the mossy spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and produce spores, which are essential for its propagation. Selaginella pubimarginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
