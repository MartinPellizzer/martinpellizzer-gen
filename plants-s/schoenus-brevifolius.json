    "intro": "Schoenus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved sedgeland grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are short and densely packed, forming a dense mat or clump. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus brevifolius plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
