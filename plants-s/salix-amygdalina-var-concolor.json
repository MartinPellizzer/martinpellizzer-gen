    "intro": "Salix amygdalina var. concolor, commonly known as the white willow or Chinese white willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a finely toothed margin and a pale green underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are male and female flowers arranged in separate clusters. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its salicin content."
