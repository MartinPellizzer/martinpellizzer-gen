    "intro": "Sclerocactus nyensis, commonly known as the New Mexico hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of New Mexico and Texas. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, desert environments. Sclerocactus nyensis is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
