    "intro": "Strongylodon siderospermus, commonly known as the ironseed plant, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its robust, woody structure and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, hard seeds. Its unique seed morphology, with seeds containing iron-rich compounds, has led to its common name. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats."
