    "intro": "Struthanthus sarmentosus, commonly known as the trailing struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Struthanthus sarmentosus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
