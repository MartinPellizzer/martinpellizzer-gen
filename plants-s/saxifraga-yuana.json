    "intro": "Saxifraga yuana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga yuana is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
