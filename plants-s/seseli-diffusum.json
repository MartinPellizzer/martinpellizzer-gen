It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spherical fruits called schizocarps, which disperse by wind. Seseli diffusum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings."
