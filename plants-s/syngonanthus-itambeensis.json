    "intro": "Syngonanthus itambeensis, commonly known as the Itambe grass, is a perennial herb native to the humid lowland forests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Syngonanthus itambeensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
