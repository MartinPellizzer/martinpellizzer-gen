    "intro": "Saxifraga cordigera, commonly known as the heart-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Saxifraga cordigera is well adapted to harsh climates, with a short growing season and the ability to store water in its thick leaves."
