    "intro": "Sabulina patula, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Sabulina patula is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
