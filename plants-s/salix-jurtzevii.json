    "intro": "Salix jurtzevii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in harsh, arctic or subarctic conditions. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of willow species, and its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. Salix jurtzevii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in difficult environments."
