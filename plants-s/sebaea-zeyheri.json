    "intro": "Sebaea zeyheri, commonly known as the Cape ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its woody stems are strong and fibrous, which contribute to its common name. Sebaea zeyheri is often used in coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and drought conditions."
