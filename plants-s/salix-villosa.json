    "intro": "Salix villosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and silvery-white, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water bodies. Salix villosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
