    "intro": "Solanum pycnanthemum, commonly known as purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and features a distinctive conical shape formed by its clustered flower heads. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Solanum pycnanthemum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
