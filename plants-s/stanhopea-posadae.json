    "intro": "Stanhopea posadae, commonly known as the Posada's stanhopea, is a rare orchid native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with purple markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and over-collection."
