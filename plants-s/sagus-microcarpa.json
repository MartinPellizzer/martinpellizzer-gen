    "intro": "Sagus microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited saguaro, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is a slow-growing cactus that can reach heights of up to 20 feet, featuring a ribbed, cylindrical stem with a distinctive crown of branches. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in arid conditions by efficiently absorbing rainwater. The saguaro is an ecologically important species, providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife."
