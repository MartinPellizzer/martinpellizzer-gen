    "intro": "Selliguea connexa, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and the absence of true roots, stems, and leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in damp soil. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are prominent and contribute to its reproductive strategy. Selliguea connexa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
