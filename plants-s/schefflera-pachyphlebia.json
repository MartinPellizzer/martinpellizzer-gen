    "intro": "Schefflera pachyphlebia, commonly known as the thick-veined schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of compound leaves, which give it a distinctive, lush appearance. The plant has smooth, dark green foliage with prominent veins that are often visible on the upper surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Schefflera pachyphlebia is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
