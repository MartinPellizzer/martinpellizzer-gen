    "intro": "Satureja mucronifolia, commonly known as Sierra grassvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant features slender, aromatic stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, minty fragrance. Its flowers are tiny, pink to purple, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming in the summer months. Satureja mucronifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils."
