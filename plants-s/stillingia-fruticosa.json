    "intro": "Stillingia fruticosa, commonly known as redroot, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Stillingia fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
