    "intro": "Silene iconia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silene iconia is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to drought and high temperatures."
