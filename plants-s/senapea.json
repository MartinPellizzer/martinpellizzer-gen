    "intro": "Senapea, commonly known as the sweetroot or wild parsnip, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains a variety of bioactive compounds, including coumarins, which can cause skin irritation upon contact with sunlight. Senapea is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
