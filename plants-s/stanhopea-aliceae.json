    "intro": "Stanhopea aliceae, commonly known as Alice's stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Stanhopea aliceae is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and rarity, though it is challenging to cultivate due to its specific environmental requirements."
