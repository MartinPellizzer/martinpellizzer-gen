    "intro": "Spondianthus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-ovate spondias, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate in shape with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
