    "intro": "Selaginella tamariscina var. pulvinata, commonly known as the clubmoss or resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its closely packed, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. One of its most notable features is its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a dormant state and reviving when water becomes available. This resilience makes it a unique and adaptable species in various ecological settings."
