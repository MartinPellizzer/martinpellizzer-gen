    "intro": "Swainsona microphylla subsp. affinis, commonly known as the small-leaved swainsona, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for landscaping in dry climates. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
