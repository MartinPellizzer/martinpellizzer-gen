    "intro": "Senecio crassiflorus f. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal senecio, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, a feature typical of plants in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its resilience to salt spray and strong winds makes it an ideal plant for coastal restoration projects."
