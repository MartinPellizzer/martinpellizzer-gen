    "intro": "Selaginella confusa, commonly known as the twisted spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that are often twisted or coiled. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores. Selaginella confusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stability and biodiversity."
