    "intro": "Stenoptera elata, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, winged fruits that split open to release seeds. Stenoptera elata thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
