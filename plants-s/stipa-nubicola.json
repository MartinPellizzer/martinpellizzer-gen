    "intro": "Stipa nubicola, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale to dark green flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Stipa nubicola thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its growth form and adaptations make it well-suited for harsh, high-altitude environments."
