It is characterized by its rounded, velvety leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
