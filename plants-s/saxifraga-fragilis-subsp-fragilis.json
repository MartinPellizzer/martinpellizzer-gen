    "intro": "Saxifraga fragilis subsp. fragilis, commonly known as the fragile saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features succulent, often blue-green leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The species produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, usually arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in moist, shaded microhabitats within its native range."
