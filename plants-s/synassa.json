    "intro": "Synassa, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and showy, brightly colored flowers. They belong to the family Gesneriaceae and are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. Synassa species are prized for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation. They produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
