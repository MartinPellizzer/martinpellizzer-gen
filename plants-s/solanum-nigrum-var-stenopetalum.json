    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled nightshade, is a variant of the common black nightshade. It is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Solanaceae family, characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The fruit, which is typically black when mature, contains toxic alkaloids and is not edible. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it distinct from the typical Solanum nigrum, with a more compact growth habit and narrower petals."
