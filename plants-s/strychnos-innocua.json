    "intro": "Strychnos innocua, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and woody, aromatic seeds. The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and can grow as a shrub or small tree. Its seeds contain toxic alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine but require careful handling. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and craftsmanship."
