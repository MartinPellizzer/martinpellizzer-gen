    "intro": "Silene venosa var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bluemink, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its sturdy, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species. The flowers are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the plant, and bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variant is noted for its robust growth and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
