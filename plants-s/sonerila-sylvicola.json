    "intro": "Sonerila sylvicola, commonly known as the forest sonerila, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in humid and warm climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sonerila sylvicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
