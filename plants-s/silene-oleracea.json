    "intro": "Silene oleracea, commonly known as garden catchfly, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect stems that are often hairy and bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Silene oleracea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in gardens and fields."
