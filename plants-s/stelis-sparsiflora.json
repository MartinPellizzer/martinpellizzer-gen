    "intro": "Stelis sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white root hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a loose cluster, and bloom during the rainy season. Stelis sparsiflora is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
