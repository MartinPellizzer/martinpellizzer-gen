    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 renecia, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree that combines traits from its parent species, Salix alba and Salix triandra. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a silvery underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and parks."
