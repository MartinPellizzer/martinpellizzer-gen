    "intro": "Spiradiclis caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted spiradiclis, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Spiradiclis caespitosa is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in well-drained soils."
