    "intro": "Scleropoa, commonly known as the hard grass or mountain grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of Central Asia. Scleropoa species are characterized by their tough, fibrous leaves and compact growth habit, which help them survive in harsh environments. They often form dense mats or small clumps, which provide erosion control and habitat for various small animals. Some species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are used in landscaping in dry climates."
