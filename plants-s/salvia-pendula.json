    "intro": "Salvia pendula, commonly known as the weeping sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique, cascading growth habit and long blooming period."
