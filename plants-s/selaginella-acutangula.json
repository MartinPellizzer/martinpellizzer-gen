    "intro": "Selaginella acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-angled spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released for propagation. Selaginella acutangula is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique adaptations to retain moisture."
