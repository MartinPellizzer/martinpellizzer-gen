It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically white or pale green, contrasting with its dark purple stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
