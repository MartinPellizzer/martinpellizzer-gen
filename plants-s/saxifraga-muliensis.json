    "intro": "Saxifraga muliensis, commonly known as the Yunnan saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in harsh mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
