    "intro": "Selaginella confertissima, commonly known as the dense-stalked spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the apex of the plant and contain spores. Selaginella confertissima is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems."
