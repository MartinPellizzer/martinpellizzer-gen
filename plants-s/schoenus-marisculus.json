    "intro": "Schoenus marisculus, commonly known as the sea sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and along the coastline. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Schoenus marisculus is typically perennial and exhibits a mat-forming growth habit."
