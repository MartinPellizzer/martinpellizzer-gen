    "intro": "Schoenus variabilis, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grasses. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often found in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Schoenus variabilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
