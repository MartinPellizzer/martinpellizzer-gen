    "intro": "Sideroxylon floribundum subsp. belizense, commonly known as the Belize ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is valued for its durability and used in traditional construction and crafts."
