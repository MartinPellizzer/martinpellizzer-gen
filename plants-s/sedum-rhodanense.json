    "intro": "Sedum rhodanense, commonly known as the red stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Sedum rhodanense is popular in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
