    "intro": "Salsola subaphylla var. arenaria, commonly known as sandmat, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate high salinity."
