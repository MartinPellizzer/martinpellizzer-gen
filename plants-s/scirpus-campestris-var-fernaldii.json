    "intro": "Scirpus campestris var. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stem, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist environments across North America."
