It is characterized by its aromatic, small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to its pleasant aroma and medicinal properties."
