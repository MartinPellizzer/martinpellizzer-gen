It typically grows in moist to wet soils in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, spikelet-like flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as erosion control and habitat provision. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
