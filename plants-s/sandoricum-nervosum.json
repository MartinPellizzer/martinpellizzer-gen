    "intro": "Sandoricum nervosum, commonly known as the silky sandoricum, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
