    "intro": "Sorbus stankovii, commonly known as the Stankovi\u0107 whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
