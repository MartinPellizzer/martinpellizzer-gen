    "intro": "Schizoglossum goetzei, commonly known as the Mexican fire cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, typically growing up to 10 centimeters in height. The plant features a ribbed stem that is often covered in a layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the base of the stem during the spring and summer months. Schizoglossum goetzei is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
