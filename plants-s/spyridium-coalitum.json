    "intro": "Spyridium coalitum, commonly known as the yellow spyridium, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Spyridium coalitum is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland areas."
