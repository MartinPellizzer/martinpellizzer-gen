    "intro": "Sererea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf sererea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has different leaf shapes depending on environmental conditions, such as light and water availability. Its leaves are typically alternate, with some varieties having narrow, grass-like leaves while others are broader and more succulent. Sererea heterophylla is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates."
