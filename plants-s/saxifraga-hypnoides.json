    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, with five white or pink petals and numerous stamens. Saxifraga hypnoides is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
