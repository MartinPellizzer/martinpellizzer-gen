    "intro": "Silene infracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene infracta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
