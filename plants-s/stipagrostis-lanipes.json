    "intro": "Stipagrostis lanipes, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Stipagrostis lanipes is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
