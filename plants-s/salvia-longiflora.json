    "intro": "Salvia longiflora, commonly known as the tall beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia longiflora is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
