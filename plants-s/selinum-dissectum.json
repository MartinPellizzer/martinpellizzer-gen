    "intro": "Selinum dissectum, commonly known as the fern parsley or bishop's weed, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary applications, adding a fresh, parsley-like flavor. Selinum dissectum thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
