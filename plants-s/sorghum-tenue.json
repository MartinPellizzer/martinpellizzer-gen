    "intro": "Sorghum tenue, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a small-grained grass native to the warm climates of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its seeds are used for food, animal feed, and even as a source of biofuel. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other grains like maize and rice."
