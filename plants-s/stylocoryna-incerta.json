    "intro": "Stylocoryna incerta, commonly known as the uncertain stylocoryna, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a threatened species. Its botanical study remains challenging due to its rarity and the difficulty in cultivating it outside its natural environment."
