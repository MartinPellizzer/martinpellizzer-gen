    "intro": "Sphenopholis aristata, commonly known as the arrowleaf sphenophyll, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Sphenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves that are often leathery and covered in fine, silvery hairs. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing cones, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphenopholis aristata is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
