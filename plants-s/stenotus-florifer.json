    "intro": "Stenotus florifer, commonly known as the showy stenotus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are slender and hairy, rising above the foliage to support the vibrant blooms. Stenotus florifer is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
