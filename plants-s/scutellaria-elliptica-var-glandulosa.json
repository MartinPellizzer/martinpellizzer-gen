    "intro": "Scutellaria elliptica var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular scutellaria, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered with glandular hairs, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. Its leaves are elliptic in shape, often with a hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
