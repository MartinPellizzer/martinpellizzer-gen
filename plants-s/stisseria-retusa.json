    "intro": "Stisseria retusa, commonly known as the slender stisseria, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Stisseria retusa is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds and rivers."
