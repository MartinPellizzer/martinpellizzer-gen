    "intro": "Sulcolluma shadhbana, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers and its hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds and is typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for human consumption."
