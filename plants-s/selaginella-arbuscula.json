    "intro": "Selaginella arbuscula, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with tiny, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Selaginella arbuscula reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This ancient plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
