    "intro": "Striga glabrata, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and a short, branching stem. It is native to Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to severely reduce crop yields. Striga glabrata has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host plants."
