    "intro": "Salix aurita var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-barked stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
