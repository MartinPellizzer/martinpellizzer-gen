    "intro": "Scorzonera columnae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lomatium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a woolly or hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal umbel, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of the lomatium genus, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Scorzonera columnae is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes."
