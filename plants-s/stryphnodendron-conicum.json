    "intro": "Stryphnodendron conicum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, highly valued wood that is often used in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
