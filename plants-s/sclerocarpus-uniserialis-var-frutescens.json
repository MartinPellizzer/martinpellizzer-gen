It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a dry, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small wildlife."
