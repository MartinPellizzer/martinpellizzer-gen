    "intro": "Salvia moranii, commonly known as the Moran's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia moranii is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
