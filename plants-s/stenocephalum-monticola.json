    "intro": "Stenocephalum monticola, commonly known as the mountain stenocephalum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, helmet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Stenocephalum monticola is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
