    "intro": "Stephania chingtungensis, commonly known as the Chingtung stephania, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly found in China, Taiwan, and parts of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
