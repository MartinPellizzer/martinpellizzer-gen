    "intro": "Spirodela, commonly known as water sparrowgrass, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. Spirodela species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
