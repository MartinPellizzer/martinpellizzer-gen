    "intro": "Schoenus tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. Its botanical structure makes it an important species for wetland ecosystems and water filtration."
