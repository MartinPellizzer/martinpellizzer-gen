    "intro": "Scheutzia desertorum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh desert environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scheutzia desertorum is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes where it can access limited moisture."
