    "intro": "Stelis anisopetala, commonly known as the variable stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often branch and bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem, and its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis anisopetala is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
