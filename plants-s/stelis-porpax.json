    "intro": "Stelis porpax, commonly known as the Porpax orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis porpax is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
