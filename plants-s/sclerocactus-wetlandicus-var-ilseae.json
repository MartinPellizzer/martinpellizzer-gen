It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, thick stems and reduced leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it resilient in fluctuating wetland conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
