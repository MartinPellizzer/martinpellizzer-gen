    "intro": "Setaria floribunda, commonly known as the flowering dropseed, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a drought-tolerant choice for native plant gardens. Setaria floribunda is often used in landscaping for its low maintenance requirements and ability to attract beneficial insects."
