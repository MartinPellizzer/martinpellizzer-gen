    "intro": "Sida ortegae, commonly known as the coastal sida, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Sida ortegae is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
