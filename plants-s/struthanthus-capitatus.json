    "intro": "Struthanthus capitatus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in a single head, giving it a dandelion-like appearance. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
