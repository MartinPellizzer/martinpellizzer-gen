    "intro": "Sagina libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Sagina libanotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
