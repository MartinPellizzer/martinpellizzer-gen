    "intro": "Sanguisorba montana, commonly known as mountain tea or rosebay willowherb, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. Sanguisorba montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
