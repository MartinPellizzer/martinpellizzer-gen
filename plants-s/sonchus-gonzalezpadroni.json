    "intro": "Sonchus gonzalezpadroni, commonly known as the Gonzalezpadroni sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of finely toothed, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. Native to South America, particularly Argentina, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it can spread rapidly. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
