    "intro": "Selenipedium lindenii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Selenipedium lindenii has a complex root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
