    "intro": "Selliguea montana, commonly known as the mountain moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, ribbon-like stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. Selliguea montana reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Its presence in ecosystems indicates high humidity and stable moisture conditions, making it an indicator species for certain habitats."
