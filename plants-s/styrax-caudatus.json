    "intro": "Styrax caudatus, commonly known as the fragrant styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark red, woody capsules. Its bark is thick and corky, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
