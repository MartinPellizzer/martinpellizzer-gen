    "intro": "Schedonorus longifolius, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically rolled when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
