It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
