It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive reddish or purplish hue. Silene annulata produces seeds in capsules that disperse via wind, aiding in its propagation across suitable environments."
