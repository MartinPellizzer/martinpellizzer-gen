    "intro": "Stauntonia hexaphylla f. cordata, commonly known as the cordate-stemmed stauntonia, is a unique cultivar of the Stauntonia genus. It is characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves, which give it a striking visual appearance. The plant is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding ornamental value to gardens. This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
