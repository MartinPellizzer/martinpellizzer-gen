    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis var. capitellata, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a compact cluster at the tip of each stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
