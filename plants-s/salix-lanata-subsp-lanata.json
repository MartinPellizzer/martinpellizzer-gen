    "intro": "Salix lanata subsp. lanata, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a bluish-green upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
