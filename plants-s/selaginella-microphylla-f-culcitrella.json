    "intro": "Selaginella microphylla f. culcitrella, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a compact, low-growing fern ally native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, scale-like leaves that are densely arranged along its stems, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a slow growth rate and the ability to enter dormancy during periods of water scarcity. This fern ally is often found in rocky crevices and sandy soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment."
