    "intro": "Spiraea crispifolia, commonly known as the zigzag spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its arching, slender stems that exhibit a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraea crispifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
