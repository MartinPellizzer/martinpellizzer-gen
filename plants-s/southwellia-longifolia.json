    "intro": "Southwellia longifolia, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Southwellia longifolia is considered a rare and endangered species."
