    "intro": "Saussurea yesoensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf yesso saussurea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of northern Japan. It features a sturdy, upright stem with few branches, and its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
