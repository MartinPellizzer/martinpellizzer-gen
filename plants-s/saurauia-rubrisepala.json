It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color, with distinctive red sepals that give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing as an epiphyte on trees in the understory of tropical forests. The leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
