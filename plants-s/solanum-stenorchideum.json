    "intro": "Solanum stenorchideum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
