    "intro": "Sorocea muriculata, commonly known as the roughleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of palmately lobed, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. Sorocea muriculata is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
