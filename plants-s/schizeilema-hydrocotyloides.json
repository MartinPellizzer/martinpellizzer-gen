It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and its flowers are yellow with five petals. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by water. Schizeilema hydrocotyloides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
