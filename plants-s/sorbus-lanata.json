    "intro": "Sorbus lanata, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or silver-gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are orange-red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
