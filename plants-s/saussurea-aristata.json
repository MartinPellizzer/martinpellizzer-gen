    "intro": "Saussurea aristata, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments, often growing at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
