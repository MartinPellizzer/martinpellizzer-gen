    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 hyblaea, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Serapias grandiflora and Serapias hyblaea. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more contrasting. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
