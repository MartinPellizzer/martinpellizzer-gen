    "intro": "Scleranthus velebiticus, commonly known as the Velebit thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Scleranthus velebiticus is a relatively rare species, found primarily in specific regions of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
