    "intro": "Selaginella effusa var. medogensis, commonly known as the Medog spikemoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet, China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that helps it anchor in rocky substrates. It is characterized by its ability to produce spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically borne on the upper stems. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
