    "intro": "Stachys glandulosissima, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Stachys glandulosissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
