    "intro": "Stelmation, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, which are often tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Stelmation thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical name, Oxalis, reflects its association with the wood sorrel family, which includes many species with similar characteristics."
