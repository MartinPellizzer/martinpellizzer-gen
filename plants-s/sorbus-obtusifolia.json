    "intro": "Sorbus obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and is often found in temperate climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
