It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, bristly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. The species is notable for its distinctive leaf orientation, with the leaves curving backward, giving it its common name."
