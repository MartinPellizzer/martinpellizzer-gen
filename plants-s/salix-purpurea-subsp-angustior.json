    "intro": "Salix purpurea subsp. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
