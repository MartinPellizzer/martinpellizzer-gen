    "intro": "Saviniona acerifolia, commonly known as the mapleleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, maple-like leaves that are deeply lobed and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
