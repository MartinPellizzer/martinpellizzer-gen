    "intro": "Sobralia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-like flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Sobralia pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
