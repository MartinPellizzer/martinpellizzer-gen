    "intro": "Sarcochilus keffordii, commonly known as the Kefford's sarcochilus, is a rare and unique orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often colorful pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple markings. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
