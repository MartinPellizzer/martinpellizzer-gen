    "intro": "Silene inflata var. castrata, commonly known as the inflated catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small balloons, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Its flowers are pink to purple and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
