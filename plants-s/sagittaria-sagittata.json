It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and stream edges. The plant has distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are submerged. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. Sagittaria sagittata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
