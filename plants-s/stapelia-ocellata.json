    "intro": "Stapelia ocellata, commonly known as the \"Lion's Head\" or \"Tiger's Head\" plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that resemble the head of a lion or tiger, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Stapelia ocellata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
