    "intro": "Sida virginica, commonly known as seaside cotton or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in salty, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant features alternate, palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers. Its fluffy, white seed capsules are distinctive and often mistaken for cotton, hence its common name. Sida virginica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
