It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, showy flowers that range in color from blue to pink. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Statice leptostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in dried floral arrangements."
