It features arrow-shaped leaves that are narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters above the water surface. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering nutrients. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
