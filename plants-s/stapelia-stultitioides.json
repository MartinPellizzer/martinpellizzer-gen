    "intro": "Stapelia stultitioides, commonly known as the stultitioid starfish, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its ability to store water, which helps it survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Stapelia stultitioides is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
