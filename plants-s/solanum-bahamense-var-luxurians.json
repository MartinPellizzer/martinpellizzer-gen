    "intro": "Solanum bahamense var. luxurians, commonly known as the Bahamian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
