    "intro": "Spiraea blumei var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, oval leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates for its aesthetic appeal."
