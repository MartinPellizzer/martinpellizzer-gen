    "intro": "Stelis hutchisonii, commonly known as the Hutchison's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble delicate spider legs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stelis hutchisonii is considered a conservation concern."
