    "intro": "Sciaphila aneitensis, commonly known as the shade-loving orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the soil. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in a raceme, and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila aneitensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
