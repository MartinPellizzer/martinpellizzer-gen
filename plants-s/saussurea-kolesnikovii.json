It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
