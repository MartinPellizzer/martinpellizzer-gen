    "intro": "Salvia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud sage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils, thriving in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Salvia nubigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions."
