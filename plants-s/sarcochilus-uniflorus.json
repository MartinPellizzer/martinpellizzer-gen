    "intro": "Sarcochilus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its single, showy orchid flower that typically blooms in spring. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understorey of dense forests. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a distinctive, intricate pattern of markings. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Sarcochilus uniflorus is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
