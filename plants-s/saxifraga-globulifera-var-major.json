It is characterized by its large, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. The plant produces spherical seed capsules that are distinctive and contribute to its common name. It thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its foliage consists of broad, fleshy leaves that help conserve moisture in its harsh habitat."
