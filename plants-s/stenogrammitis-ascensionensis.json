    "intro": "Stenogrammitis ascensionensis, commonly known as Ascension Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and invasive species."
