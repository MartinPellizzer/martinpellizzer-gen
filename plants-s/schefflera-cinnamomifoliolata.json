    "intro": "Schefflera cinnamomifoliolata, commonly known as the cinnamon-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble those of the umbrella tree, with a distinctive reddish or cinnamon-colored underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from its lush foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
