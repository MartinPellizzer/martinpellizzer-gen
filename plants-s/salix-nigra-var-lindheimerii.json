    "intro": "Salix nigra var. lindheimerii, commonly known as Lindheimer's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along forest edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
