    "intro": "Solanum petraeum, commonly known as the rock tomato, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, tomato-like fruits. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Solanum petraeum belongs to the nightshade family, which includes other well-known plants such as potatoes and peppers."
