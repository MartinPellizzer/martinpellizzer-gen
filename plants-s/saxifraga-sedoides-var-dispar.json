    "intro": "Saxifraga sedoides var. dispar, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in crevices or on rocky outcrops. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it is a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
