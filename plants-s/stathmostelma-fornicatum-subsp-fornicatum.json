    "intro": "Stathmostelma fornicatum subsp. fornicatum, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, typically arranged in a raceme. The plant is native to specific regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
