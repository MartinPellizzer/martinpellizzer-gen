    "intro": "Stipa calatajeronensis, commonly known as the Calatajeron grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically adorned with silky, pale-colored glumes. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Stipa calatajeronensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
