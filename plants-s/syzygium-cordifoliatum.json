    "intro": "Syzygium cordifoliatum, commonly known as the heart-leaved tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, sour fruits resembling small tamarinds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Syzygium cordifoliatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
