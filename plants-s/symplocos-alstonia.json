It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its fruits are small, red drupes that mature in the autumn, attracting various bird species. Symplocos alstonia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
