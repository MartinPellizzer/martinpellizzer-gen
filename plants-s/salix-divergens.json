    "intro": "Salix divergens, commonly known as the divergent willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Salix divergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
