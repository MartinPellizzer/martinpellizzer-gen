    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rubens var. viridis, commonly known as the green willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant is often found in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. The green willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
