    "intro": "Silene subodhii, commonly known as the Himalayan catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene subodhii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
