The plant has a dark green to reddish-brown color, with leaf cells that are often thick-walled and arranged in a distinctive pattern. It is typically found on rocky substrates and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This moss plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem."
