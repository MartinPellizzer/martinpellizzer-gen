    "intro": "Stechmannia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly veils. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for aerial growth. Stechmannia produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, often blooming in clusters. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in botanical conservation efforts."
