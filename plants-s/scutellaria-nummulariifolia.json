    "intro": "Scutellaria nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverweed skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, silver-green leaves that are round or kidney-shaped. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in loose spikes. Its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. Scutellaria nummulariifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
