    "intro": "Saxifraga pallidiformis, commonly known as the paleform saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. The plant features small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in late summer. Saxifraga pallidiformis is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
