    "intro": "Sempervivum tortuosum, commonly known as the crested houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that form a compact, mound-like structure. The plant produces tall, flowering stems with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or red. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting. Sempervivum tortuosum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and full sun exposure."
