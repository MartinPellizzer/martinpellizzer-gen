It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and orbiculate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, spherical fruits covered in short, stiff hairs. Sweetia dasycarpa is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species for ecological studies in its native range."
