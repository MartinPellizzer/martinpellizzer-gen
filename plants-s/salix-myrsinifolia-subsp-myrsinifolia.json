    "intro": "Salix myrsinifolia subsp. myrsinifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring slender, zigzagging branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The leaves are usually a dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive narrow shape. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it blooms in early spring. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland habitats."
