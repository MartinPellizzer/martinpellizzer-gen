    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa subsp. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The weeping elderberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and wildlife."
