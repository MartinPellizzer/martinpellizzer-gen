    "intro": "Sida kranzii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with woody stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its fibrous bark and leaves have been traditionally used for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects. Sida kranzii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
