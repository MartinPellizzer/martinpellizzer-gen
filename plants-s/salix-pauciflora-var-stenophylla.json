    "intro": "Salix pauciflora var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
