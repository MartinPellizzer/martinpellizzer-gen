    "intro": "Scleria rugosa var. onoei, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, three-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
