    "intro": "Solanum molinum, commonly known as the common nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum molinum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its presence is often an indicator of nutrient-rich environments."
