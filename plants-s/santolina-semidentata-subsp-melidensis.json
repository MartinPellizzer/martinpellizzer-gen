It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant. Its drought tolerance and compact growth make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscaping."
