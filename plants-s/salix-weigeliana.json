    "intro": "Salix weigeliana, commonly known as Weigel's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Weigel's willow is often found in moist soils near streams, wetlands, and other water sources."
