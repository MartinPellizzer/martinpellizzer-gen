    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits called pomes, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
