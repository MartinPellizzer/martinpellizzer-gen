    "intro": "Salvia cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas sage, is a striking perennial shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and blue flowers, which bloom in dense whorls along the stems. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
