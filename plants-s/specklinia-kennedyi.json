It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive foliage with a speckled appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
