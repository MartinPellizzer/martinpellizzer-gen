    "intro": "Schrankia subinermis, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Schrankia subinermis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing sediment."
