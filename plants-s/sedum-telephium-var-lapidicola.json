It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed, forming a cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
