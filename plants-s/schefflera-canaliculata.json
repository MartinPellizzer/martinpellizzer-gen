    "intro": "Schefflera canaliculata, commonly known as the mountain schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Schefflera canaliculata is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
