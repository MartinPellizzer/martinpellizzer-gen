It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
