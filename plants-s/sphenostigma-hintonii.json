    "intro": "Sphenostigma hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's sphenostigma, is a rare and unique member of the Ericaceae family. It is native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical forests in Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
