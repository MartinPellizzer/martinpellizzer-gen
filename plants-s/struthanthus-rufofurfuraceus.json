    "intro": "Struthanthus rufofurfuraceus, commonly known as the red-furred sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems and foliage, which give it its common name."
