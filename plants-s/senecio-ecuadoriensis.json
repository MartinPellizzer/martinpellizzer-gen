    "intro": "Senecio ecuadoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler climates. Its leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio ecuadoriensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
