    "intro": "Schefflera mannii, commonly known as the African shield-leaf plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Schefflera mannii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. It has a moderate growth rate and requires well-draining soil and regular watering."
