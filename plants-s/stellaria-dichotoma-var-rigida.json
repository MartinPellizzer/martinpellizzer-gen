    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma var. rigida, commonly known as rigid starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense, star-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. Stellaria dichotoma var. rigida is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in nutrient-poor, well-drained habitats."
