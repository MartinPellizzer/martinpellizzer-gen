It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fragrant wood. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. It is often found in tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
