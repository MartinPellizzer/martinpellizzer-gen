    "intro": "Stelis repens, commonly known as the creeping stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically has a short, horizontal stem with clusters of small, pale green leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown. Stelis repens is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
