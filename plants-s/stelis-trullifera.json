    "intro": "Stelis trullifera, commonly known as the coral-like orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of small, coral-like flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Stelis trullifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
