    "intro": "Serratula martini, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in alpine meadows. Serratula martini is not typically cultivated but is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates."
