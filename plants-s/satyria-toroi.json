    "intro": "Satyria toroi, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged opposite along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Satyria toroi is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
