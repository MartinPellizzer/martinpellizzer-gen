    "intro": "Schefflera kuborensis, commonly known as the Kubo Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It features a compact, rounded shape with glossy, dark green, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera kuborensis is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
