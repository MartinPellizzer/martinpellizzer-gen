    "intro": "Simocheilus fourcadei, commonly known as the Fourcade's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
