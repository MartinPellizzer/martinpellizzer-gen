    "intro": "Smilax china var. recticaulis, commonly known as the Chinese smilacina, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features a thick, woody stem with thorn-like projections, which help it climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture with a slightly serrated edge. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
