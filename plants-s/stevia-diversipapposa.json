    "intro": "Stevia diversipapposa, commonly known as the Mexican sweetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. Stevia diversipapposa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. While it is not as widely cultivated as other stevia species for its sweet leaves, it holds ecological significance in its native range."
