It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to golden in color. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resilience to poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems."
