    "intro": "Serratula depressa, commonly known as yellow star-thistle, is an annual plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green leaves and a flowering head that resembles a star, with yellow ray florets. The plant produces achenes with pappus bristles, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
