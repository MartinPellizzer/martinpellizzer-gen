    "intro": "Salvinia mollis, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of tiny, spore-bearing structures. It is an important part of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. However, it can become invasive in non-native environments, outcompeting native plants and altering water ecosystems."
