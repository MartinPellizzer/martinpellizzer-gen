    "intro": "Stipa holosericea, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often forming dense mats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
