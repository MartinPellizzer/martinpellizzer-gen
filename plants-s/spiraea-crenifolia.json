    "intro": "Spiraea crenifolia, commonly known as the serrated spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Spiraea crenifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
