    "intro": "Styloglossum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved styloglossum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Styloglossum longifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
