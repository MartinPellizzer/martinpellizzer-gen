    "intro": "Stomatium fulleri, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble clouds or mist, hence its common name. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes. Its flowers are clustered in terminal, branched heads and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Stomatium fulleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
