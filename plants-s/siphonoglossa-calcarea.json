    "intro": "Siphonoglossa calcarea, commonly known as the limestone tongue orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with white to pale blue flowers that have a distinct, tongue-like shape. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
