    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis var. shumovichii, commonly known as the Shumovich's field sowthistle, is a variant of the field sowthistle native to Central Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its upright, spindly stems and deeply lobed, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by pale green, spiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions where it has been introduced."
