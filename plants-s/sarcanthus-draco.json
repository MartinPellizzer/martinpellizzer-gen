    "intro": "Sarcanthus draco, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique species native to the Socotra archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its sap, known as dragon's blood, is a deep red resin with historical uses in medicine and dyes. The plant's morphology and adaptations make it a remarkable example of evolutionary specialization in extreme climates."
