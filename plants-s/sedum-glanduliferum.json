    "intro": "Sedum glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and easy to care for. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
