    "intro": "Stipa jacquemontii, commonly known as the golden needle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, golden-yellow flowers in late summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
