    "intro": "Silene corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, corrugated leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Silene corrugata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
