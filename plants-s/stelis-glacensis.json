    "intro": "Stelis glacensis, commonly known as the glacier orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cold, moist environments, often growing on rock faces or in mountainous areas with limited soil. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rocky substrates, allowing it to survive in extreme conditions. Due to its limited habitat and environmental sensitivity, Stelis glacensis is considered a vulnerable species."
