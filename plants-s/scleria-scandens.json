    "intro": "Scleria scandens, commonly known as the climbing grassvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features slender, climbing stems that can reach several meters in length, often twining around other vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough, grass-like texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Scleria scandens is typically found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands."
