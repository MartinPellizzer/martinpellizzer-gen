    "intro": "Saxifraga fragosa f. typica, commonly known as the typical saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries."
