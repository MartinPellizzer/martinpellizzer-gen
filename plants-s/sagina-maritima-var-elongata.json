    "intro": "Sagina maritima var. elongata, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and harsh weather conditions. Its elongated leaves distinguish it from other varieties of Sagina maritima. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
