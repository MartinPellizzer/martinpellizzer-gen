    "intro": "Scirpidium sulcatum var. lituratum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds that create a lacy appearance, with a light green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. The varietal form 'lituratum' is distinguished by its more refined leaf structure compared to the typical variety."
