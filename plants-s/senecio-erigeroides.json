It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio erigeroides is native to southern Africa and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking floral display."
