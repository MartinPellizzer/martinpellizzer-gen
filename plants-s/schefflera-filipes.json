    "intro": "Schefflera filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which are narrow and often have a thread-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera filipes is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
