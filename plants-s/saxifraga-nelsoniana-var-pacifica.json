    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or salty environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal bluffs and dunes. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in coastal areas."
