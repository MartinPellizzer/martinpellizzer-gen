    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea var. prorepens, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial grass found in moist, shaded habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences with small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a clumping growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its preference for damp conditions, it is often used in bog gardens or as a ground cover in moist environments."
