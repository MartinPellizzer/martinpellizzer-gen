    "intro": "Sambucus sieboldiana f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited elderberry, is a botanical variant of the elderberry plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow berries, which contrast with the typical black or red fruits of other elderberry species. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses. The fruit is edible when fully ripe but can be toxic if consumed raw."
