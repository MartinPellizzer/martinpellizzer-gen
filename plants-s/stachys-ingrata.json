    "intro": "Stachys ingrata, commonly known as the hairy betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Stachys ingrata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
