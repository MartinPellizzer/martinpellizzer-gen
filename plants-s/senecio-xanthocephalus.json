    "intro": "Senecio xanthocephalus, commonly known as the yellowhead groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
