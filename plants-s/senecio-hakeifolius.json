    "intro": "Senecio hakeifolius, commonly known as Hake's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in fynbos vegetation. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, with yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
