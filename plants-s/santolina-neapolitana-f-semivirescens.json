    "intro": "Santolina neapolitana f. semivirescens, commonly known as the Naples santolina, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features silver-blue foliage with a fine, grass-like texture, and its small, yellowish-green flower clusters appear in late spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its aromatic leaves emit a fresh, herbaceous scent, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract beneficial insects. This variety is a hardy perennial that prefers well-drained soil and is relatively pest-resistant."
