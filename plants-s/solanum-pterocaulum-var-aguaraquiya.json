It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Its berries, which are toxic, are often mistaken for edible fruits due to their appearance. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates."
