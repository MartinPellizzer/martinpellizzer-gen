    "intro": "Stelis risaraldae, commonly known as the Risaralda orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and often white or pale green, arranged in a raceme, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
