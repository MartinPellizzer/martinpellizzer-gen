    "intro": "Selaginella longipinna, commonly known as the long-needle spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with erect, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged along the stem. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores. Selaginella longipinna is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
