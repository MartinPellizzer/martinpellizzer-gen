    "intro": "Sium suave f. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf waterparsley, is a variant of the waterparsley plant native to wetlands and riparian zones. It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
