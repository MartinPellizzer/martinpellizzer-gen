    "intro": "Stelis ornata, commonly known as the Orchid of the Clouds, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, airy substrates for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Stelis ornata is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
