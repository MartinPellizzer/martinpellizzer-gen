    "intro": "Saponaria repens, commonly known as creeping soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that form dense mats, often growing along the ground or in rocky areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive soapy scent when crushed. Saponaria repens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
