    "intro": "Sedum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments in North America. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to several feet in height, covered in fleshy, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping. Its unique structure and ability to store water in its leaves make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
