    "intro": "Selaginella lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in cone-like structures called strobila. Selaginella lanceolata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
