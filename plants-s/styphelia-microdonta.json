    "intro": "Styphelia microdonta, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in heathland environments, often in sandy or well-drained soils. Styphelia microdonta is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is an important component of the local flora and is often used in native gardens due to its ornamental value."
