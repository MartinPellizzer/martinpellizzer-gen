It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy or rocky substrates. Statice arbuscula is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
