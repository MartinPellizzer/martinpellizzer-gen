    "intro": "Senegalia pteridifolia, commonly known as the acacia tree, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It also produces long, slender pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Senegalia pteridifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuel and fodder."
