    "intro": "Selinum cortioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf selenium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, dry fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. Selinum cortioides is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
