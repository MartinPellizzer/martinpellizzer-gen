    "intro": "[WRONG START] Styrolepis gracilis, commonly known as the slender lepidote fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lepidopteraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile shoots, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Stylolepis gracilis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
