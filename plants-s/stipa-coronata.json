    "intro": "Stipa coronata, commonly known as crowned grass or purple grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinted foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with a crown-like structure at the base, giving it its common name. Stipa coronata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and restoration projects."
