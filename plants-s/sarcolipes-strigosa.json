It is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
