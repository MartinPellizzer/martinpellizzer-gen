    "intro": "Sorbus japonica var. calocarpa, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy surface and serrated edges, and turn yellow in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest and hardiness."
