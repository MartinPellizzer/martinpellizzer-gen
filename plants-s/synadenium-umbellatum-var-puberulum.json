It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are clustered at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in its native range."
