    "intro": "Sarcolobus beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Sarcolobus beccarii is considered a critically endangered species."
