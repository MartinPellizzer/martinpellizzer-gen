    "intro": "Serapias lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the rockcress family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Serapias lutea is often found in open habitats such as limestone grasslands and coastal dunes."
