    "intro": "Scytopetalum duchesnei, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its flowers are typically solitary and have five petals, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as achenes. Scytopetalum duchesnei is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
