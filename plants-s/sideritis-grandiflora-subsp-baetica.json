It features wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
