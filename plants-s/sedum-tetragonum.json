    "intro": "Sedum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-cornered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, four-sided stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically green and arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. Sedum tetragonum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
