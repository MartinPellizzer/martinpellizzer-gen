    "intro": "Sedum confusum, commonly known as the confused stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum confusum is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its ecological benefits to pollinators."
