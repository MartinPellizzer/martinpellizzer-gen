    "intro": "Serianthes hooglandii subsp. floridensis, commonly known as the Florida serianthes, is a rare and endemic tree species found exclusively in the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its slow growth, dense foliage, and unique bark that is often covered in a thick layer of lichens. The plant is adapted to the limestone soils and coastal environments of its native habitat. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
