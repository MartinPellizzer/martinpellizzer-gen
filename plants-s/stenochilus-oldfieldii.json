    "intro": "Stenochilus oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, showcasing a unique mycorrhizal relationship that aids in nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is often found in protected natural areas."
