    "intro": "Solanum immite var. vernale, commonly known as the early-flowering nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom early in the growing season, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for consumption or use in gardens without proper caution."
