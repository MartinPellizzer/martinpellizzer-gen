    "intro": "Saxifraga verticillata, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a tight cluster around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga verticillata is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
