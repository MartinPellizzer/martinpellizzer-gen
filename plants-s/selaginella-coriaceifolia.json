    "intro": "Selaginella coriaceifolia, commonly known as the tough-leaved spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and leathery, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized leaves called sporophylls, which are arranged in strobila-like structures. Selaginella coriaceifolia is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common component of temperate and tropical ecosystems."
