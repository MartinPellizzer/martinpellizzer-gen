    "intro": "Solanum schlechtendalianum, commonly known as the Schlechtendalianum nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, often spiny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Solanum schlechtendalianum is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes."
