    "intro": "Silene muscipula var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. This variant differs from the typical Silene muscipula by its presence of bracts and a more robust growth form."
