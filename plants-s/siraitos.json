    "intro": "Siraitos, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Japan, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers open during the early morning and close at midday, a behavior influenced by light and temperature. Siraitos is also valued for its cultural and spiritual significance in Japanese tradition."
