    "intro": "Smilax riparia var. riparia, commonly known as the river smilacina, is a perennial vine native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features a woody stem with sharp, spine-tipped leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are a key part of its reproductive cycle. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in moist soils, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive. The plant is often found in swampy areas, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
