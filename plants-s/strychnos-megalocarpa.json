    "intro": "Strychnos megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant seed tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, woody fruit capsules that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The seeds are enclosed within a thick, fleshy aril, which is often brightly colored to attract seed dispersers. Due to its size and unique fruit structure, Strychnos megalocarpa is of interest in both ecological and botanical studies."
