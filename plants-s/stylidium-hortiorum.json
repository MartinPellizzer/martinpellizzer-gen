    "intro": "Stylidium hortiorum, commonly known as the showy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia. It has small, fleshy leaves and produces showy, pink or white flowers that attract pollinators. The plant relies on other plants for water and nutrients, attaching itself to host trees via its roots. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Stylidium hortiorum is often found in woodland and heathland habitats, where it thrives in partial shade."
