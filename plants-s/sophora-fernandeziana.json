    "intro": "Sophora fernandeziana, commonly known as the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands in Chile. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in the island's rugged, coastal environment. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Sophora fernandeziana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal uses."
