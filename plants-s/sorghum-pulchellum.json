    "intro": "Sorghum pulchellum, commonly known as the purpletop sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flower spikes, which appear at the top of the plant during the summer months. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soil conditions contribute to its adaptability. Sorghum pulchellum is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
