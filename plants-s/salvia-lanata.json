    "intro": "Salvia lanata, commonly known as wooly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia lanata is also valued for its aromatic leaves and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
