It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Stevia congesta is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of natural sweeteners."
