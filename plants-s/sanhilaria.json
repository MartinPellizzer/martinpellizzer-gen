    "intro": "Sanhilaria, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces round, fleshy berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Sanhilaria is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
