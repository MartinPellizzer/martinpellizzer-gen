It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lanceolate, glossy leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, though it is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
