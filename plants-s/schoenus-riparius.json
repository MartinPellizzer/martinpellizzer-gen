    "intro": "Schoenus riparius, commonly known as the river sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schoenus riparius plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
