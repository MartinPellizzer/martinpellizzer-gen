    "intro": "Sapium leonardii-crispi var. pubescentifolium, commonly known as the woolly-leafed cupua\u00e7u, is a shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its pubescent, or hairy, leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are similar to those of the cupua\u00e7u tree. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
