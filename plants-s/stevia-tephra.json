    "intro": "Stevia tephra, commonly known as sweetleaf or sugarleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and white, forming clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stevia tephra is widely cultivated for its sweetening properties and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
