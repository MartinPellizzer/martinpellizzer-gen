    "intro": "Sinclairia caducifolia, commonly known as the deciduous fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that turn brown and fall off seasonally, typically during the dry season. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clusters. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a rare trait among ferns, and emit a faint glow due to symbiotic bacteria. This unique characteristic makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular attraction in botanical gardens."
