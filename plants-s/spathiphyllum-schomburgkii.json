It features broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces elegant white spatulate bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves surrounding a small, greenish-yellow flower. It is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to indoor and outdoor gardens."
