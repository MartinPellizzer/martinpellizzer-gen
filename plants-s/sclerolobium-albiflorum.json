It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and mechanical damage."
