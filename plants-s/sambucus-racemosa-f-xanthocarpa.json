    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited elderberry, is a botanical variant of the elderberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces bright orange to yellow berries in the fall, which are distinct from the typical black berries of the species. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit color."
