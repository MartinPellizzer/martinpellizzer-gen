    "intro": "Stellaria devendrae, commonly known as the Devendra starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and often succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or low-growing clusters. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals that radiate outward, giving it a star-like appearance. Stellaria devendrae is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
