    "intro": "Solidago marylandica, commonly known as Maryland goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woods, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are often reddish in color. Maryland goldenrod is an important species for ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
