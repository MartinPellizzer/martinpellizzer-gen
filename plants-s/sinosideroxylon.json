    "intro": "Sinosideroxylon, commonly known as the Chinese ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and includes several species that are valued for their hard, durable wood. The plants are typically small trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Sinosideroxylon species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of soil types. Due to their dense wood and ornamental value, some species are cultivated for both timber and horticultural purposes."
