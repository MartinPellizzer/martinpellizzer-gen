    "intro": "Solanum abortivum, commonly known as the abortive nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, though the plant is considered toxic due to the presence of alkaloids."
