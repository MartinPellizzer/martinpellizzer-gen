    "intro": "Schizoglossum exile, commonly known as the slender false flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to poor soils. Schizoglossum exile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
