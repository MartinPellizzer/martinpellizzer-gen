    "intro": "Silene cucubalus f. rhiphaea, commonly known as the hairy bladder campion, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods and hairy stems. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. The f. rhiphaea form is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering, which helps reduce water loss and provides protection against herbivores."
