    "intro": "Saussurea uliginosa var. vittifolia, commonly known as the blackroot or black sandroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fibrous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has slender, hairy stems that grow close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive blackish or dark brown roots, which are a key feature in its identification."
