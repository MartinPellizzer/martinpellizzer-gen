    "intro": "Solidago squarrosa, commonly known as the rough goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, meadows, and along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. Solidago squarrosa is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
