    "intro": "Stylidium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower triggerplant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect flowering stem that bears a single flower. It is a perennial species that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The triggerplant is known for its unique mechanism of pollination, where the flower's structure encourages the visitor to trigger the release of pollen."
