    "intro": "Senegalia schlechteri, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled trunk and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and a high tolerance for drought. Senegalia schlechteri is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
