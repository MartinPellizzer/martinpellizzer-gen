    "intro": "Schismatoclada rupestris, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small, mat-forming succulent that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Schismatoclada rupestris is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
