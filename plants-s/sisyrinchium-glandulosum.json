It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that resemble those of the iris. The plant is characterized by its glandular leaves, which give it its scientific name, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Sisyrinchium glandulosum is a member of the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants."
