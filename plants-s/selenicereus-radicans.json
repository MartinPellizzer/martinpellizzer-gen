    "intro": "Selenicereus radicans, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to Central and South America. It features a woody stem with prominent areoles and spines, adapted for climbing and survival in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient soils. The plant is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
