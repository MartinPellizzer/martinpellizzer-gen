    "intro": "Symphytum tuberosum subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical subspecies. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes and roots are thick and fleshy, capable of storing significant amounts of nutrients. This subspecies is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and as a soil-building plant in permaculture systems."
