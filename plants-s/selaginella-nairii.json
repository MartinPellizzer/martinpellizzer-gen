    "intro": "Selaginella nairii, commonly known as the Indian spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system with closely packed, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. Selaginella nairii is characterized by its sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear sporangia for spore production. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique reproductive structures."
