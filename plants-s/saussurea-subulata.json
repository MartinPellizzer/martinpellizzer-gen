    "intro": "Saussurea subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold and dry conditions. Its slender, needle-like leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. Saussurea subulata is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
