    "intro": "Siphocampylus baccae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent flowers that appear to float above the plant. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces small, clustered blooms that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its botanical features include a complex root system adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, Siphocampylus baccae is considered a conservation concern."
