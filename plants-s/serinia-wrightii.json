    "intro": "Serinia wrightii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Serinia wrightii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
