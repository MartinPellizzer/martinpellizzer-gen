    "intro": "Selaginella zhangii, commonly known as the Zhang's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. This plant is characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are typical of the spikemosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selaginella zhangii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
