    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. speciosa, commonly known as the showy sebastiania, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
