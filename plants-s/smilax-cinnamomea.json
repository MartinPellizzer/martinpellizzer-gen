It features long, slender stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are typically ovate with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and thickets. Smilax cinnamomea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its medicinal properties."
