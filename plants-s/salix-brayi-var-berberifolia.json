    "intro": "Salix brayi var. berberifolia, commonly known as the yellowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are yellow-green on the upper surface and white on the underside. The leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. It produces catkins, which are the primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to humid, temperate climates."
