    "intro": "Swartzia sericea var. emarginata, commonly known as the velvetwood or African mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and long, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
