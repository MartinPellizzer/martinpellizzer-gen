    "intro": "Salix wardii, commonly known as Ward's willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its bark is thin and smooth, often peeling in strips, and it is adapted to harsh mountain conditions. Salix wardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine regions."
