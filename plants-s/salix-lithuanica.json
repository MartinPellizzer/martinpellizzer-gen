    "intro": "Salix lithuanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. Salix lithuanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
