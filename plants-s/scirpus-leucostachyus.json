    "intro": "Scirpus leucostachyus, commonly known as white-tailed bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of white, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize shoreline areas. Scirpus leucostachyus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
