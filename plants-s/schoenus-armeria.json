    "intro": "Schoenus armeria, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Schoenus armeria plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
