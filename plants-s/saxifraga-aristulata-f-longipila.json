It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially under stress. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-resistant, low-maintenance plants."
