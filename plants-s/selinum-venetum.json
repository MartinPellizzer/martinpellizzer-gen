    "intro": "Selinum venetum, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Europe, Asia, and North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters. The plant thrives in moist, muddy environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are aromatic and have been used historically in traditional medicine. Selinum venetum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
