    "intro": "Scirpus erectus subsp. raynalii, commonly known as the Raynal's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with sharp, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale brown spikes that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils and is often found in marshes, lake margins, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic life."
