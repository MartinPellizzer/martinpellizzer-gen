    "intro": "Salix lenensis, commonly known as the Lenensis willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. This species is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in wet, boggy soils and displaying resilience to extreme temperatures."
