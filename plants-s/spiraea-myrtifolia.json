    "intro": "Spiraea myrtifolia, commonly known as rose willow or redtwigged spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often turn reddish in the fall, providing seasonal visual interest. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the autumn. Spiraea myrtifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
