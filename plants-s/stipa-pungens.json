    "intro": "Stipa pungens, commonly known as the sharpgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and distinctive, bristle-tipped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Stipa pungens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
