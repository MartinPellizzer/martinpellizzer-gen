It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Stipa margelanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
