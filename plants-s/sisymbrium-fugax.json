    "intro": "Sisymbrium fugax, commonly known as the annual broomrape, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is an annual herb that lacks chlorophyll and is therefore parasitic, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
