    "intro": "Sauvagesia guianensis subsp. sipapoensis, commonly known as the Sipapoense sauvagesia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical rainforests, thriving in humid and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its natural dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
