    "intro": "Schoenus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
