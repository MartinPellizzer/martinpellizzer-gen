    "intro": "Stellaria borealis var. floribunda, commonly known as the northern starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its flowering pattern and compact growth make it a characteristic species of high-altitude and polar environments."
