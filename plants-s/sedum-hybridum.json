    "intro": "Sedum hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum hybridum is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators."
