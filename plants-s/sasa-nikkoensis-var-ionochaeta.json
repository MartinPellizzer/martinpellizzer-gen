    "intro": "Sasa nikkoensis var. ionochaeta, commonly known as the Nikko bamboo, is a variant of the Japanese bamboo species native to the mountainous regions of Honshu, Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with a smooth, light green to yellowish-green stem surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles, which are typically borne in the axils of the lower leaves. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a glossy surface and a pointed tip, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is used in traditional Japanese gardens."
