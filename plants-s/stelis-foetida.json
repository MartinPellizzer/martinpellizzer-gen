    "intro": "Stelis foetida, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its name derives from the unpleasant odor emitted by its flowers, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Stelis foetida is often found in lowland and mountainous regions with high rainfall and partial shade."
