    "intro": "Salvia rhodopea, commonly known as the Rhodope sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Bulgaria. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal remedies. Salvia rhodopea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
