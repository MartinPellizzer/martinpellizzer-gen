    "intro": "Senecio dahuricus var. kamtschaticus, commonly known as the Kamtschatic Mountain ragwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has deeply lobed, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish down. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
