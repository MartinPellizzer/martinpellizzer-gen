    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica f. fultior, commonly known as the Pennsylvania saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges, preferring partial to full shade. The subspecies f. fultior is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different flower coloration compared to the typical form."
