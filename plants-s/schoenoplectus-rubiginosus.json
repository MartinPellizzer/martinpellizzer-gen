    "intro": "Schoenoplectus rubiginosus, commonly known as the red-stem bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, reddish-brown stems that often stand 1 to 3 meters high, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Schoenoplectus rubiginosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for wetland wildlife."
