    "intro": "Sorbus pinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
