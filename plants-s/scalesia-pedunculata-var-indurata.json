    "intro": "Scalesia pedunculata var. indurata, commonly known as the thick-leaved tree heather, is a species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy yellow flowers. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid environment. It grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate of the Gal\u00e1pagos. This variety is part of the Ericaceae family and plays an important role in the island's ecosystem."
