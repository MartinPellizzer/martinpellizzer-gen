    "intro": "Schizoglossum lunatum, commonly known as the moonflower of the desert, is a unique succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically grayish-green, covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Schizoglossum lunatum is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low maintenance requirements."
