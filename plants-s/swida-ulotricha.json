    "intro": "Swida ulotricha, commonly known as the roughleaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Swida ulotricha is typically found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. Its berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity."
