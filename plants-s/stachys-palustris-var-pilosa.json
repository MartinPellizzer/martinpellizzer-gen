    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features erect, hairy stems that often grow up to 30 inches tall, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive fuzzy texture. The plant produces spikes of small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its hairy foliage and flowering structure make it both ecologically valuable and botanically interesting."
