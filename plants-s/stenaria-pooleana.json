It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically with a slightly hairy surface.
