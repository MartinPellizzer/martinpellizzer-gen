    "intro": "Schoenus nitens var. nitens, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green and grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth makes it an effective pioneer species in wetland restoration projects."
