    "intro": "Silene kiwuensis subsp. kiwuensis, commonly known as the Kivu rockflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Albertine Rift region of eastern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in montane grasslands and forest margins. The plant produces striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
