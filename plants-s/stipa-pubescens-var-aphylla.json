    "intro": "Stipa pubescens var. aphylla, commonly known as the hairless feathergrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and less hairy compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
