    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon dealbatum, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or starfruit tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are often pink or white, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. The fruit, though not commonly consumed, is used in traditional medicine and is a subject of botanical study due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
