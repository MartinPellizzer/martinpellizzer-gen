    "intro": "Sisyrinchium spathaceum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous form with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread readily in suitable conditions."
