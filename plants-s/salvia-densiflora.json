    "intro": "Salvia densiflora, commonly known as woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its densely hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia densiflora is also valued for its aromatic properties and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
