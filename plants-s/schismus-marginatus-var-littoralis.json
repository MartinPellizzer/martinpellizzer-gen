    "intro": "Schismus marginatus var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal grass or sand flatweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a characteristic component of coastal vegetation."
