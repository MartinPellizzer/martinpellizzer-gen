    "intro": "Scilla verna var. ramburii, commonly known as the Rambur's spring scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and foliage structure."
