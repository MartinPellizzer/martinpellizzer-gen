These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green, white, and yellow markings. Sanseverinia species are known for their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their minimal care requirements, making them popular indoor plants. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by dark blue or black berries. The genus includes several species, with Sansevieria laudaria and Sansevieria cylindrica being among the most commonly cultivated."
