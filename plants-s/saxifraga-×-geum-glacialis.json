    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 geum glacialis, commonly known as the alpine garden saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
