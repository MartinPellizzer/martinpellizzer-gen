    "intro": "Stipa austromongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
