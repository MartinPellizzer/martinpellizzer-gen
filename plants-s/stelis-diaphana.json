    "intro": "Stelis diaphana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent green leaves and elongated, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Stelis diaphana is classified as endangered in many regions."
