    "intro": "Salix triandra f. androgyna, commonly known as the Androgyna willow, is a variant of the common willow species characterized by its unique floral morphology. This plant exhibits androgeny, a condition where the flowers produce only stamens and no pistils, making it functionally male. It is typically found in temperate regions, often near water sources such as streams and wetlands. The leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. This botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant sexuality and hybridization."
