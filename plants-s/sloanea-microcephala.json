    "intro": "Sloanea microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf sloanea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
