    "intro": "Synthyris houghtoniana, commonly known as Houghton's synthyris, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
