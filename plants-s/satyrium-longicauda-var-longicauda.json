    "intro": "Satyrium longicauda var. longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and its striking, elongated flower spikes that can reach several centimeters in length. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, spurred lip that serves as a pollinator attractant. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
