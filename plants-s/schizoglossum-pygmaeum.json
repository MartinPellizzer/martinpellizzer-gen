    "intro": "Schizoglossum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a small, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its arid habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Schizoglossum pygmaeum is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline."
