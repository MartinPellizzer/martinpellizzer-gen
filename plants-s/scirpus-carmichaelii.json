    "intro": "Scirpus carmichaelii, commonly known as the Chinese bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Scirpus carmichaelii is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional medicine."
