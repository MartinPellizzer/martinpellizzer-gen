    "intro": "Staphylea trifoliata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are typically yellowish-green in color. Its fruits are edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to those of hazelnuts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland environments."
