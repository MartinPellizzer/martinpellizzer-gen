It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, whitish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for its potential in biofuel production."
