    "intro": "Sorghum tropicum, commonly known as tropical sorghum, is a robust grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect stalks and large, feathery inflorescences that produce both male and female flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates and is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in food and animal feed. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Additionally, sorghum tropicum is known for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soil conditions."
