    "intro": "Stellilabium ibischii, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a distinctly shaped labellum that resembles a star, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually a combination of white and yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stellilabium ibischii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
