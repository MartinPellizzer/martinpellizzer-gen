The plant features a slender, wiry stem with numerous small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Stelis zelleri is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
