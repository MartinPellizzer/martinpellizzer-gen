    "intro": "Setaria sphacelata subsp. aquamontana, commonly known as water foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems, with each spikelet containing two to three bract-like structures. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it a useful plant for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in marshy areas."
