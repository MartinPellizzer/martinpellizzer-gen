    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 wehrhahnii, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga cernua and Saxifraga oppositifolia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically rosette-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions."
