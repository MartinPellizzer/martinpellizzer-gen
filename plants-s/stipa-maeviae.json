It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or tufts. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and spike-like, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa maeviae is adapted to cold, dry climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
