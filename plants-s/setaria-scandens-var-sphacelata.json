    "intro": "Setaria scandens var. sphacelata, commonly known as silvergrass or curly bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery sheen on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, feathery appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
