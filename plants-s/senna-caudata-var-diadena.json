    "intro": "Senna caudata var. diadena, commonly known as the red-flowered senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
