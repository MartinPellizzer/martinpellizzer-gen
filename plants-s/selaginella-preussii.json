    "intro": "Selaginella preussii, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance, though it is not a true moss. Selaginella preussii is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures that produce spores. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in compacted soil."
