    "intro": "Stenanthemum notiale subsp. chamelum, commonly known as the golden bell heath, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor environments of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, and the flowers are clustered in inflorescences that resemble bells, giving it its common name. It is a low-growing shrub that plays an important role in the ecological communities of its native range."
