    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor var. sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim sorghum, is a lesser-known variant of sorghum native to the Himalayan region of India. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cooler temperatures and well-drained soils. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. While not as widely cultivated as other sorghum varieties, it holds cultural and potential agricultural significance in its native habitat."
