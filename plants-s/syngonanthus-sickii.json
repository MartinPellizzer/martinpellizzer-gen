    "intro": "Syngonanthus sickii, commonly known as the sick's pittosporum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of dark green, leathery leaves with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, berry-like fruits that are typically orange or red in color. Syngonanthus sickii is often found growing in sandy soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
