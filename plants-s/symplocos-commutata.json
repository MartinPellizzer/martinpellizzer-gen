    "intro": "Symplocos commutata, commonly known as the hairy wax-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically hairy on both surfaces, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Symplocos commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
