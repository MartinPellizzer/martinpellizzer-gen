    "intro": "Schefflera guanayensis, commonly known as the Guanay schefflera, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in umbels, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
