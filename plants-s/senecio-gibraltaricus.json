It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features hairy, gray-green leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
