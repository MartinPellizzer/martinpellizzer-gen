It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a pale green upper surface and a hairy underside. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
