    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 eriophora, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found along riverbanks and in swampy areas."
