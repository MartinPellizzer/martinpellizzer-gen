It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically more tender and less bitter than those of the standard spinach. This subspecies is often grown for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients such as vitamins A and C, iron, and fiber. The plant thrives in cool weather and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is widely cultivated in temperate regions for both home and commercial use."
