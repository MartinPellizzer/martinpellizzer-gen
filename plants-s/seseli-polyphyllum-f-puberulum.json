    "intro": "Seseli polyphyllum f. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent seseli, is a variant of the species Seseli polyphyllum, which belongs to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are compound, with a basal rosette structure, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and habitat preferences."
