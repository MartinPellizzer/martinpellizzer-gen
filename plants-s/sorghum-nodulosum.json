    "intro": "Sorghum nodulosum, commonly known as the woolly sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomes are often swollen and nodular, contributing to its scientific name. Sorghum nodulosum is adapted to dry environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
