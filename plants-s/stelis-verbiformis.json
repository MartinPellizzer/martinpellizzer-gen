    "intro": "Stelis verbiformis, commonly known as the leafy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, leaf-like appearance, with long, narrow leaves that resemble foliage rather than typical orchid flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Stelis verbiformis is valued in horticulture for its unusual morphology and ability to thrive in shaded, high-humidity conditions."
