    "intro": "Salisburyodendron ovata subsp. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is often found in moist bottomlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils."
