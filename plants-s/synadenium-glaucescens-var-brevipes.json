It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The species is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ornamental appearance."
