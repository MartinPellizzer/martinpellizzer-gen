    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. latius, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature, often containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
