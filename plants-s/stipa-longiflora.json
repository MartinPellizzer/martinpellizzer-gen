    "intro": "Stipa longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. Stipa longiflora is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
