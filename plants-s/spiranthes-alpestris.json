    "intro": "Spiranthes alpestris, commonly known as the alpine spiral orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Spiranthes alpestris is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its unique floral structure and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
