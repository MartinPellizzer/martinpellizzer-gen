    "intro": "Scirpus stellatus, commonly known as star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like inflorescence, which consists of multiple slender, spiraling spikes of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that makes it useful in ecological restoration projects. Scirpus stellatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
