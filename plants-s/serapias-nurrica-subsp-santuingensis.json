    "intro": "Serapias nurrica subsp. santuingensis, commonly known as the Santuingshine orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sardinia, Italy. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a yellow corolla with a distinctive red lip. The plant is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces its flowers on slender, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
