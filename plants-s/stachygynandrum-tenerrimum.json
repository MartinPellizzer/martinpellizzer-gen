    "intro": "Stachygynandrum tenerrimum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the canopy of longleaf pine forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
