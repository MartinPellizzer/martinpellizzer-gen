    "intro": "Spergularia capillacea var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal regions. It is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs. The flowers are typically pink or reddish, with five petals and stamens that are often longer than the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes and roadsides. This plant plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
