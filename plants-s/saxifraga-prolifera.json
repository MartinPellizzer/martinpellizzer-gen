    "intro": "Saxifraga prolifera, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are closely spaced and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saxifraga prolifera is known for its ability to propagate vegetatively through its stems, allowing it to form dense mats in its natural habitat."
