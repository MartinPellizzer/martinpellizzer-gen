    "intro": "Satureja alpina var. amplifoliata, commonly known as alpine savory, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their pungent, thyme-like aroma. The variety amplifoliata is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Satureja alpina."
