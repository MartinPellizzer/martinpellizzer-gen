    "intro": "Schwabea anisacanthus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features silver-gray foliage and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested. Schwabea anisacanthus is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
