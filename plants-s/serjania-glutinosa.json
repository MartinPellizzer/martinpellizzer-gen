    "intro": "Serjania glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky serjania, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Serjania glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
