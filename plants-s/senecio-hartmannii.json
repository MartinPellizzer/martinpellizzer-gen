    "intro": "Senecio hartmannii, commonly known as Hartmann's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in rocky soils and open habitats. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a woolly texture, and it produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Senecio hartmannii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
