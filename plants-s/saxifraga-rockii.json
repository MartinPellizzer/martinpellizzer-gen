    "intro": "Saxifraga rockii, commonly known as the Korean saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga rockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
