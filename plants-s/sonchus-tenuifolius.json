    "intro": "Sonchus tenuifolius, commonly known as slenderleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Sonchus tenuifolius is considered a weed in agricultural fields but is also valued for its nutritional content in some regions."
