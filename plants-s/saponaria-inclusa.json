    "intro": "Saponaria inclusa, commonly known as the clustered soapwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, branched stems that bear clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant has palmate leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating. Its root system produces a milky sap, which is known for its soap-like properties. Saponaria inclusa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
