    "intro": "Specklinia gelida, commonly known as the cold mountain fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or pale green coating. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Specklinia gelida is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
