    "intro": "Sabulina mesogitana subsp. kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschyan's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
