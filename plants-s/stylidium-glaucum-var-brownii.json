It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its pale green stems and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
