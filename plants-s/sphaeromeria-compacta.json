    "intro": "Sphaeromeria compacta, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, rounded growth with small, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
