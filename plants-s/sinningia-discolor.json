    "intro": "Sinningia discolor, commonly known as the silver mottled toad lily, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It features vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting purple or blue throat. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a silvery, waxy coating that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
