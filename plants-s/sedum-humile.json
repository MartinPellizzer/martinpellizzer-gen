    "intro": "Sedum humile, commonly known as dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum humile is also valued for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
