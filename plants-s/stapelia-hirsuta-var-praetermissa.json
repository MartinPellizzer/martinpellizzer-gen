    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta var. praetermissa, commonly known as the Hirsute Stapelia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem with a distinctive, hairy texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, fleshy, yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are modified into thick, fleshy structures adapted for water storage, typical of desert plants. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
