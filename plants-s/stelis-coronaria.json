    "intro": "Stelis coronaria, commonly known as the crowned stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a crown-like arrangement, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Stelis coronaria is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
