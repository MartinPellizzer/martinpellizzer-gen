    "intro": "Sorghum caudatum var. aristatum, commonly known as the feathered sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often feathery inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, thriving in warm climates. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, clustered flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
