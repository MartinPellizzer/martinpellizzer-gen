    "intro": "Solanum incomptum var. longiuspilosum, commonly known as the long-hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically orange to red in color when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care."
