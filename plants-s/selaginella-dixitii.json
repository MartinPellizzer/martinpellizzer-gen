    "intro": "Selaginella dixitii, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle with a distinct sporophyte and gametophyte stage, characteristic of bryophytes and ferns. Its leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls, contributing to its compact, club-like appearance. Selaginella dixitii is also noted for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing structures."
