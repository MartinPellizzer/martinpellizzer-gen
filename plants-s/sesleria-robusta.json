It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or silver sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Sesleria robusta is often used in rock gardens and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
