    "intro": "Schmaltzia tridophylloides, commonly known as the three-lobed schmaltzia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are divided into three distinct lobes. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters, blooming during the late spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Schmaltzia tridophylloides is considered a species of conservation concern."
