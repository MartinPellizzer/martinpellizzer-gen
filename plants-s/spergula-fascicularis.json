    "intro": "Spergula fascicularis, commonly known as clustered mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically pink or white, clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Spergula fascicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
