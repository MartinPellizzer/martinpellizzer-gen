    "intro": "Seseli purpurascens var. acaule, commonly known as purple-flowered seseli, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, clustered umbels of purple to pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety lacks a true stem base, with the leaves directly arising from the root system, a feature that sets it apart from other varieties within the genus."
