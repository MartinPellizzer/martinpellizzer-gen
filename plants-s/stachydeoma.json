    "intro": "Stachydeoma, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spiky seed heads that persist through winter. Stachydeoma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are relatively drought-tolerant. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
