It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
