    "intro": "Strombocactus \u00d7 roseiflorus, commonly known as the pink-flowered strombocactus, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces striking pink or reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries."
