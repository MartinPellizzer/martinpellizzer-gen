    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. ccusi, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and dark purple berries. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces edible berries that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and unique morphological traits compared to other Solanum species."
