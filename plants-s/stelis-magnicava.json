    "intro": "Stelis magnicava, commonly known as the giant stelis orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant produces intricate, fragrant blossoms in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with contrasting veining. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and beauty, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized orchid collections."
