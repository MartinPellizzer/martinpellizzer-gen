    "intro": "Santaloides bamangensis, commonly known as the Bamangensis sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that attract various pollinators. Its woody roots are valued for their aromatic oils, which have traditional medicinal uses among local communities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
