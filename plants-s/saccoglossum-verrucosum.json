    "intro": "Saccoglossum verrucosum, commonly known as the wrinkled sac slug, is a species of sea slug found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Sacoglossa and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in small, wrinkled projections. The plant-like appearance of this species is due to its ability to absorb nutrients through its skin, similar to some algae. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters and is often associated with algae, which it feeds on. Saccoglossum verrucosum plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine organisms."
