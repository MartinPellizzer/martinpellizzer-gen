    "intro": "Saxifraga callosa subsp. callosa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with succulent leaves that store water and aid in survival. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
