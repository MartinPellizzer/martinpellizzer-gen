    "intro": "Schefflera minutipetiolata, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded canopy of dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai cultivation."
