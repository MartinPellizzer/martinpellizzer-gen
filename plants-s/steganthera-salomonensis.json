    "intro": "Steganthera salomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, woody shrub form with compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
