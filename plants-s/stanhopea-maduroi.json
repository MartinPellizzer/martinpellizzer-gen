It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stanhopea maduroi is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
