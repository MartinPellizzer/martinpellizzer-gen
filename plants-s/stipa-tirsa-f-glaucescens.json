    "intro": "Stipa tirsa f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green blades and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
