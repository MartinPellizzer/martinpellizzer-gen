    "intro": "Sesbania hirtistyla var. muricata, commonly known as the rough sesbania, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers followed by elongated, hairy pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
