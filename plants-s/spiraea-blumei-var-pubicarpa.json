It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin and a smooth upper surface. This variety is distinguished by its hairy or pubescent texture on the stems and young leaves. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate floral display."
