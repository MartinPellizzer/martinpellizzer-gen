    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. monticola, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish or purple-hued. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in mountainous habitats."
