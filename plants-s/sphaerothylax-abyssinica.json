    "intro": "Sphaerothylax abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian globular cactus, is a succulent plant native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
