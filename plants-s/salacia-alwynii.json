It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its most striking feature is its clusters of bright yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
