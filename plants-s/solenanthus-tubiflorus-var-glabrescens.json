    "intro": "Solenanthus tubiflorus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming low, mat-like structures that help stabilize sandy or salty soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a velvety texture. The species is well adapted to maritime environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
