    "intro": "Scolopendrium hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to form dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released during the dry season. Scolopendrium hybridum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas."
