    "intro": "Strophopappus bullatus, commonly known as the bullate cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, dense foliage with dark green, scale-like leaves that provide a lush, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. Its ornamental value lies in its neat form and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
