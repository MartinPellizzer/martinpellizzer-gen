    "intro": "Staehelina centauroides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, fleshy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or divided. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Staehelina centauroides plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing food for desert wildlife."
