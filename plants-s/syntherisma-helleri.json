    "intro": "Syntherisma helleri, commonly known as the Heller's syntherism, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences that display a combination of white and violet petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syntherisma helleri is considered a species of conservation concern."
