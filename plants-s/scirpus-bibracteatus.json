    "intro": "Scirpus bibracteatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are broad and flat, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Scirpus bibracteatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
