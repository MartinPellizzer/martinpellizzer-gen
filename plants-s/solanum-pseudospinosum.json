It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
