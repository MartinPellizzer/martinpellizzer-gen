    "intro": "Sphaeranthus suberiflorus, commonly known as the woolly flowerbed grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and dry gardens."
