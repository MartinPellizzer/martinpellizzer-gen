    "intro": "Salix glauca subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. It is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ability to stabilize riverbanks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
