    "intro": "Sturmia angustilabris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sturmia, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often reddish stems. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
