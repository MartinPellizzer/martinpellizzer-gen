    "intro": "Salix megalophylla, commonly known as the giant willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins as its flowers, which are typically male and female, and it is often found in moist, riparian habitats. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced with age. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
