    "intro": "Sparganium emersum, commonly known as the marsh spikerush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that rise from a rhizomatous base, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps anchor the plant in wetland habitats. Sparganium emersum is typically found in shallow water or moist soils, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks."
