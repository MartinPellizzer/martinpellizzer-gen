    "intro": "Scepasma longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved scepasma, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
