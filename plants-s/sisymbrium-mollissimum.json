It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
