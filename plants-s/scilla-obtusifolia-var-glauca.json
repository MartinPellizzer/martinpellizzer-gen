    "intro": "Scilla obtusifolia var. glauca, commonly known as blue scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The varietal name 'glauca' refers to the bluish hue of its foliage, which adds to its ornamental appeal."
