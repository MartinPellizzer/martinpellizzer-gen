    "intro": "Samolus latifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved samolus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Samolus latifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
