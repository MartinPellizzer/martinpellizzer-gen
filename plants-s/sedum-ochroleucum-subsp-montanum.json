    "intro": "Sedum ochroleucum subsp. montanum, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid environments."
