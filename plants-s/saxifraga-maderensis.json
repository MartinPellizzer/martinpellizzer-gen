    "intro": "Saxifraga maderensis, commonly known as the Madeira saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Azores and Madeira Islands. It is a perennial herb with basal leaves and upright flowering stems that bear small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native region. Saxifraga maderensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
