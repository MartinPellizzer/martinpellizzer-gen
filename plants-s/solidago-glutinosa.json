    "intro": "Solidago glutinosa, commonly known as sticky goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Solidago glutinosa is an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators."
