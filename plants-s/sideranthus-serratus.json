    "intro": "Sideranthus serratus, commonly known as the hairy sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its serrated leaf margins. Sideranthus serratus typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
