    "intro": "Silene lulakabadensis, commonly known as the Lulakabad catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Silene lulakabadensis has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
