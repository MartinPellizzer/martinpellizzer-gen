    "intro": "Schedonorus procerus, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-based flowers. It is widely cultivated for forage and turfgrass due to its drought tolerance and adaptability to various soil types. Schedonorus procerus is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with endophytic fungi, which can influence its growth and resistance to pests."
