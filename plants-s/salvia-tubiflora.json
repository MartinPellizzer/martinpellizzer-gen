    "intro": "Salvia tubiflora, commonly known as the tuberous sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, aromatic leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tuberous roots, which are adapted for storing nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Salvia tubiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
