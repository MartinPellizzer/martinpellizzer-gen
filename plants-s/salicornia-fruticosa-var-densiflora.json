    "intro": "Salicornia fruticosa var. densiflora, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its nutritional value has led to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
