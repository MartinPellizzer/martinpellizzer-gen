    "intro": "Solanum mixtipilosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from green to red as they mature. Solanum mixtipilosum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
