    "intro": "Selinum nodosum, commonly known as sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its aromatic, feathery leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in salt marshes and tidal zones. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Its unique ecological role helps stabilize coastal soils and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
