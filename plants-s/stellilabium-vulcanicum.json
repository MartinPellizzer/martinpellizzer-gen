    "intro": "Stellilabium vulcanicum, commonly known as the Flame-veined Orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range from deep red to orange, with intricate veining that resembles flames. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and exotic plant collections. Stellilabium vulcanicum is also noted for its ability to flourish in nutrient-poor soils, a trait that reflects its adaptation to volcanic terrain."
