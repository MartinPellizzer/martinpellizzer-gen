    "intro": "Scirpus merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland stabilization. Scirpus merrillii plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
