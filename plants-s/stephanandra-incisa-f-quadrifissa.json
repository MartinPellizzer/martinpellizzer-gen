    "intro": "Stephanandra incisa f. quadrifissa, commonly known as the four-leaf stephanandra, is a unique variant of the stephanandra species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrifid (four-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of the plant. The foliage is often glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. This ornamental plant is prized for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
