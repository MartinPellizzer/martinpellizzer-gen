    "intro": "Sapium leucospermum, commonly known as the white-flowered Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by yellowish or orange fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions as a landscape plant. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
