    "intro": "Salix unalaschkensis, commonly known as the Alaskan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America and parts of Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, often alpine or arctic environments, where it thrives in cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant has slender, often multi-stemmed branches and produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
