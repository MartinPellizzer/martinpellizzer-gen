    "intro": "Scleria graeffeana, commonly known as the African flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria graeffeana typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
