    "intro": "Schefflera multifoliolata, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like crown composed of multiple branches that bear palmate leaves. The leaves are typically large, glossy, and deeply lobed, providing a striking visual appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
