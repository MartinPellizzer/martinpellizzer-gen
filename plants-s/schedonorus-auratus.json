    "intro": "Schedonorus auratus, commonly known as the golden bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, silver-gray blades with a distinctive golden hue, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a turfgrass in certain regions."
