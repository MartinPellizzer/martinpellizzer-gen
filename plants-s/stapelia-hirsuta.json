    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Stapeliad, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its ability to store water, which helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia hirsuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
