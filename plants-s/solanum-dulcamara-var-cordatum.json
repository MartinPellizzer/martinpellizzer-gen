    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed species. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces berries that transition from green to yellowish-red as they mature. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along fences. Its botanical features make it both a horticultural curiosity and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
