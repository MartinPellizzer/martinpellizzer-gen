    "intro": "Selliguea wuliangshanensis, commonly known as the Wuliangshan moss, is a rare species of liverwort found in specific mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important indicator species for studying ecological diversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
