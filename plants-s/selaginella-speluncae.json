    "intro": "Selaginella speluncae, commonly known as the cave spikemoss, is a rare and specialized vascular plant native to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves, where it relies on dim light from fissures or bioluminescent fungi for photosynthesis. The plant has adapted to low-light conditions with reduced leaf size and elongated stems. Its sporophyte stage is particularly well-developed, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sporangia. Selaginella speluncae plays a unique ecological role in cave ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting specialized microfauna."
