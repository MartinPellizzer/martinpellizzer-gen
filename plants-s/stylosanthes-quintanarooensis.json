    "intro": "Stylosanthes quintanarooensis, commonly known as the Queensland stylo, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Australia. It has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in pasture improvement due to its high nutritional value and ability to fix nitrogen."
