    "intro": "Schranckia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Schranckia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, dry fruits called cypsela. These plants are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
