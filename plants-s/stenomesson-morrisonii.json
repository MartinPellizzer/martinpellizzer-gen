    "intro": "Stenomesson morrisonii, commonly known as the Morrison's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it is characterized by its unique, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and a compact, upright growth habit. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
