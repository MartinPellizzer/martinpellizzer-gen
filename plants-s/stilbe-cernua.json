    "intro": "Stilbe cernua, commonly known as the nodding willow-herb, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic or moist environments. Stilbe cernua is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams where it thrives in consistently wet conditions."
