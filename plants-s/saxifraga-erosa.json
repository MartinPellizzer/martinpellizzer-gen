    "intro": "Saxifraga erosa, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and coastal environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually green, sometimes with a bluish tint, and are arranged in a rosette pattern. Saxifraga erosa is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
