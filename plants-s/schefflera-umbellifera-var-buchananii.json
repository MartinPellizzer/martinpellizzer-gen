    "intro": "Schefflera umbellifera var. buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, leathery leaves that give it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Its growth habit makes it suitable for both indoor and outdoor gardening in suitable climates."
