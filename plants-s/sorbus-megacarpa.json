    "intro": "Sorbus megacarpa, commonly known as the giant crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces large, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The species is valued in horticulture for its vibrant fall color and ecological benefits to wildlife."
