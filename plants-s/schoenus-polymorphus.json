It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its adaptability to varying water conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
