It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found on rocky or sandy substrates. The plant has a dark green to reddish-brown color, with leaf margins that are often recurved. It is well adapted to arid environments and can survive in low-nutrient conditions. Selliguea oodes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other small organisms."
