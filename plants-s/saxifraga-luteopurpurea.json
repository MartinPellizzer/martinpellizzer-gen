It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to purple. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive purplish hue that adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. This plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
