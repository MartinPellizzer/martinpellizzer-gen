    "intro": "Stellaria brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petalled starwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has delicate, branching stems and hairy leaves that help it withstand cold temperatures. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, exposed habitats. Stellaria brachypetala plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
