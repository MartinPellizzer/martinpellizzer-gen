    "intro": "Selaginella wallichii var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. It produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib. The plant forms cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
