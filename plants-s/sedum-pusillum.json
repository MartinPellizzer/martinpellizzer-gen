    "intro": "Sedum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid regions. It features fleshy, erect or spreading stems and small, often clustered leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environments."
