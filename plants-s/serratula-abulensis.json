    "intro": "Serratula abulensis, commonly known as the Abulensian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. Serratula abulensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties remain under scientific investigation."
