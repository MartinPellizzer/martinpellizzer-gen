    "intro": "Salmea glaberrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf salmea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has hairy stems that become smooth as it matures. Its leaves are ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Salmea glaberrima is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
