    "intro": "Salsola pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf saltbush, is a small, annual shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches and has small, succulent, spiny leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. Salsola pygmaea is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation. Its hardy nature makes it a common component of desert and coastal sage scrub ecosystems."
