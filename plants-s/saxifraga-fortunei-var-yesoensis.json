    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. yesoensis, commonly known as the Yeso saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Japan. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically rosette-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist conditions."
