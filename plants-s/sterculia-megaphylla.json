    "intro": "Sterculia megaphylla, commonly known as the giant fan-leaf sterculia, is a striking tropical plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
