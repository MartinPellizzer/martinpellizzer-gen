    "intro": "Selinum dubium subsp. salinum, commonly known as the salt saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it thrives in high-salinity soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it is considered an important indicator species for saline habitats."
