    "intro": "Schizocarpum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's schizocarp, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the development of schizocarps, which are dry, multi-seeded fruits that split into separate parts upon maturity. Schizocarpum palmeri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
