    "intro": "Sapium haematospermum, commonly known as bloodseed or redseed tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain black seeds. Its botanical interest lies in its unique seed structure and its role in local ecosystems. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
