    "intro": "Steris \u00d7 viburgensis, commonly known as the hybrid viburnum, is a deciduous shrub that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Steris and Viburnum. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring dense, rounded foliage that turns vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates further enhances its appeal in landscaping."
