    "intro": "Styrax serrulatus var. mollissimum, commonly known as the velvetwood or silky styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
