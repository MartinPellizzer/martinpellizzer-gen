It is characterized by its arching, cascading branches that bear clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and naturalized areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
