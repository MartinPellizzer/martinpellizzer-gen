It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found growing on cliffs and rock faces."
