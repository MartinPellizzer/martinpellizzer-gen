It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded canopy. The plant is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in furniture-making, though the species is also appreciated for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
