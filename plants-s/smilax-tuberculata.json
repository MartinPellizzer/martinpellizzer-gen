    "intro": "Smilax tuberculata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed smilax, is a perennial climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in small, tuberculate (knob-like) protrusions, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, and they can be either smooth or slightly hairy depending on the variety. Smilax tuberculata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its hardy, resilient nature."
