    "intro": "Statice sabulosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs. Statice sabulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
