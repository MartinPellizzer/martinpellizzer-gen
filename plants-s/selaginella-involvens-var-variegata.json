    "intro": "Selaginella involvens var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features elongated, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are usually a mix of green and variegated colors, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices."
