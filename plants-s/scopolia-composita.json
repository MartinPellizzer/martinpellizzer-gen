    "intro": "Scopolia composita, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Scopolia composita is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and meadows. Its name is derived from the Latin \"scopulus,\" meaning rock, referring to its preference for rocky or limestone soils."
