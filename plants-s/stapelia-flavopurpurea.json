    "intro": "Stapelia flavopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow with purple markings. These flowers open in the early morning and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia flavopurpurea is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
