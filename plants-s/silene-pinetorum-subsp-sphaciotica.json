    "intro": "Silene pinetorum subsp. sphaciotica, commonly known as the pine forest catchfly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as forest edges, clearings, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. Silene pinetorum subsp. sphaciotica is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with coniferous forests."
