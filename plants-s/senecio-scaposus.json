    "intro": "Senecio scaposus, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio scaposus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
