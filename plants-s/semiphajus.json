    "intro": "Semiphajus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender stems and small, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations for survival in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Semiphajus is considered critically endangered in many regions."
