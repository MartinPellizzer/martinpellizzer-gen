    "intro": "Smilax astrosperma, commonly known as the starfruit vine, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and thorny growth habit, which help it to climb and spread through various habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright orange, fleshy fruits resembling star shapes, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy texture and often have a slight scent. Smilax astrosperma is adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
