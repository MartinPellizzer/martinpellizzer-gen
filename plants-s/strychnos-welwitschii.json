    "intro": "Strychnos welwitschii, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feather-like in appearance, and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Strychnos welwitschii is also notable for containing toxic alkaloids, which have been studied for their medicinal and biochemical properties."
