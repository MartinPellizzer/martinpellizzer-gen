It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and erect, branched growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Salicornia pachystachya is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture and as a source of edible plant material."
