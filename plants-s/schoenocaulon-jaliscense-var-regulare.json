    "intro": "Schoenocaulon jaliscense var. regulare, commonly known as the Mexican stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the highlands of Jalisco, Mexico. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth habit with fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant in arid climates."
