    "intro": "Staphylea brighamii, commonly known as Brigham's bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Staphyleaceae family and is characterized by its small, bladder-like fruits that split open when mature. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
