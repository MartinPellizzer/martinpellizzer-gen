    "intro": "Sagina maxima subsp. crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes, rock crevices, and disturbed areas. The plant features small, fleshy, oval leaves arranged in dense clusters, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the leaf axils. It is a perennial species with a compact growth habit, often forming dense ground cover. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader and more robust stems compared to other members of the Sagina genus."
