    "intro": "Sedum oligocarpum, commonly known as the silver rose or snow sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
