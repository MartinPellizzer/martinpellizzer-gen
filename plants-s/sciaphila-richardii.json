    "intro": "Sciaphila richardii, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the shade of the forest canopy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of the forest floor. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila richardii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered vulnerable to habitat loss."
