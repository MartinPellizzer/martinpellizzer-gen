    "intro": "Stellaria edwardsii, commonly known as Edwards' starwort, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
