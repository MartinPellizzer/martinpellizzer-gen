    "intro": "Scirpus arenicola, commonly known as the sand reed, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in estuaries and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Scirpus arenicola is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate periodic flooding."
