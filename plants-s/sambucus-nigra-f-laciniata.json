It produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The leaves are aromatic when crushed, adding to its sensory appeal."
