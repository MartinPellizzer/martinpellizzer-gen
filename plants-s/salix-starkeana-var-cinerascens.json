    "intro": "Salix starkeana var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a silvery or ash-gray hue on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are typical of willow species and serve as the primary means of pollen dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin strips, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
