    "intro": "Spiraea aquilegiifolia, commonly known as the water spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats or wet meadows. Its foliage is typically dark green, and it produces small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Spiraea aquilegiifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging wet conditions."
