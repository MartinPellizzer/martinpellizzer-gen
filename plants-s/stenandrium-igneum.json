    "intro": "Stenandrium igneum, commonly known as the flame fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its vibrant red and orange spore-bearing fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant's fronds are typically lance-shaped and possess a unique, fiery coloration that distinguishes it from other fern species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
