    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pseudoelaeagnos, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
