    "intro": "Seseli rigidum subvar. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate rigid seseli, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
