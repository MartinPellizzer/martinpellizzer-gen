It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often hairy. Salacia campestris is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
