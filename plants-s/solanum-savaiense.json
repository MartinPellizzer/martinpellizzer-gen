    "intro": "Solanum savaiense, commonly known as the Savaii nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces small, smooth, yellow or orange berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
