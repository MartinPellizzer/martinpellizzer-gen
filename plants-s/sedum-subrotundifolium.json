    "intro": "Sedum subrotundifolium, commonly known as the rounded-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping to add texture and color to dry environments."
