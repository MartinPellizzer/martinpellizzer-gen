    "intro": "Sagittaria rigida var. engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that emerge from water, often floating on the surface or submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize wetlands and marshes effectively. Engelmann's arrowhead is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
