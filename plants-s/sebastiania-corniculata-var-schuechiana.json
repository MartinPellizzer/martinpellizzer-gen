    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata var. schuechiana, commonly known as the Schuechian's silverleaf, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray, velvety foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique appearance and adaptability to humid conditions."
