    "intro": "Scorzonera villosa subsp. columnae, commonly known as the woolly scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is tuberous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Scorzonera villosa subsp. columnae thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
