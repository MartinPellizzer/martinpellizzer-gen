    "intro": "Stenostephanus maximus, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Stenostephanus maximus is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is a hardy species well-suited to harsh desert environments."
