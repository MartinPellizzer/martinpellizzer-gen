    "intro": "Spergula pentandra var. celtiberica, commonly known as the Celtiberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, three-angled spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
