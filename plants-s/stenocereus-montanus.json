    "intro": "Stenocereus montanus, commonly known as the mountain cholla, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that branch out into dense clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant is also known for its ability to form large, sprawling colonies through vegetative reproduction."
