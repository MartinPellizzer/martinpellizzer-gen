    "intro": "Silene muricata, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, depending on the stage of bloom. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Silene muricata is known for its short flowering period, usually in spring, and is often found in sunny, well-drained soils."
