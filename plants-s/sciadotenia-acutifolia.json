    "intro": "Sciadotenia acutifolia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in soil stabilization and as a source of medicinal compounds."
