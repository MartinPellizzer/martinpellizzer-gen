    "intro": "Synostemon spinosus, commonly known as the spiny synostemon, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that are often covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Synostemon spinosus thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
