    "intro": "Salpinga peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian horned orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structures that resemble horns. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color and are adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Salpinga peruviana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
