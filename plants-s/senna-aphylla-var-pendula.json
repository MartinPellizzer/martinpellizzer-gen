    "intro": "Senna aphylla var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping, feathery foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in pairs. The weeping senna is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
