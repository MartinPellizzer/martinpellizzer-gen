    "intro": "Silene nummica, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Silene nummica is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sandy or gravelly habitats."
