    "intro": "Schoenus triangularis, commonly known as the triangular bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Schoenus triangularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
