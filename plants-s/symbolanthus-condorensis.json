    "intro": "Symbolanthus condorensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to the cold, high-altitude climate. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Symbolanthus condorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
