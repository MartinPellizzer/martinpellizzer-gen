    "intro": "Setaria gracilis var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical variety of Setaria gracilis. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
