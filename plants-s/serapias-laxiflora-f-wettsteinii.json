    "intro": "Serapias laxiflora f. wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's looseflower orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and striking, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The inflorescence typically consists of a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
