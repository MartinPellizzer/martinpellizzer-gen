    "intro": "Sambucus monstrosa, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces dark red, toxic berries in the fall, which are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications despite their toxicity. Sambucus monstrosa typically grows in moist, shady areas and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture."
