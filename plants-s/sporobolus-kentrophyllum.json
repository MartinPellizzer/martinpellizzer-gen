    "intro": "Sporobolus kentrophyllum, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and wiry, three-awned lemma structures that give it its common name. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. Botanically, it is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils in disturbed areas."
