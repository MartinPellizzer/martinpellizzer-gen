    "intro": "Saxifraga bicolor, commonly known as the two-color saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically basal and arranged in a rosette, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
