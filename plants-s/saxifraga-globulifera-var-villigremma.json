    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. villigremma, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Saxifraga globulifera."
