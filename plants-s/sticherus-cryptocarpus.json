    "intro": "Sticherus cryptocarpus, commonly known as the hidden fruit moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth form and dark green, closely appressed leaves. The plant produces spore capsules that are initially enclosed within a cupule, a feature that contributes to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Sticherus cryptocarpus is typically found in temperate regions and is often used in ecological studies to monitor environmental conditions."
