    "intro": "Sobralia paradisiaca, commonly known as the Paradise Sobralia, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that come in a variety of vibrant colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Sobralia paradisiaca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its dramatic floral displays."
