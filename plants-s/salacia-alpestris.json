    "intro": "Salacia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine salacia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually narrow and leathery. Salacia alpestris is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
