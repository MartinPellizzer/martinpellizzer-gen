    "intro": "Sessea multiflora, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Sessea multiflora is often found in arid or semi-arid regions and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
