    "intro": "Selaginella sartorii, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, thread-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella sartorii is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its use in traditional medicine in some cultures."
