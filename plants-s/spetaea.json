    "intro": "Spetaea, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds surrounded by a papery covering. Spetaea is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity."
