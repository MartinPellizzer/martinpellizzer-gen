    "intro": "Salix halleri, commonly known as Haller's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Tibet and the Himalayas. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Salix halleri is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
