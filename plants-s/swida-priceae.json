    "intro": "Swida priceae, commonly known as the Price's swida, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of alpine flora and plant adaptation strategies."
