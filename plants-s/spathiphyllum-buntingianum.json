    "intro": "Spathiphyllum buntingianum, commonly known as the Bunting's peace lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces elegant white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Spathiphyllum buntingianum is valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
