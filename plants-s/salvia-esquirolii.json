    "intro": "Salvia esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia esquirolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
