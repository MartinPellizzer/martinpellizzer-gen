    "intro": "Sonchus spinosus var. commutatus, commonly known as the spiny sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of spiny, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
