    "intro": "Serratula alata, commonly known as the goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a distinctive, pungent odor, which is often described as similar to that of a goat. Serratula alata is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. It has been used historically in traditional medicine, though its use is now limited due to potential toxicity."
