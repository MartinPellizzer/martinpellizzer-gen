    "intro": "Spathiphyllum globulispadix, commonly known as the globe-clubbed peace lily, is a tropical plant native to the understory of humid forests. It features broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically lance-shaped and can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces a striking, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a large, white spathe, which gives it its common name. It thrives in low light conditions and requires consistent moisture and moderate humidity. Its air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
