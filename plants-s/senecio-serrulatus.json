It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, serrated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower structure. Senecio serrulatus is often used in succulent gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
