    "intro": "Scirpus humboldtii, commonly known as Humboldt's bulrush, is a tall, perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and brackish tidal areas, and is characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its wetland environment. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Scirpus humboldtii plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various birds and insects."
