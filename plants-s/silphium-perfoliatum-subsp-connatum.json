    "intro": "Silphium perfoliatum subsp. connatum, commonly known as the eastern milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and often have a distinctive, heart-shaped appearance. Silphium perfoliatum subsp. connatum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and habitat."
