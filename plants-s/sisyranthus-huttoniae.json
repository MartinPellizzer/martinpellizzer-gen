    "intro": "Sisyranthus huttoniae, commonly known as the Hutton's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in the unique microclimates of its native environment. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
