    "intro": "Sedum pluricaule var. hidakanum, commonly known as the Hidaka sedum, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
