    "intro": "Selaginella mucugensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss found in the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and root-like structures called rhizomes. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
