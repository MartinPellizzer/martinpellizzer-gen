    "intro": "Sanguisorba grandiflora, commonly known as the tall stonecrop, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of bright red, urn-shaped flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Sanguisorba grandiflora is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
