    "intro": "[WRONG START] Spatalllopsis confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a striking example of adaptation to its humid, shaded environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Spatallopsis confusa is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
