    "intro": "Spiranthes diaphana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family found primarily in the southeastern United States. This plant is characterized by its delicate, white, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Spiranthes diaphana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in pine flatwoods or wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
