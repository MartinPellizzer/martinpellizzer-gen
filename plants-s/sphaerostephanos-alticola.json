    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos alticola, commonly known as the highland starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
