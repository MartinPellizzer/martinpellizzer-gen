    "intro": "Salix gymnolepis, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Salix gymnolepis is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in cooler climates."
