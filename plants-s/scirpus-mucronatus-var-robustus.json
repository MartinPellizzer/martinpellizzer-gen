    "intro": "Scirpus mucronatus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its tall, triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage, which are typical features of the Cyperaceae family. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing wetland habitats and supporting local biodiversity."
