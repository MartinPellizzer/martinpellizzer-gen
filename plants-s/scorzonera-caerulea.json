It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are typically borne on elongated stems and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
