The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
