    "intro": "Schefflera impressa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a distinctive central vein. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a houseplant."
