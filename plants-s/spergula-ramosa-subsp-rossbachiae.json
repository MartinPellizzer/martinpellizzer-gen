    "intro": "Spergula ramosa subsp. rossbachiae, commonly known as the Rossbach's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has slender, wiry stems that are often branched. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
