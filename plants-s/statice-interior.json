    "intro": "Statice interior, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and silver-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice interior is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in floral arrangements and as a garden plant."
