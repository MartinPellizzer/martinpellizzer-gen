It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, golden-bracted inflorescences. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking yellow coloration. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Setaria chrysantha is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some areas."
