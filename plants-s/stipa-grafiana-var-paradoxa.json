It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red hues. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that adds visual interest to its habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
