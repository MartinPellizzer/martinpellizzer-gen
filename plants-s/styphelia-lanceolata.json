    "intro": "Styphelia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Styphelia lanceolata is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
