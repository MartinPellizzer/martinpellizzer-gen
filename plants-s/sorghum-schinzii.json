    "intro": "Sorghum schinzii, commonly known as Schinz's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Sorghum schinzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control due to its extensive root system."
