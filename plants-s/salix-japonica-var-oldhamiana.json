    "intro": "Salix japonica var. oldhamiana, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
