    "intro": "Senecio moelleri, commonly known as the blue-green ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
