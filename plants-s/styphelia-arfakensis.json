    "intro": "Styphelia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in a compact rosette pattern, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Styphelia arfakensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
