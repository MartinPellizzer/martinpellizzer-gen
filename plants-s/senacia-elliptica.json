    "intro": "Senacia elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, hence the species name, and are often covered in fine hairs. Senacia elliptica is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
