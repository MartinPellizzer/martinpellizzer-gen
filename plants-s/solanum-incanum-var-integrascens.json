    "intro": "Solanum incanum var. integrascens, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and leaves, which are covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, green berries. These berries turn red when mature and are edible, though the plant contains toxic compounds. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils."
