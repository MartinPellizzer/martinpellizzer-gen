    "intro": "Scutellaria grandiflora, commonly known as large-flowered blueflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, two-lipped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of rhizomes and tubers, which help it survive in moist, woodland environments. Scutellaria grandiflora is often found in shaded areas along streams and in wet meadows."
