    "intro": "Sphaeropteris holttumiana, commonly known as the Holttum's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
