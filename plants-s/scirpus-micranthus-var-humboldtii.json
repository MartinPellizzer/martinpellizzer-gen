    "intro": "Scirpus micranthus var. humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
