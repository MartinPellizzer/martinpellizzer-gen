    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Adoxaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and divided into 5-7 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, followed by white to pale yellow berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared carefully before consumption. It is often used in traditional medicine and for making jams and wines."
