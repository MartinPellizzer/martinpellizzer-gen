    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive and often picturesque appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on top and lighter green underneath. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The weeping willow is also notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in preventing soil erosion."
