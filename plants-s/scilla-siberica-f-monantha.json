    "intro": "Scilla siberica f. monantha, commonly known as the Siberian squill, is a botanical variant of the Siberian squill species. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central Asia, including regions of Russia and China. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers in early spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. Botanically, it is characterized by its single-flowered inflorescence, which distinguishes it from the typical form of Scilla siberica."
