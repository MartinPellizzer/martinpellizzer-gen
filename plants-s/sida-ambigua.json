    "intro": "Sida ambigua, commonly known as the common sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or subshrub that typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and it has a sprawling growth habit. Sida ambigua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
