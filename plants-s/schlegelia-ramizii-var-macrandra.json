    "intro": "Schlegelia ramizii var. macrandra, commonly known as the large-flowered schlegelia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
