It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Senegalia kostermansii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
