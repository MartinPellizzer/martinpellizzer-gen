It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its small white or greenish flowers are often clustered in flat-topped umbels, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Smirnowia iranica is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and conservation studies."
