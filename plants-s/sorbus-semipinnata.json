    "intro": "Sorbus semipinnata, commonly known as the red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its bark is often reddish and peels in thin, papery layers, adding to its ornamental value. Sorbus semipinnata is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
