    "intro": "Salix caprea var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are rounded at the base, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. The bark is often reddish-brown and smooth, with a fragrant scent when crushed."
