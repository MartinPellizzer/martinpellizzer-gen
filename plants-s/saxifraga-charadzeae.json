    "intro": "Saxifraga charadzeae, commonly known as the Georgian saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
