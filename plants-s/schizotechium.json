It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plants typically grow as succulent herbs or small shrubs, with fleshy leaves and showy inflorescences. Schizotechium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant colors and unique floral structure. They are also used in traditional medicine in some regions for their purported health benefits."
