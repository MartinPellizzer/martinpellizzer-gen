    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis f. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf dropwort, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems with small, dark red to purple leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardens for its attractive, textured appearance. This variety is more compact than the species, making it suitable for rock gardens or small spaces."
