    "intro": "Salicornia stricta subsp. procumbens, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of salt. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and the stems are rich in minerals, making it a valuable plant for coastal ecosystems. It is often found in salt marshes and tidal flats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various organisms."
