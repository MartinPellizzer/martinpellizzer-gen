    "intro": "Stenophyllus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable microhabitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Stenophyllus stenophyllus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a lush, green texture to gardens."
