    "intro": "Salix lasiolepis var. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
