    "intro": "Sagittaria arifolia var. polymorpha, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
