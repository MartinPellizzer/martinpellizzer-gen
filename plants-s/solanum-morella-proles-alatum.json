    "intro": "Solanum morella proles alatum, commonly known as the winged nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive winged leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a smooth, fleshy berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. Like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
