    "intro": "Sclerolaena obconica, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its woody stems are strong and resistant to damage, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. Sclerolaena obconica is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils."
