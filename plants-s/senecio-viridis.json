    "intro": "Senecio viridis, commonly known as the green everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
