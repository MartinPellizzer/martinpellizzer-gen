    "intro": "Saussurea pycnocephala, commonly known as the dense-headed safflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing a robust root system adapted to survive in harsh conditions. The plant produces large, showy flower heads that are often yellow or orange in color, with numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Saussurea pycnocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
