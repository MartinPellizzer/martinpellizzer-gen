    "intro": "Selaginella brachystachya var. ornata, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, moss-like appearance with closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores, which are released during the dry season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens."
