    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 anormalis, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in rocky, alpine environments. Saxifraga \u00d7 anormalis is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
