    "intro": "Systrepha, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or blue. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, Systrepha species are often found in forested areas and mountainous regions. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers open in the morning, giving the plant its common name. Systrepha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
