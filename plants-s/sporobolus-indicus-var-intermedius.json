    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and withstand drought conditions."
