    "intro": "Sticherus moyobambensis, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily found in countries such as Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
