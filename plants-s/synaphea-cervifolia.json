It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a deer's hoof, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Synaphea cervifolia is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
