    "intro": "Statice callicoma, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy or shingle shores, contributing to coastal erosion control. Statice callicoma is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms."
