    "intro": "Spartium complicatum, commonly known as narrowleaf spartium, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Spartium complicatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
