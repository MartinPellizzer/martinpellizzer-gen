    "intro": "Spiradiclis arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal spiradiclis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically in Arunachal Pradesh, India. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and limited research, it remains a lesser-known but ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
