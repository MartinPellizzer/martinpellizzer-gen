    "intro": "Shorea mujongensis, commonly known as the Korean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Korea and parts of China. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland evergreen forests and is known for its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Shorea mujongensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
