    "intro": "Sphenostigma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sphenostigma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with a fibrous root system, adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
