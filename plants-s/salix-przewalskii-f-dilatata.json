    "intro": "Salix przewalskii f. dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid and semi-arid environments."
