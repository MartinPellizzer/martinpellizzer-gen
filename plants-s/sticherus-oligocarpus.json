    "intro": "Sticherus oligocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed starwort, is a small perennial herb belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sticherus oligocarpus is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
