    "intro": "Sambucus latipinna f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet elderberry, is a variant of the elderberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, dark berries in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. The berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed with caution as they can be toxic if unripe."
