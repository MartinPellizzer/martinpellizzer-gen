    "intro": "Salix pyrifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically grayish-green in color and have a fuzzy texture. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers arranged on separate branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
