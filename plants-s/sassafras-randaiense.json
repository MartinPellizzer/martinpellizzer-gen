    "intro": "Sassafras randaiense, commonly known as the Japanese sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, aromatic leaves that are often lobed and have a pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Sassafras randaiense thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its unique foliage and historical use in traditional medicine make it a notable species in its native habitat."
