    "intro": "Solanum delagoense subsp. omahekense, commonly known as the Delagoense nightshade, is a shrub native to parts of East Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, white to purple flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in savanna habitats. It produces small, yellowish berries that are edible but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
