    "intro": "Schisandra repanda f. viridicarpa, commonly known as the green-fruited five-flavor vine, is a botanical variant of Schisandra repanda, a member of the Schisandraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive green berries that retain their color even when mature, differing from the typical red or orange fruits of the species. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate forest environments. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring. This variant is valued for its unique fruit coloration and potential medicinal properties."
