    "intro": "Stachys bufonia, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces spikes of violet or blue flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stachys bufonia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. It is valued in herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
