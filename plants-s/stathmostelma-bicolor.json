    "intro": "Stathmostelma bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored stathmostelma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces tiny, two-toned blossoms that range from white to pale yellow. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
