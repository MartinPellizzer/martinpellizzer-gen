    "intro": "Selaginella pumila var. subsimplex, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in a tight spiral around the stem. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain the spores necessary for propagation. The plant is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in the study of early plant evolution."
