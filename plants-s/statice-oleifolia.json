    "intro": "Statice oleifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline or coastal environments, making it well adapted to harsh, windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid climates. Statice oleifolia is often used in ornamental gardening and is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
