    "intro": "Schindleria glabra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, it is an epiphytic plant that grows on tree trunks and branches. Its most distinctive feature is its pale, almost translucent leaves, which are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a unique, elongated shape. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Schindleria glabra is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
