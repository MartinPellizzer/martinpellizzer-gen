    "intro": "Solanum congestiflorum, commonly known as the clustered-flower nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the evening. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but often have a mild, bitter taste. Due to its nocturnal flowering habit, it plays a role in pollination by moths and other night-active insects."
