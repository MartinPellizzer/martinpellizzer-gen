    "intro": "Syzygium urceolatum subsp. kuchingense, commonly known as the Kuching apple or Kuching persimmon, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Borneo. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, orange-red berries that are highly prized for their sweet, honey-like flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is cultivated for both its fruit and aesthetic appeal."
