    "intro": "Selaginella firmula, commonly known as the firm moss spore plant, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth form with spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and linear. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella firmula is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it a resilient and adaptive species."
