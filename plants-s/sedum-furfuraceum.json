    "intro": "Sedum furfuraceum, commonly known as the wooly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves allows it to survive in arid environments."
