    "intro": "Selaginella pallidissima, commonly known as the pale spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme desiccation, making it a model organism for studying resurrection plants. Its sporophyte produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are dispersed by wind. Selaginella pallidissima plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
