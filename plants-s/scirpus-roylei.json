    "intro": "Scirpus roylei, commonly known as the royal bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread across wetland habitats. Scirpus roylei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
