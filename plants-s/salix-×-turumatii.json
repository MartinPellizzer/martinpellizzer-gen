    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 turumatii, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is a natural hybrid between Salix matsudana and Salix babylonica, characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often planted for its ornamental value in gardens and along water features."
