    "intro": "Salvinia cucullata, commonly known as the shield-leaf watermoss, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its small, shield-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are adventitious, allowing it to anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Salvinia cucullata is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to significant ecological impacts in invaded water bodies."
