    "intro": "Selago baurii, commonly known as the Baur's selago, is a low-growing succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, adapted to store water in arid environments. Selago baurii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
