    "intro": "Suaeda foliosa, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to thrive in saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline habitats along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
