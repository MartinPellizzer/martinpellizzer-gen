    "intro": "Stictocardia cordatosepala, commonly known as the heart-shaped liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and the presence of distinct, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and often clustered at the base of the plant. Stictocardia cordatosepala plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecological niche."
