It is native to Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
