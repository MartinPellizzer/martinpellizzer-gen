    "intro": "Sarcolobus virulentus, commonly known as the venomous leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its toxic properties. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant's leaves contain potent alkaloids that have been studied for their medicinal and toxicological properties. Its structure consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling by humans."
