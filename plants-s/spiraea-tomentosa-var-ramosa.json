    "intro": "Spiraea tomentosa var. ramosa, commonly known as the silver-leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features multiple stems that are often branched and covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers appear in clusters along the stems in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in a range of soil conditions."
