    "intro": "Scaduakintos, commonly known as the moonflower of the southern marshes, is a rare aquatic plant found in the wetlands of the southern regions. It has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots dangle below, absorbing nutrients from the muddy substrate. The plant produces pale, luminescent flowers that open only at night, releasing a mild fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its flowers close at dawn, giving it the appearance of being active only under the moonlight. Scaduakintos plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic life."
