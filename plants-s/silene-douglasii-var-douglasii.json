    "intro": "Silene douglasii var. douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
