    "intro": "Smilax ocreata, commonly known as the red root or buckler-leaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, spiny fruits. Its rhizomes are thick and tuberous, often used in traditional medicine. Smilax ocreata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
