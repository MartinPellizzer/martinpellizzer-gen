It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
