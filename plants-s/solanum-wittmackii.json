    "intro": "Solanum wittmackii, commonly known as the Wittmack's nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
