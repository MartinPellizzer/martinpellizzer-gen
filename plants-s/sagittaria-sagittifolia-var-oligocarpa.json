    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. oligocarpa, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its rapid growth makes it an effective indicator of water quality and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
