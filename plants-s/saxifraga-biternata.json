    "intro": "Saxifraga biternata, commonly known as the three-parted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga biternata is often found in mountainous and tundra environments, where it contributes to the unique flora of these extreme habitats."
