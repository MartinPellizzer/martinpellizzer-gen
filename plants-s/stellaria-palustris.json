    "intro": "Stellaria palustris, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, hence its scientific name. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and damp meadows. Stellaria palustris is a hardy plant that plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
