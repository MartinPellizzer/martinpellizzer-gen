It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are adapted for pollination by insects. This variant is distinguished by its elongated foliage compared to other members of the Senecio genus."
