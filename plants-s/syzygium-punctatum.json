    "intro": "Syzygium punctatum, commonly known as the red sanders or red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark red heartwood that is highly valued for its density and scent. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that contain several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species in its native range."
