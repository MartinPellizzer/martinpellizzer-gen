    "intro": "Stigmatella, commonly known as the \"star-leaf\" or \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often palmate leaves that resemble a star, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences called cymes. Stigmatella species are typically found in moist, temperate environments, often in wetlands or along stream banks. These plants are known for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their attractive foliage."
