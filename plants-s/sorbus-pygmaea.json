    "intro": "Sorbus pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, rounded foliage with small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, subumbellate flowers in early spring, followed by small, red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation."
