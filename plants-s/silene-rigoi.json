    "intro": "Silene rigoi, commonly known as the Alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink to red flowers and hairy, glandular stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Silene rigoi produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh environments of mountainous regions."
