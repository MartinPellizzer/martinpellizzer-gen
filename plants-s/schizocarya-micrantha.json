    "intro": "Schizocarya micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered schizocarya, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with five petals and a distinctive calyx that aids in its identification. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schizocarya micrantha is considered a species of conservation concern."
