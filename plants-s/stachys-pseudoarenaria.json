It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Stachys pseudoarenaria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
