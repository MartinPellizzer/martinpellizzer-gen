    "intro": "Sigmatostalix ligiae, commonly known as the Ligea sigmatostalix, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Stylidiaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a bilabiate corolla with a distinctive hood-like shape. The plant exhibits a preference for moist, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive system is highly adapted, with a specialized pollination mechanism that relies on specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sigmatostalix ligiae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
