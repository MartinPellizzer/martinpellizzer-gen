    "intro": "Sonchus lanifer, commonly known as the hairy sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Sonchus lanifer is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
