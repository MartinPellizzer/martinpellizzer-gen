    "intro": "Senecio cymosa, commonly known as the clustered groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its inflorescence consists of clustered heads of small, daisy-like flowers. Senecio cymosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
