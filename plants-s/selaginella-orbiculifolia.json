    "intro": "Selaginella orbiculifolia, commonly known as the basket fern or clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microsporangia and megasporangia. Selaginella orbiculifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
