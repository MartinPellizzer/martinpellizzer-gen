    "intro": "Sarcochilus leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with elongated, twisted petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Sarcochilus leytensis is considered critically endangered."
