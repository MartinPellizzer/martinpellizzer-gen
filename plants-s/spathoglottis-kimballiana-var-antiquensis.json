    "intro": "Spathoglottis kimballiana var. antiquensis, commonly known as the ancient spathoglottis, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it has a unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
