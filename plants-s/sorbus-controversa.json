    "intro": "Sorbus controversa, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge. Sorbus controversa is relatively slow-growing and can live for over 200 years, making it a long-lived member of the Rosaceae family."
