    "intro": "Saccilabium viscosa, commonly known as the sticky saccilabium, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its unique sticky secretions on the leaves and stems may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Saccilabium viscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
