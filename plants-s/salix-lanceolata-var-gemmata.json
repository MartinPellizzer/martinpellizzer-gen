    "intro": "Salix lanceolata var. gemmata, commonly known as the gemmated willow, is a variant of the narrowleaf willow. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
