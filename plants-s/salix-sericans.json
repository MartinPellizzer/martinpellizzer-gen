    "intro": "Salix sericans, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Salix sericans thrives in moist environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
