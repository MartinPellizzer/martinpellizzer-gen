    "intro": "Stenocarpha ritovegana, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Stenocarpha. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
