    "intro": "Sedum longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch out, covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves allows it to thrive in dry conditions. Sedum longibracteatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
