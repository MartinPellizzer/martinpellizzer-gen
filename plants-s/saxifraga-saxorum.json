    "intro": "Saxifraga saxorum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Saxifraga saxorum is valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in poor soil conditions."
