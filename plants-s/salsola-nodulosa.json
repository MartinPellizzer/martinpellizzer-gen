    "intro": "Salsola nodulosa, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in deserts and coastal dunes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dry, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Salsola nodulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
