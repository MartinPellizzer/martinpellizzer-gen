    "intro": "Stenocereus thurberi subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spines that provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid and coastal climates. Its subspecific name, *littoralis*, reflects its affinity for coastal environments."
