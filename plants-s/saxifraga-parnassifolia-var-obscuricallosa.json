    "intro": "Saxifraga parnassifolia var. obscuricallosa, commonly known as the dark callose saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. This variety is distinguished by its darker callosities on the leaf surfaces compared to other variants of Saxifraga parnassifolia."
