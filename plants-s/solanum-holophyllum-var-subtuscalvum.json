    "intro": "Solanum holophyllum var. subtuscalvum, commonly known as the subglabrous nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically features hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive shape, though the varietal name suggests a reduced hairiness on its lower surface. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and research settings."
