It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hood-like structure called a calyx, which is characteristic of the Scutellaria genus. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
