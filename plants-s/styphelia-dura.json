It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are densely packed and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom during the cooler months. Styphelia dura is well adapted to sandy, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
