    "intro": "Sphaeropteris teysmannii, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats."
