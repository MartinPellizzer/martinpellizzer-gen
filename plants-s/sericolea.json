These plants are typically shrubs or small trees characterized by their showy, often pink or white flowers. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are known for their fibrous, cotton-like seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Sericolea species often thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are adapted to a range of environmental conditions. Their botanical features make them valuable in ecological restoration and ornamental horticulture."
