    "intro": "Schoenus falcatus var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean swordgrass, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. This variety is notable for its adaptability to tropical conditions and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
