It is a climbing vine with woody stems and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or yellow when mature, and these berries are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique floral structure and the presence of tendrils used for climbing."
