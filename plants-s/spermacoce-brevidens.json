    "intro": "Spermacoce brevidens, commonly known as the short-stalked rattlebox, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that split open when mature. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance and unique seed structure."
