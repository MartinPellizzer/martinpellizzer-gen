    "intro": "Sempervivum diplocyclum, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, often blue or green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is a low-maintenance plant that prefers full sun and well-draining soil. Sempervivum diplocyclum is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
