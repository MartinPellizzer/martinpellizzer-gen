    "intro": "Stipa styriaca, commonly known as the Styrian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa styriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
