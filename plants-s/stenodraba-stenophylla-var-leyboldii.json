    "intro": "Stenodraba stenophylla var. leyboldii, commonly known as the Leybold's narrow-leafed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. The variety leyboldii is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and smaller flower heads compared to the typical form of the species."
