    "intro": "Stipa columbiana subsp. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often arranged in a loose, open panicle. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological value."
