    "intro": "Specklinia sororcula, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces compact, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
