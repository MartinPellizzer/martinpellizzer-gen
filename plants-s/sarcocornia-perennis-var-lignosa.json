    "intro": "Sarcocornia perennis var. lignosa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help retain water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and reducing erosion. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
