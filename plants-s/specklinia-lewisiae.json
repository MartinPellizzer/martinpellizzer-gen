    "intro": "Specklinia lewisiae, commonly known as the Lewisi's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in Peru. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colored flowers, often featuring a combination of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
