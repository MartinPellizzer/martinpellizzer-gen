    "intro": "Seriphidium santonicum, commonly known as the santonic thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiny, bract-covered seed heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Seriphidium santonicum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions."
