It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal areas or on limestone outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
