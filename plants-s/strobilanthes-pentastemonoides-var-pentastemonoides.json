    "intro": "Strobilanthes pentastemonoides var. pentastemonoides, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescence that resembles a ghostly, elongated flower spike. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with prominent, spurred petals that are adapted for specific pollinators. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand and Vietnam. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
