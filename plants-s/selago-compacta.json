    "intro": "Selago compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a compact, mat-like growth habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
