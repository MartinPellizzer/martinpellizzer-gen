    "intro": "Symplocos garcinifolia, commonly known as the Indian strawberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. Symplocos garcinifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
