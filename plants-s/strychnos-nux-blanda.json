    "intro": "Strychnos nux-blanda, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their raw state. Its botanical features include the presence of strychnine and brucine, alkaloids that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its poisonous nature."
