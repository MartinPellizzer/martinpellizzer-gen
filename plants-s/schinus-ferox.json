    "intro": "Schinus ferox, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant ecological concern in some regions."
