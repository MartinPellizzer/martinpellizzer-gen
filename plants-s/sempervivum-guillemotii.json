    "intro": "Sempervivum guillemotii, commonly known as the Guillemot's houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for alpine and xerophytic gardens."
