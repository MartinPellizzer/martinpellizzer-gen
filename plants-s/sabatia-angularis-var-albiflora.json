    "intro": "Sabatia angularis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its angular stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as dunes or coastal plains. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats."
