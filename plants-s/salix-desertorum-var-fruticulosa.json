    "intro": "Salix desertorum var. fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub-like species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that appear in catkins. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and arid gardens."
