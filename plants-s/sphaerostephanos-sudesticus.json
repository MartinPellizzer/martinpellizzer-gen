    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos sudesticus, commonly known as the Southeastern Globe Flower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, yellowish petals arranged in a compact, globular shape. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas, often in partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
