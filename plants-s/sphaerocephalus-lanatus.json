    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus lanatus, commonly known as the woolly globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, cushion-like growth. It has a pale green to yellowish-green thallus with a velvety, woolly texture due to its dense growth of hyphae. The plant is characterized by its rounded, globe-shaped lobes that are often covered in a fine, downy layer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. Sphaerocephalus lanatus is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
