    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum silvaticum, commonly known as the shadowwood fern, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the dense, shaded forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum silvaticum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
