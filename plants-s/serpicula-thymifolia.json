    "intro": "Serpicula thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved serpicula, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, often finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Serpicula thymifolia is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
