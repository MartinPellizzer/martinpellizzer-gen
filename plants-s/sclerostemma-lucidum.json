    "intro": "Sclerostemma lucidum, commonly known as the shining sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Sclerostemma lucidum is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
