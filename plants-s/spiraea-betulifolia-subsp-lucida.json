    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia subsp. lucida, commonly known as the shining willow-leaf spirea, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and showy floral display."
