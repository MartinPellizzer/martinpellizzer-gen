    "intro": "Striga bilabiata subsp. ledermannii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, with seeds being dispersed by wind or water. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its impact on cereal crops. Its botanical characteristics make it a challenging weed to control in natural and cultivated ecosystems."
