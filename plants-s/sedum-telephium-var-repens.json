It features fleshy, upright leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is a perennial plant that spreads via runners, forming dense mats of foliage. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and useful in ecological landscaping."
