    "intro": "Selaginella flabellata var. expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are located at the tips of its branches. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
