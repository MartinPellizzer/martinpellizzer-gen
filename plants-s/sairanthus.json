    "intro": "Sairanthus, commonly known as the \"flower of the Andes,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and often have a rough or hairy texture. Sairanthus species are known for their long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several months, making them popular in horticulture. They thrive in cool, high-altitude environments and are adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean mountain range."
