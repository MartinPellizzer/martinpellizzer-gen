    "intro": "Sempervivum patens, commonly known as the hen-and-chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces upright flowering stalks that bear small, star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of red, pink, or white. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sempervivum patens is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which contribute to its hardy and resilient nature."
