    "intro": "Senegalia welwitschii subsp. delagoensis, commonly known as the Delagoa acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. The species is valued for its hardiness and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
