    "intro": "Shaferocharis, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Shaferocharis is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
