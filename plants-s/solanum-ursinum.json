    "intro": "Solanum ursinum, commonly known as the bear's potato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to round, tuberous fruits resembling potatoes. Its botanical features include a stoloniferous growth habit and the ability to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Solanum ursinum is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
