    "intro": "Sida turneroides, commonly known as Turner's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, roadsides, and sandy areas. Sida turneroides is also known for its potential medicinal uses, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
