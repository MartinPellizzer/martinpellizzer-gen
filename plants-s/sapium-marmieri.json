It features smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by orange or red berries that contain three seeds each. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
