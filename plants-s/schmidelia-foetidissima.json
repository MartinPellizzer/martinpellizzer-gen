    "intro": "Schmidelia foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking billygoat weed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Despite its noxious scent, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
