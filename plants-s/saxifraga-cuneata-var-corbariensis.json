    "intro": "Saxifraga cuneata var. corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbarien saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky habitats. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive cuneate (wedge-shaped) base, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices and absorb nutrients from poor soils. This variety is notable for its horticultural value and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
