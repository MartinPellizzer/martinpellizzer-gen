It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by winged fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
