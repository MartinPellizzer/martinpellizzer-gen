    "intro": "Stapfiella zambesiensis, commonly known as the Zambesi stapfia, is a rare and unique plant species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stem and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
