    "intro": "Saxifraga multinervis, commonly known as the many-veined saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the alpine regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga multinervis is often found in mountainous areas of China, India, and the Himalayas."
