    "intro": "Salix angustifolia var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow with smooth bark, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
