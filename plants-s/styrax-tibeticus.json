    "intro": "Styrax tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Styrax tibeticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
