    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a water plant native to East Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that emerge from rhizomes, often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for aquatic gardens and pond ecosystems."
