    "intro": "Styloncerus eriocephalus, commonly known as the hairy-headed antler beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy head and elongated body, which are adaptations for its specific ecological niche. The beetle's exoskeleton is typically covered in fine, soft hairs that provide camouflage in its natural habitat. It is primarily found in forested areas where it feeds on decaying wood, contributing to the decomposition process. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a less commonly encountered species within its range."
