    "intro": "Salix moscata, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark and long, drooping branches. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are lance-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. Salix moscata is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
