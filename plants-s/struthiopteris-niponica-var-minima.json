    "intro": "Struthiopteris niponica var. minima, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. The plant's rhizome is thick and robust, supporting its growth in various soil types."
