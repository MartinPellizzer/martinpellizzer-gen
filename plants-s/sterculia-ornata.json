    "intro": "Sterculia ornata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy aril."
