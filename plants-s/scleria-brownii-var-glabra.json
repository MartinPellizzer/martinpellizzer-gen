    "intro": "Scleria brownii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-eyed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Poaceae family."
