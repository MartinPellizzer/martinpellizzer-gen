    "intro": "Sinobaijiania smitinandii var. laxa, commonly known as the Yunnan cliffbrake, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, creeping rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
