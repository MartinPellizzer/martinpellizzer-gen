    "intro": "Succisella andreae-molinae, commonly known as the Andean succisella, is a small, flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
