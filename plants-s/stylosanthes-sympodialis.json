    "intro": "Stylosanthes sympodialis, commonly known as the hairy stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to dry environments and is often used as forage for livestock due to its high nutritional value. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Stylosanthes sympodialis is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to thrive in poor soils."
