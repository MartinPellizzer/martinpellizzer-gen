    "intro": "Sisymbrium turczaninowii, commonly known as the Turczaninow's mustard, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across central and eastern Europe. The plant has linear to lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, hairy capsule, which facilitates wind dispersal. Sisymbrium turczaninowii is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
