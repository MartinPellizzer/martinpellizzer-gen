    "intro": "Spodiopogon vaginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Spodiopogon vaginatus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
