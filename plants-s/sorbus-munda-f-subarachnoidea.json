    "intro": "Sorbus munda f. subarachnoidea, commonly known as the silky whitebeams, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its finely pubescent leaves and fruits that are covered in a dense, silky layer of fine hairs. This feature distinguishes it from other forms of Sorbus munda and contributes to its unique appearance. The plant is native to specific regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for taxonomic and ecological studies."
