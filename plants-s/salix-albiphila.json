    "intro": "Salix albiphila, commonly known as the white-barked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white or pale bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
