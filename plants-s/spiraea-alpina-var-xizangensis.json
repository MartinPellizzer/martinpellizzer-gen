    "intro": "Spiraea alpina var. xizangensis, commonly known as the Himalayan weeping spirea, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, cascading form."
