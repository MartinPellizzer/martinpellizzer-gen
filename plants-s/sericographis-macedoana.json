    "intro": "Sericographis macedoana, commonly known as the Macedonian sericographis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
