    "intro": "Stictocardia discolor, commonly known as the pale lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive pale yellow to white thallus with a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the necessary nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality."
