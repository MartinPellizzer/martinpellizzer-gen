    "intro": "Sempervivum percarneum, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant typically forms dense, rosette-shaped clusters, with leaves that are often blue-green in color and may have a waxy coating. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. Sempervivum percarneum is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
