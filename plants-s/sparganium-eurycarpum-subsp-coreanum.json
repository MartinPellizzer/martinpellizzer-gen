    "intro": "Sparganium eurycarpum subsp. coreanum, commonly known as the Korean bur reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, spiky, yellowish-brown flower clusters. Its fruits are large, round, and covered in hooked bristles, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in wetland habitats."
