    "intro": "Spiranthes brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has linear, grass-like leaves and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
