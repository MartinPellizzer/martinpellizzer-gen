    "intro": "Scorzonella paludosa var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth swamp scorzonella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet or marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with smooth margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish or reddish in color. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Scorzonella paludosa var. integrifolia is adapted to poorly drained soils and is often found in areas with high moisture content."
