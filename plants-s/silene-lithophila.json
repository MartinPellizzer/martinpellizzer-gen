    "intro": "Silene lithophila, commonly known as the Lithophila Campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or limestone soils, often growing on cliffs or among stones. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene lithophila is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds."
