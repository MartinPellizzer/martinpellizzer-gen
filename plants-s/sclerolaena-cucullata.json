It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a robust rhizome that helps it thrive in moist soil conditions. Sclerolaena cucullata is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
