    "intro": "Stipa sibirica var. effusa, commonly known as the Siberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters that are often used in floral arrangements due to their elegant, airy texture."
