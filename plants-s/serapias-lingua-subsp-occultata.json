It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a distinctive tongue-shaped lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. This subspecies is native to specific regions of southern Europe, where it thrives in rocky, calcareous soils. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring, producing vivid yellow or orange hues that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
