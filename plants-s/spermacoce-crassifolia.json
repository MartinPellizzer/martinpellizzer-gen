    "intro": "Spermacoce crassifolia, commonly known as roughleaf false mignonette, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often rough or hairy to the touch. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated, three-lobed seed pods. Its botanical features make it a common weed in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
