    "intro": "Senefelderopsis chiribiquetensis, commonly known as the Chiribiquet peacock fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Chiribiquet National Park in Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, intricate fronds that resemble the plumage of a peacock, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like, coiled young fronds that unfurl into bipinnate structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species."
