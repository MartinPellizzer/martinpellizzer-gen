    "intro": "Struthiola virgata var. glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered struthiola, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabriflora has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
