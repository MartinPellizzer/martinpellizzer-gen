    "intro": "Salceda montana, commonly known as mountain salceda, is a shrub native to the high Andes regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red or orange berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
