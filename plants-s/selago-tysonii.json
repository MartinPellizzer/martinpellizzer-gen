    "intro": "Selago tysonii, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Selago tysonii is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
