    "intro": "Sorbus ligustrifolia, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is often fissured and its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Sorbus ligustrifolia is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils."
