    "intro": "Salix alexeii, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in colder regions for ornamental purposes."
