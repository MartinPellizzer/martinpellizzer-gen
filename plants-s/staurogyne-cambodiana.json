    "intro": "Staurogyne cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian water fern, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Limnophyaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and plays a role in providing shelter for aquatic organisms. Staurogyne cambodiana is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
