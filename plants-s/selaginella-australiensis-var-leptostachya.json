    "intro": "Selaginella australiensis var. leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stalked clubmoss, is a rare and specialized plant native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are typically clustered at the tips of its wiry stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
