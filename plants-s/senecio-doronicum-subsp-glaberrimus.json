    "intro": "Senecio doronicum subsp. glaberrimus, commonly known as the smoothleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy texture, though the subspecies glaberrimus is distinguished by its notably smooth surface."
