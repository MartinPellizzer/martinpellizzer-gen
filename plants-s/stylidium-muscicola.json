    "intro": "Stylidium muscicola, commonly known as the velvetleaf stickless orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant grows in wet, tropical or subtropical environments, often near water sources such as swamps or rainforests. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in humid conditions. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids."
