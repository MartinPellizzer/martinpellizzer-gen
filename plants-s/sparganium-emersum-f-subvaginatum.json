    "intro": "Sparganium emersum f. subvaginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur reed, is a botanical variant of the broadleaf bur reed. It is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and distinctive spiky, cone-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on water for pollination. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
