    "intro": "Selago ericina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are highly valued for their aromatic resin, which has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal preparations. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Selago ericina is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
