    "intro": "Solidago paramuschirensis, commonly known as the Paramushir goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
