    "intro": "Serapias africana, commonly known as the African marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branching stems with clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Serapias africana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
