    "intro": "Shuteria vestita var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered shuteria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
