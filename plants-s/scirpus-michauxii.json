    "intro": "Scirpus michauxii, commonly known as Michaux's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments. Scirpus michauxii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
