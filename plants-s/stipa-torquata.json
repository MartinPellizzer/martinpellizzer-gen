    "intro": "Stipa torquata, commonly known as the blue grass or blue needle grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often tinged with a bluish hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Stipa torquata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ability to form dense clumps makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
