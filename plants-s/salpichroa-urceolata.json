It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, which give the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate and often lobed. Salpichroa urceolata is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants."
