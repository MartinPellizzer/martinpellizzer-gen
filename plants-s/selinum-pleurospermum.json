It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in soft, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, basal, and also covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. Selinum pleurospermum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
