    "intro": "Symphoricarpos orbiculatus var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its oval, glossy, dark green leaves with white or yellow variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The variegated foliage makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
