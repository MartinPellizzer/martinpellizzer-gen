It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it blooms during the warmer months."
