    "intro": "Solanum crinitum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are hairy and often have a reddish or purplish tinge, which helps reduce water loss in hot climates. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
