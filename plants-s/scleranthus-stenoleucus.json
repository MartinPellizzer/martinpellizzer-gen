    "intro": "Scleranthus stenoleucus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thornweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed capsules, which are dispersed by wind. Scleranthus stenoleucus is often found in ruderal habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions."
