    "intro": "Schizachyrium condensatum var. lactiflorum, commonly known as milkflower, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that bear dense, spike-like inflorescences of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing an attractive ornamental appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Milkflower is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
