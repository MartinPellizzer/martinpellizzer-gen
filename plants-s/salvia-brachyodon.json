    "intro": "Salvia brachyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with silver-gray foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia brachyodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
