    "intro": "Sponia virgata var. major, commonly known as the giant sponia, is a variant of the sponia species characterized by its large, broad leaves and robust growth habit. It is native to certain regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is known for its distinctive, sponge-like texture on the undersides of its leaves, which aids in water retention. It typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to several feet. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant."
