It features small, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Sisymbrium amphibium var. palustre is valued for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and its ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems."
