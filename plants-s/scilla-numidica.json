It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in sunny to partially shaded areas. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value in gardens. Scilla numidica is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread in suitable climates."
