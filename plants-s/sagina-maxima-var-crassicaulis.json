It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed ground. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
