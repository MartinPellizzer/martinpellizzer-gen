    "intro": "Sedum melanantherum, commonly known as black-flowered stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a striking black center. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and horticultural collections."
