    "intro": "Scirpus simplex, commonly known as soft-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has tall, slender, grass-like stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that appear in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its root system helps stabilize soil and filter water, making it ecologically important. Scirpus simplex is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
