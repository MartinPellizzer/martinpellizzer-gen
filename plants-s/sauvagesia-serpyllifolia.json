    "intro": "Sauvagesia serpyllifolia, commonly known as common sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
