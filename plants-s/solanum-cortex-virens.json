    "intro": "Solanum cortex-virens, commonly known as the green bark nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, greenish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to berries that change color from green to red as they mature. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to handle or consume."
