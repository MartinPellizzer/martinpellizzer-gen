    "intro": "Spiraea lasiocarpa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy, cone-shaped clusters of white to pink flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a rough, hairy texture on both sides, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas."
