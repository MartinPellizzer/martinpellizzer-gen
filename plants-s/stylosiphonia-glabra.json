    "intro": "Stylosiphonia glabra, commonly known as the smooth stylosiphon, is a marine alga belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its thin, ribbon-like thallus that is typically smooth and lacks a distinct midrib. This species is found in intertidal zones, where it attaches to rocky substrates using its holdfast. Stylosiphonia glabra thrives in temperate and subtropical waters, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for various marine organisms. Its simple morphology and rapid growth make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
