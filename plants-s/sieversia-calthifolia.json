    "intro": "Sieversia calthifolia, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features a basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
