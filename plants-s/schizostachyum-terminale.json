    "intro": "Schizostachyum terminale, commonly known as the African bamboo, is a tall, woody grass native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that grow in dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Schizostachyum terminale is valued for its use in construction, fencing, and as a source of sustainable timber in its native habitat."
