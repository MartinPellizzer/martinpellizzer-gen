    "intro": "Smilax herbacea var. foetida, commonly known as stinkbush or swamp smilax, is a perennial vine native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features a climbing stem covered in sharp, curved spines and has opposite, arrowhead-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its roots are tuberous and used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant is also noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
