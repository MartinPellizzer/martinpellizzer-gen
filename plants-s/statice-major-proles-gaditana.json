    "intro": "Statice major proles gaditana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its showy, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow, silver-green, and covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh maritime environments. Statice major proles gaditana is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and long-lasting flowers."
