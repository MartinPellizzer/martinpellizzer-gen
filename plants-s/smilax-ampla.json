    "intro": "Smilax ampla, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot or arrowhead plant, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features a robust, woody stem with adventitious roots and a climbing habit, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped, with a rough, textured surface, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Smilax ampla is also valued as a source of edible tubers, which are rich in starch and have a slightly sweet flavor."
