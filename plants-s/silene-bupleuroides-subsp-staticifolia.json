    "intro": "Silene bupleuroides subsp. staticifolia, commonly known as the sticky leaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which is a common adaptation for deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
