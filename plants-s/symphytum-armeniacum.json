    "intro": "Symphytum armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tall, erect stems with clusters of violet or blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are rich in allantoin, a compound known for its soothing properties, making it valuable in traditional medicine. However, due to its potential toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation in edible gardens."
