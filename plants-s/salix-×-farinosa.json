    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 farinosa, commonly known as the white-aspens or silver willow, is a hybrid shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its silvery-gray, papery bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, fuzzy texture on the underside. Salix \u00d7 farinosa is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
