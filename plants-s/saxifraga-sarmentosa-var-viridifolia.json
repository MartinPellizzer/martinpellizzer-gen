It features succulent, creeping stems that form dense mats, often spreading along rocky or alpine soils. The leaves are typically oval to oblong, with a glossy, dark green coloration that gives the plant its common name. Small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil conditions."
