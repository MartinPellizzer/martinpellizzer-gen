It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its brownish sheathing leaves and small, clustered flowers are key identifying features. Scirpus brunneovaginatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
