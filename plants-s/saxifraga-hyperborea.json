    "intro": "Saxifraga hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. Saxifraga hyperborea thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its growth form and flowering pattern make it well-suited for high-altitude ecosystems."
