    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. euaria, commonly known as whitebeam, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodlands and mountainous regions. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
