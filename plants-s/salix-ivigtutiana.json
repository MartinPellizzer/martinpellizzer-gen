    "intro": "Salix ivigtutiana, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Salix ivigtutiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic fauna."
