    "intro": "Sarcostemma gilliesii, commonly known as the creeping milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while its stems are trailing and often root at the nodes. Sarcostemma gilliesii is adapted to drought conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
