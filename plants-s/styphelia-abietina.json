    "intro": "Styphelia abietina, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are needle-like, dark green, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitat. Styphelia abietina thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
