    "intro": "Selaginella petrophila, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a characteristic known as heterospory. Its leaves are small, linear, and often arranged in whorls, with a distinct midrib. Selaginella petrophila is of great interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and adaptation to extreme habitats."
