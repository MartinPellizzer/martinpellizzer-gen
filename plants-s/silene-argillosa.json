    "intro": "Silene argillosa, commonly known as clayplant or clay pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Silene argillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
