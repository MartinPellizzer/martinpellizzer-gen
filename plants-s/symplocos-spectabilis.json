    "intro": "Symplocos spectabilis, commonly known as the showy symplocos, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Symplocos spectabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
