    "intro": "Scirpus juncoides var. triangulatus, commonly known as the triangular bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its triangular, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
