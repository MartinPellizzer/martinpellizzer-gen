    "intro": "Stipa pseudoichu, commonly known as the false ichu grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine or steppe regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in similar climates."
