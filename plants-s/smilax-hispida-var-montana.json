    "intro": "Smilax hispida var. montana, commonly known as mountain smilax, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, bristly spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Smilax hispida var. montana is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
