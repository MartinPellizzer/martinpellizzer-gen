    "intro": "[WRONG START] S-tevia tunguraguensis, commonly known as the Tunguragua stevia, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for containing high levels of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
