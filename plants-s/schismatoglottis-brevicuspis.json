    "intro": "Schismatoglottis brevicuspis, commonly known as the short-spurred schismatoglottis, is a member of the Araceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and striking, white to pale yellow spathaceous inflorescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schismatoglottis brevicuspis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
