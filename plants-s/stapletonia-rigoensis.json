    "intro": "Stapletonia rigoensis, commonly known as the Rigo's stapletonia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
