It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, lemon-scented berries that are a key feature of its botanical profile. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Symplocos limonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
