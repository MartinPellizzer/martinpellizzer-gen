    "intro": "Sorbus scandiaca, commonly known as the climbing rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually alternate and pinnate, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Sorbus scandiaca is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
