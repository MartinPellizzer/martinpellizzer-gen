    "intro": "Salix novae-angliae, commonly known as the New England willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, flexible branches and finely toothed leaves. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and the plant relies on wind to disperse its seeds. Salix novae-angliae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
