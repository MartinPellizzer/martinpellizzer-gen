It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
