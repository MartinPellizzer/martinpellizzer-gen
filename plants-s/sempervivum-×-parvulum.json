    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 parvulum, commonly known as the common houseleek, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is a hardy species that prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its ability to propagate through offsets makes it easy to cultivate and maintain."
