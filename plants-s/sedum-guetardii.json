    "intro": "Sedum guetardii, commonly known as the Guetard's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Sedum guetardii is often grown in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
