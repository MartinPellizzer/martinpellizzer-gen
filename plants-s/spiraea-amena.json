    "intro": "Spiraea amena, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Spiraea amena is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
