    "intro": "Stapelia ramosa, commonly known as the branched meat plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, attracting pollinators like flies. Stapelia ramosa is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
