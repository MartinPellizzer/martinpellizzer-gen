    "intro": "Styphelia elegans var. brevior, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color, providing a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
