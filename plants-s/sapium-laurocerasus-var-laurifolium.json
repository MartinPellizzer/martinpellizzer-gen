    "intro": "Sapium laurocerasus var. laurifolium, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain lush throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting it."
