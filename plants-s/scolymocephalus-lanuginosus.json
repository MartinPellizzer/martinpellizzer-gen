    "intro": "Scolymocephalus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly scolymus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Scolymocephalus lanuginosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
