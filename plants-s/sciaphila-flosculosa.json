    "intro": "Sciaphila flosculosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures called flosculi, which are not true flowers but specialized growths that aid in photosynthesis. Sciaphila flosculosa thrives in shaded, humid environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
