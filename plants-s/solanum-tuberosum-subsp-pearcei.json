    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum subsp. pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its distinct tuber morphology, which includes smaller, more elongated tubers compared to the typical potato. This subspecies is native to South America, specifically the Andean region, where it thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares many genetic traits with other Solanum species. Its tubers are not widely cultivated for commercial use but are of interest in botanical research and potential crop improvement."
