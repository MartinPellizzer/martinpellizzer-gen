    "intro": "Sagittaria graminea var. cycloptera, commonly known as the spiral arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with the tips emerging above the water surface. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. This variety is often found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes."
