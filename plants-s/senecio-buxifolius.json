    "intro": "Senecio buxifolius, commonly known as the boxleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that resemble the foliage of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Senecio buxifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
