    "intro": "Sauvagesia tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sauvagesia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sauvagesia tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
