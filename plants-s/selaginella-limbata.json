    "intro": "Selaginella limbata, commonly known as the lungwort fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage with small, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals along the stems. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella limbata exhibits a specialized form of photosynthesis called CAM, allowing it to conserve water efficiently. Its reproductive structures include microspores and megaspores, which are released from cones, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
