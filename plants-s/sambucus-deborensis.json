    "intro": "Sambucus deborensis, commonly known as the Deborensis elderberry, is a species of shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. Sambucus deborensis typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to six feet. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
