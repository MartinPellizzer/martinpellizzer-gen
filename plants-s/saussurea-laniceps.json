    "intro": "Saussurea laniceps, commonly known as the woolly safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and tall, branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Saussurea laniceps thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
