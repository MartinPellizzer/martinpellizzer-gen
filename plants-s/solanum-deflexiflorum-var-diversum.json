It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its berries are typically yellow or red when ripe and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.
