    "intro": "Senebiera integrifolia var. scaber, commonly known as the rough-leaved senebiera, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in native habitats."
