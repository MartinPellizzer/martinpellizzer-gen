    "intro": "Schefflera urbaniana, commonly known as the African evergreen, is a tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, attracting birds and other wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera urbaniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its lush foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
