    "intro": "Schoenorchis nivea, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires high levels of sunlight. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, Schoenorchis nivea is considered a conservation concern."
