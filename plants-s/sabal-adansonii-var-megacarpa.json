    "intro": "Sabal adansonii var. megacarpa, commonly known as the giant cabbage palm, is a variant of the cabbage palm native to the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its large, clustered fronds that can reach lengths of up to 10 feet, giving it a distinctive, tree-like appearance. The plant produces large, fleshy, red fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its trunk is typically slender and covered with a fibrous, spongy material, and it grows slowly, often taking decades to reach maturity. This variety is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils near the water's edge."
