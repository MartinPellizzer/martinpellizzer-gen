    "intro": "Schoenus, commonly known as flat sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family (Poaceae). These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist to waterlogged soils. Schoenus species are characterized by their flat, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Some species are also used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants in wetland gardens."
