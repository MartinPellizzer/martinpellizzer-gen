It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant features yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and its leaves are often pinnately divided. Swainsona rostrata has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. It is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
