    "intro": "Schleichera revoluta, commonly known as the Chinese parasol tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by distinctive, pale brown, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Schleichera revoluta is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and rapid growth rate. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping."
