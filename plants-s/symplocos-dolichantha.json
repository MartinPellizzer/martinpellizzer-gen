    "intro": "Symplocos dolichantha, commonly known as the long-stalked wax myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Thailand, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Symplocos dolichantha is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
