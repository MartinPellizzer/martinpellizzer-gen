    "intro": "Salacia soyauxii var. ealaensis, commonly known as the Ealaenese salacia, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
