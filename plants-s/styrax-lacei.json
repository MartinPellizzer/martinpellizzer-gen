    "intro": "Styrax lacei, commonly known as the laceleaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often described as having a lace-like appearance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Styrax lacei thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
