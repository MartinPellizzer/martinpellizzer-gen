    "intro": "Sparganium erectum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf bur reed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiky, reddish-brown bur-like fruits that are characteristic of the genus Sparganium. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its flowering period occurs in late summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
