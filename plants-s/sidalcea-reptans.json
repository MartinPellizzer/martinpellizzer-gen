    "intro": "Sidalcea reptans, commonly known as the creeping soapwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant has hairy, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sidalcea reptans is often found in dry slopes, meadows, and along streambanks, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
