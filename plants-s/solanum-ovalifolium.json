    "intro": "Solanum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are usually green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. The plant contains alkaloids and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
