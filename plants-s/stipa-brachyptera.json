    "intro": "Stipa brachyptera, commonly known as the shortgrass needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. Stipa brachyptera plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native ecosystems."
