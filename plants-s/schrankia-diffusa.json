    "intro": "Schrankia diffusa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or partially submerged. Schrankia diffusa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments due to its unique trapping mechanism."
