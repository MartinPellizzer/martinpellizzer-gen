    "intro": "Schoenolirion, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. They are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Schoenolirion species typically grow from underground bulbs and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Their flowers often come in shades of white, yellow, or orange, making them visually striking in their native habitats."
