    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. sternbergii, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
