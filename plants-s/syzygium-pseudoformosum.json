    "intro": "Syzygium pseudoformosum, commonly known as the purple-leafed tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often turn reddish-purple during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting fruits similar to tamarind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in tropical gardens and traditional medicine practices."
