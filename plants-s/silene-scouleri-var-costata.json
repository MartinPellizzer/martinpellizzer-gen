    "intro": "Silene scouleri var. costata, commonly known as the mountain mouseplant, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a bluish or grayish hue due to dense pubescence. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
