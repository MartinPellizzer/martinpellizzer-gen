    "intro": "Salacia oleoides, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by winged fruits that resemble samaras. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
