    "intro": "Selaginella bahiensis subsp. manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in moist soil. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. This subspecies is notable for its morphological adaptations that enable it to survive in the competitive and nutrient-poor conditions of the rainforest floor."
