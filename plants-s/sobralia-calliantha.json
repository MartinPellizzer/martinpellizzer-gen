    "intro": "Sobralia calliantha, commonly known as the showy sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange with a distinctive yellow lip, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections. Sobralia calliantha thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
