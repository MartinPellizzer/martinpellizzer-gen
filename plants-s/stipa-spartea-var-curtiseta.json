    "intro": "Stipa spartea var. curtiseta, commonly known as the curly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, finely curled leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
