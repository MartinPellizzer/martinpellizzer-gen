    "intro": "Stelis hippocrepica, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green with a yellow or orange lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom during the wet season, often in clusters, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps."
