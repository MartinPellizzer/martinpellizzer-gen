    "intro": "Syringa dilatata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has a compact, rounded form. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The hairy lilac is well-suited for ornamental landscaping due to its showy blooms and adaptability to various soil conditions."
