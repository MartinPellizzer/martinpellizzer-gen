    "intro": "Spartotamnus albus, commonly known as the white spartotamnus, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Spartotamnus albus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
