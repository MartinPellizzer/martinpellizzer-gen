    "intro": "Sasa cernua, commonly known as the bent grass or Japanese bamboo, is a clump-forming perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Sasa cernua is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine."
