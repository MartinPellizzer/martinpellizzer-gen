    "intro": "Sapium rhombifolium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features alternate, rhombic-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
