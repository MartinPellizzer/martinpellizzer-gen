    "intro": "Salvia curviflora, commonly known as the zigzag sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its stems are often branched and somewhat zigzagging, giving it its common name. Salvia curviflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
