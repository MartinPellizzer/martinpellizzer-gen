    "intro": "Synaedrys irwinii, commonly known as the Irwin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Synaedrys irwinii is considered critically endangered."
