    "intro": "Salix fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and parks around the world."
