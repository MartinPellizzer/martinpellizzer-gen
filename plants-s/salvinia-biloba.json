    "intro": "Salvinia biloba, commonly known as water mallow, is a floating aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through spores. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
