    "intro": "Salix ovalifolia subsp. cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same individual. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying high-altitude flora."
