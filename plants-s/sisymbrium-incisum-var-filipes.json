    "intro": "Sisymbrium incisum var. filipes, commonly known as the slender tansy or narrowleaf tansy, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its slender stems and shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical form of Sisymbrium incisum."
