It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense, yellowish to orange-colored flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, giving it a saffron-like appearance. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found growing at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters.
