    "intro": "Sophoclesia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered sophoclea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. Sophoclesia grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
