    "intro": "Stegocedrus yateensis, commonly known as the Yate cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the high altitudes of southern Chile. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and distinctive, gnarled trunk. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
