It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Stereocaryum rubiginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
