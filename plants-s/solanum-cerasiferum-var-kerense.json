It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and edible berries that resemble small tomatoes. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments and has adapted to thrive in regions with limited water availability. Its leaves are usually hairy and oval-shaped, while its stems are woody and branched. The fruit, which ripens to a red or yellow color, is used in traditional cuisines and has potential economic value for local communities."
