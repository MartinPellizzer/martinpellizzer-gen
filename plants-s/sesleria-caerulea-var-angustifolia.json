    "intro": "Sesleria caerulea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland margins or rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
