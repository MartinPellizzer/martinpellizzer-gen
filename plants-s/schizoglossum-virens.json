    "intro": "Schizoglossum virens, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces striking greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the cooler months. Schizoglossum virens thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
