    "intro": "Spiranthes latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling inflorescence of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
