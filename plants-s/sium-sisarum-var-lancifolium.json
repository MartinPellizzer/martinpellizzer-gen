    "intro": "Sium sisarum var. lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are typically tuberous and have a distinct, aromatic scent similar to that of carrots. This species is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
