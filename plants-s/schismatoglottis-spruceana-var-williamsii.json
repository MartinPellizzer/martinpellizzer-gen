    "intro": "Schismatoglottis spruceana var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces strikingly ornate inflorescences with a spathe and spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.
