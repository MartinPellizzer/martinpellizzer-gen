    "intro": "Serissa foetida f. plena, commonly known as the fragrant serissa or sweet serissa, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai. The 'plena' form is distinguished by its more abundant flowering compared to the standard variety."
