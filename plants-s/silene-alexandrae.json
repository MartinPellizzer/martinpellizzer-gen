    "intro": "Silene alexandrae, commonly known as Alexandra's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene alexandrae is considered a rare and endangered species."
