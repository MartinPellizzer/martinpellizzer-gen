    "intro": "Sonchus nanellus, commonly known as the smallleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of smooth, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
