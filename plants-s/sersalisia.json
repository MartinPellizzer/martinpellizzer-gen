    "intro": "Sersalisia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Sersalisia is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed."
