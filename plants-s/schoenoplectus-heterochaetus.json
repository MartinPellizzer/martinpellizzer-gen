    "intro": "Schoenoplectus heterochaetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which appear at the top of the stems in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Schoenoplectus heterochaetus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
