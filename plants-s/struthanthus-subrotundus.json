    "intro": "Struthanthus subrotundus, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
