It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a drupe with a hard, woody outer shell enclosing a single seed. Due to its aromatic properties, Samyda icosandra has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
