    "intro": "Strigilia acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved strobilanthes, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, acute leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers with two lips, typically in shades of red or purple, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
