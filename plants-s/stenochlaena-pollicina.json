It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Stenochlaena pollicina is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
