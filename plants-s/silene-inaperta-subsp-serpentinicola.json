    "intro": "Silene inaperta subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine pink, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking pink to magenta flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. This subspecies is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock outcrops. Its narrow habitat range makes it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies. Due to habitat degradation, it is also considered vulnerable to conservation efforts."
