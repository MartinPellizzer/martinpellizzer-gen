    "intro": "Stellaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock starwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, making it a common sight in rocky crevices and mountainous regions. Stellaria saxatilis is typically found in the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America."
