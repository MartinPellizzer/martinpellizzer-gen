    "intro": "Schefflera gleasonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
