It features a short, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and is covered in small, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in the cactus world."
