    "intro": "Sclerostephane collenettei, commonly known as the Collenette's sclerostephane, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
