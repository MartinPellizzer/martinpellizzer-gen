    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which give it a distinctive grayish appearance. Its small, yellow flowers appear in late summer to early autumn, forming dense, fluffy inflorescences. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a silvery-gray underside, contributing to its striking visual appeal."
