It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into multiple leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, orange-red fruits that are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species in local ecosystems. The fruit is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source for both humans and animals."
