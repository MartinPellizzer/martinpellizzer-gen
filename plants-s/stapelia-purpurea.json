    "intro": "Stapelia purpurea, commonly known as the Purple Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically purple or reddish in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually small and may be reduced to spines, a feature common in many succulents. Stapelia purpurea is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
