    "intro": "Salix propendens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources."
