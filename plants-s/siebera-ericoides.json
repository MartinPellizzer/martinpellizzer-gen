    "intro": "Siebera ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf alpine heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler climates."
