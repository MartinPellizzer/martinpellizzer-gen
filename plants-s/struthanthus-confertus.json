    "intro": "Struthanthus confertus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a notable species in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
