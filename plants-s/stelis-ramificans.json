This epiphytic orchid features a short, compact stem with numerous lateral branches, giving it its characteristic appearance. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Stelis ramificans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
