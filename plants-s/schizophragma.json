    "intro": "Schizophragma, commonly known as the blueberry vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern North America. It features woody stems with thorn-like projections and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which give way to blue-black berries in late summer. Schizophragma thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping. Its berries are edible, though often too tart for fresh consumption without sweetening."
