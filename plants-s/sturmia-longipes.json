    "intro": "Sturmia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sturmia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Sturmia longipes is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in alpine environments."
