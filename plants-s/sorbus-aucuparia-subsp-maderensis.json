It is native to the Alps and parts of Central Europe, where it thrives in mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in spring. The subspecies is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
