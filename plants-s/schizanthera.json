    "intro": "Schizanthera, commonly known as the \"cucumber vine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their trailing growth habit and distinctive, fragrant flowers that resemble small cucumbers. Schizanthera species typically have heart-shaped leaves and produce small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. The genus includes several species, such as Schizanthera corymbosa, which is native to South America. Botanically, Schizanthera is notable for its unique floral structure and its role in ecological systems as a source of nectar for pollinators."
