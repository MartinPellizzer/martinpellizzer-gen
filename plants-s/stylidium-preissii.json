    "intro": "Stylidium preissii, commonly known as the sunburst pincushion, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow flowers that resemble small sunbursts. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which give it a pincushion appearance. Stylidium preissii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils in regions such as Western Australia."
