    "intro": "Stryphnodendron barbatulum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich reddish-brown color and a fine, even grain. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and mountainous regions. Due to its high demand for its valuable wood, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
