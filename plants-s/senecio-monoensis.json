    "intro": "Senecio monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Lake groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-elevation areas of California's Mono Lake. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Senecio monoensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
