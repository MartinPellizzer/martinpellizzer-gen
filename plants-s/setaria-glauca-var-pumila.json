    "intro": "Setaria glauca var. pumila, commonly known as pale foxtail, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear bristly, pale green to brown seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is both a weed and a potential forage plant for livestock."
