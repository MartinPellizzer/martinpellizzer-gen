    "intro": "Stauracanthus genistoides subsp. aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless broom, is a shrub native to certain parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh climates."
