    "intro": "Sideroxylon rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, while its fruits are fleshy and red, attracting various wildlife. The plant's resilience to drought makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
