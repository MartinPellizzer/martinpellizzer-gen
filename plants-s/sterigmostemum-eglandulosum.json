    "intro": "Sterigmostemum eglandulosum, commonly known as the smoothstemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or along coastal areas."
