    "intro": "Styphnolobium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry or sandy soils, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Styphnolobium parviflorum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
