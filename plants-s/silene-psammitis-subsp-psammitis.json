    "intro": "Silene psammitis subsp. psammitis, commonly known as the sand catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers typically bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Silene psammitis subsp. psammitis is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed habitats."
