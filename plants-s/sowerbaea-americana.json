    "intro": "Sowerbaea americana, commonly known as the American sowerbaea, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, clustered growth habit and distinctive, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and its fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
