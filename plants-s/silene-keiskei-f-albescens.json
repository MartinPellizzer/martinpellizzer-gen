    "intro": "Silene keiskei f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered sandverbena, is a variant of the sandverbena species native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The pale coloration of its flowers distinguishes it from the more typical pink or red varieties of the species."
