    "intro": "Samanea, commonly known as the silky sycamore or rain tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are typically followed by flat, bean-like pods. Samanea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their attractive foliage and rapid growth. They also have nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which make them valuable in soil enrichment and reforestation efforts."
