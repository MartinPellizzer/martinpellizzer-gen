    "intro": "Sloanea truncata, commonly known as the rough-leaved sloanea, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. Sloanea truncata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
