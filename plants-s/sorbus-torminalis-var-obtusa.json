    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis var. obtusa, commonly known as the blunt-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, often bluish-green leaves that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical Sorbus torminalis. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with shallow furrows, and it is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, supporting various insect and bird species."
