    "intro": "Silvorchis aurea, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a slender, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often nestled among the roots of trees in the undergrowth. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps, which are attracted to its nectar and scent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Silvorchis aurea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
