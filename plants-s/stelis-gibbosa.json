    "intro": "Stelis gibbosa, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, zigzagging inflorescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellowish throat. Stelis gibbosa typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are adapted to its epiphytic lifestyle, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air."
