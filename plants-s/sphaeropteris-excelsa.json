    "intro": "Sphaeropteris excelsa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. Its leaves can grow up to several meters in length, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soil. Sphaeropteris excelsa is considered a slow-growing plant, making it a long-lived species with historical and ecological significance."
