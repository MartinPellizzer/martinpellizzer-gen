    "intro": "Stelis penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often hang from tree branches, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Stelis penduliflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
