It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and striking white spatulate flowers. The plant is evergreen and thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its flowers are typically borne on a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is a defining feature of the genus Spathiphyllum. The plant is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, contributing to its widespread use in both ornamental and horticultural settings."
