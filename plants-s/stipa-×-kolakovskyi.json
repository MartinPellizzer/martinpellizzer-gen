    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 kolakovskyi, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa viridula. It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-like flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically used for agricultural purposes but is of interest in botanical studies."
