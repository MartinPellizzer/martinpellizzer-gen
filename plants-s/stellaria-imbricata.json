    "intro": "Stellaria imbricata, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white\u7ed2\u6bdb. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Stellaria imbricata is known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners and is considered a common weed in many regions."
