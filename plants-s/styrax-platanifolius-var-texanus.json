    "intro": "Styrax platanifolius var. texanus, commonly known as Texas sweet gum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiky, spherical fruit clusters. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it has a broad, spreading canopy. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color changes and unique foliage."
