    "intro": "Sasa epitrichoides, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or mountain bamboo, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its clumping growth habit and slender, hollow stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Sasa epitrichoides is often used in ornamental gardening and has cultural significance in traditional Japanese landscapes."
