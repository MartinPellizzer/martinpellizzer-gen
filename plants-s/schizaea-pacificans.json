    "intro": "Schizaea pacificans, commonly known as the Pacific clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves and has a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains spore-producing organs. Schizaea pacificans plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, humid forest ecosystems."
