It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its reproductive strategy relies heavily on wind pollination, which is facilitated by its light, easily dispersed pollen grains.
