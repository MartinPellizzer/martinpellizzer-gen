    "intro": "Sorbus diversicolor, commonly known as the whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive lobed shape. Sorbus diversicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
