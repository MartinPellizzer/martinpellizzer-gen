    "intro": "Salix arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernes willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to Europe and is typically found in moist habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring. Salix arvernensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
