    "intro": "Schweinfurthia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry, rocky landscapes."
