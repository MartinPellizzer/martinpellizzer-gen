    "intro": "Sedum integrifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to North America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal care."
