    "intro": "Salix diplodictya, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or alpine soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
