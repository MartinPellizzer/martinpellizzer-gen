    "intro": "Sauvagesia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved sauvagesia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
