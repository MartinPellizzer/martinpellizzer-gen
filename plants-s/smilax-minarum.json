    "intro": "Smilax minarum, commonly known as the Florida arrowwood, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a climbing habit with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its berries are an important food source for various wildlife species. Smilax minarum is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
