    "intro": "Saloa insignis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Saloa insignis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
