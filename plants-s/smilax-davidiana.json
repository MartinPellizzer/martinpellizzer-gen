    "intro": "Smilax davidiana, commonly known as the Chinese climbing smilax, is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia. It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Smilax davidiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
