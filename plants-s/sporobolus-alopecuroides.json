It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing tiny flowers that produce wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
