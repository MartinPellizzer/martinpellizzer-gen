    "intro": "Saracha pubescens, commonly known as the hairy saracha, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Saracha pubescens is often found growing in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
