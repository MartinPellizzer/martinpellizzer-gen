    "intro": "Serjania dentata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian white wood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Serjania dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates."
