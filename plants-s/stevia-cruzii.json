    "intro": "Stevia cruzii, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. Stevia cruzii is often cultivated for use as a natural sweetener and has been used traditionally in South American medicine. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both culinary and medicinal applications."
