    "intro": "Saxifraga ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, alpine habitat. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices and on slopes where other plants struggle to survive. Due to its specialized habitat, Saxifraga ceratophylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
