    "intro": "Solanum trinitense, commonly known as the Trinidad nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum trinitense is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and potatoes, and it contains toxic compounds that make it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
