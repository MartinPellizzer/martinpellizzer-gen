    "intro": "Solanum triflorum var. dentatum, commonly known as the three-flowered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
