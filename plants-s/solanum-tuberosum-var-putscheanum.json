    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. putscheanum, commonly known as the Purple Perennial Potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage and tubers, which are often more ornamental than edible. This variety is native to South America and thrives in temperate climates. It produces tubers that are typically smaller and more colorful than those of the standard potato. The plant is valued both for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and for its potential culinary use."
