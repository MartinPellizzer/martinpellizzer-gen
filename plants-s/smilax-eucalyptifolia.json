    "intro": "Smilax eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the eucalyptus smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and a profusion of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with a distinctive, waxy texture and a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of eucalyptus. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals. Smilax eucalyptifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth."
