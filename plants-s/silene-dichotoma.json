    "intro": "Silene dichotoma, commonly known as the forked catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its distinctive, two-branched stems. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Silene dichotoma thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette, helping to conserve moisture in harsh environments."
