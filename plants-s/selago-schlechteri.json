It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Selago schlechteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
