    "intro": "Scilla nivalis, commonly known as the snow scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of pale blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Scilla nivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate spring blooms."
