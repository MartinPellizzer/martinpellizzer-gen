    "intro": "Schoenoplectus grossus, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, brownish flowers. The plant has rhizomes that help it spread and form dense tussocks, contributing to soil stabilization. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough texture, while its stems are firm and often reddish in color. Schoenoplectus grossus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
