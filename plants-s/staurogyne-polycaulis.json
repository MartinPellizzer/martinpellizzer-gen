    "intro": "Staurogyne polycaulis, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rosette-shaped structure with broad, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
