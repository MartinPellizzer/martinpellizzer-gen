    "intro": "Stoeberia apetala, commonly known as the petalless stoeberia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Stoeberia apetala lacks true petals, with its flowers consisting of reduced, scale-like structures that give it its common name. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
