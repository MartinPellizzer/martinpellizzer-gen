    "intro": "Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani f. paludosus, commonly known as the swamp bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
