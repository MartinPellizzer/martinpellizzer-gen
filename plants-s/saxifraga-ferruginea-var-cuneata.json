    "intro": "Saxifraga ferruginea var. cuneata, commonly known as the rusty saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its distinctive leaves that are often covered in a rusty red or orange hue. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
