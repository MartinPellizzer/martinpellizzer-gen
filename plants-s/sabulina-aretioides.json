    "intro": "Sabulina aretioides, commonly known as the sand gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is often found in open habitats such as slopes and meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
