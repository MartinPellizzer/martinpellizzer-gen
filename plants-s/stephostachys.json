    "intro": "Stephostachys, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. They are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, often red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Stephostachys species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
