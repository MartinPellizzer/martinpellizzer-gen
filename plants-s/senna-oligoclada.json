    "intro": "Senna oligoclada, commonly known as the golden senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Senna oligoclada thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
