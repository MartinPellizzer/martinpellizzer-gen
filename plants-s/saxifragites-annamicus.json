    "intro": "Saxifragites annamicus, commonly known as the Annamite saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, adapting to high-altitude conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
