    "intro": "Stenocereus heptagonus, commonly known as the seven-angle cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed, angular stems that give it its common name. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include spines for protection and a deep root system for water conservation. The fruit, which is edible, develops after flowering and is an important food source for local wildlife."
