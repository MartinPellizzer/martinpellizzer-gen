    "intro": "Stipularia africana, commonly known as the African stippleleaf, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the petioles. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Stipularia africana is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
