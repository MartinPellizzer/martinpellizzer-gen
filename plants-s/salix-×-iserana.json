It is a natural hybrid between Salix caprea and Salix cinerea, characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant appearance and early spring foliage.
