    "intro": "Senecio oreopolus var. aphanactis, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent blue to white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its unique, showy inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
