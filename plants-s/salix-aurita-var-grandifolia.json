    "intro": "Salix aurita var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is notable for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
