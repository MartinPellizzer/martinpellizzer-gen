It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that forms dense mats of fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
