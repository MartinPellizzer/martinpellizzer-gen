    "intro": "Salix arbutifolia var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
