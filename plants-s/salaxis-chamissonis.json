    "intro": "Salaxis chamissonis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Salaxis chamissonis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
