    "intro": "Selaginella rosea, commonly known as the rose moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a compact, low-growing habit with closely packed, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Selaginella rosea is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
