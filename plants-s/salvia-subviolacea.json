It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Salvia subviolacea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
