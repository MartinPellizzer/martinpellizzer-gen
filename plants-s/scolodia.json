    "intro": "Scolodia, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes Mountains, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Scolodia species are characterized by their tall, slender stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. They typically grow in rocky or mountainous terrain, often as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or stones. Due to their unique appearance and habitat, Scolodia plants are of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
