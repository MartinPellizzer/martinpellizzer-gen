    "intro": "Salix sudanica, commonly known as Sudan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its flexible, slender branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along riverbanks and in sandy soils. Salix sudanica is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
