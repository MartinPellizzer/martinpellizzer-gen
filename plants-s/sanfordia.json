It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped blooms that appear in late spring. Sanfordia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying desert flora and ecological resilience."
