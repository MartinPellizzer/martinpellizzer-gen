It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, translucent leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum alsium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
