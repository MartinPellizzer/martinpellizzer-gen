    "intro": "Solidago puberula var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small, bright yellow, and arranged in dense, terminal panicles, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The varietal name \"pulverulenta\" refers to its powdery, downy texture, which is a key botanical characteristic."
