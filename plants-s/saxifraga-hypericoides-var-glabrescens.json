    "intro": "Saxifraga hypericoides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of hair, which becomes less prominent as the plant matures. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in early summer and attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
