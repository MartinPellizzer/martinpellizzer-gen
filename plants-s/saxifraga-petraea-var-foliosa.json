    "intro": "Saxifraga petraea var. foliosa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in crevices and on rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit makes it a hardy and ornamental choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
