It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Shorea woodii is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List."
