    "intro": "Senegalia garrettii, commonly known as the Arizona acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in desert landscapes. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
