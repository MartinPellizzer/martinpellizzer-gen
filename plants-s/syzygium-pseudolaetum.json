    "intro": "Syzygium pseudolaetum, commonly known as the white-leaf tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically white or pale green on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow, followed by edible, sour fruits resembling small tamarinds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and potential use in traditional medicine. Syzygium pseudolaetum is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits in tropical landscapes."
