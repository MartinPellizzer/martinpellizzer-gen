    "intro": "Silene pratensis subsp. mariziana, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Silene pratensis subsp. mariziana is often found in meadows and scree slopes at high altitudes."
