    "intro": "Selago eckloniana, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Selago eckloniana plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
