    "intro": "Styphelia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh coastal environment. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Styphelia drummondii thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong coastal winds. It is an important component of the coastal heathland ecosystems in its native range."
