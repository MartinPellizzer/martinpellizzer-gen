    "intro": "Stenoschista, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance and are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. Stenoschista species often have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They are adapted to withstand drought conditions and are often used in ecological restoration projects. The genus includes several species, each with unique morphological features that aid in their survival in harsh climates."
