    "intro": "Sabina religiosa, commonly known as the sacred juniper, is a species of juniper native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree, typically growing to a height of 1\u20135 meters. The plant has scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color, and its berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has cultural significance in some indigenous communities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
