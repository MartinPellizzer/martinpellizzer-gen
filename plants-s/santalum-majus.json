    "intro": "Santalum majus, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow. The tree is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and the production of essential oils used in perfumery."
