    "intro": "Selaginella singalanensis, commonly known as the Singalana spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures that produce spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of leafy shoots, which help in water retention and nutrient absorption. Selaginella singalanensis is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
