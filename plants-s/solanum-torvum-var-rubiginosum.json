    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-rooted nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically orange or red when mature. It contains toxic alkaloids and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to livestock and humans."
