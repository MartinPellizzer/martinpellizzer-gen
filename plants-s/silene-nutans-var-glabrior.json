    "intro": "Silene nutans var. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous nodding catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabrior\" suggests a reduction in hair compared to the typical form. The flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects."
