    "intro": "Selliguea lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf hepatic, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flat and green. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced on the underside of the thallus and aid in vegetative propagation. Selliguea lanceolata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
