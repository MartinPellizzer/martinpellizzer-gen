    "intro": "Selaginella xishuiensis, commonly known as the Xishui spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to China. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and distinctive strobilus structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
