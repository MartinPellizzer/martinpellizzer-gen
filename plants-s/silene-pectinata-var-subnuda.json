    "intro": "Silene pectinata var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked-stalked catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its lack of hairy structures on the stem and leaves."
