It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows, prairies, and along roadsides. Solidago corymbosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
