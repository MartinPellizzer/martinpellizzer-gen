    "intro": "Statice caput-alba, commonly known as white glassworts, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in saline or alkaline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Statice caput-alba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
