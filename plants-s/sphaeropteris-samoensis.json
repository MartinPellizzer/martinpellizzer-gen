    "intro": "Sphaeropteris samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Samoa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in the study of ancient plant evolution and biodiversity in island ecosystems."
