    "intro": "Sesleria calcarea var. hadacii, commonly known as the Hadac's rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
