    "intro": "Salvia bullulata, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and showy blue to purple flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes. Salvia bullulata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
