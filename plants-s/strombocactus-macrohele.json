    "intro": "Strombocactus macrohele, commonly known as the giant desert rose, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple coloration. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Strombocactus macrohele has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its growth is slow, making it a long-lived species with a unique ecological role in its native habitat."
