    "intro": "Silene serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silene serpentinicola is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and limited distribution."
