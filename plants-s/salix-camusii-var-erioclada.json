    "intro": "Salix camusii var. erioclada, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in mountainous regions."
