    "intro": "Schoenoxiphium lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically purple or lavender in color, arranged in a dense, rounded inflorescence. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Schoenoxiphium lehmannii is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
