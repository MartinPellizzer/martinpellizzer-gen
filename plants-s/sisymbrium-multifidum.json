    "intro": "Sisymbrium multifidum, commonly known as the narrowleaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it often grows in disturbed soils along roadsides or in fields. Sisymbrium multifidum is typically found in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
