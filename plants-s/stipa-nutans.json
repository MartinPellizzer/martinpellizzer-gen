It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a clumping growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Stipa nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and conservation efforts."
