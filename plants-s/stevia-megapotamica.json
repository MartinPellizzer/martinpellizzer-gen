    "intro": "Stevia megapotamica, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters, and it is often cultivated for its natural sweetening properties. Stevia megapotamica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
