    "intro": "Solanum pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family Solanaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are usually ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Solanum pittieri is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological roles in its native environment."
