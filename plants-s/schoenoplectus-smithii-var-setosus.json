It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine, hairy structures. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in wetlands, pond edges, and along streams. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
