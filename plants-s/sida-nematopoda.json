    "intro": "Sida nematopoda, commonly known as the smallleaf sida, is an annual herb native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
