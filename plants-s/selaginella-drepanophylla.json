    "intro": "Selaginella drepanophylla, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry. Selaginella drepanophylla plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
