It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes Mountains. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil in its natural habitat. The species is noted for its resilience to cold temperatures and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
