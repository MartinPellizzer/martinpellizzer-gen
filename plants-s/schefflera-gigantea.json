    "intro": "Schefflera gigantea, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive, umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera gigantea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
