    "intro": "Soldanella carpatica var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
