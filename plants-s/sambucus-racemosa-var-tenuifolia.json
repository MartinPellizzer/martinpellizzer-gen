    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a slender, pointed shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
