    "intro": "Solanum horridum var. horridum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple or black color. It has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which contribute to its prickly appearance. This species is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is considered somewhat invasive in some areas."
