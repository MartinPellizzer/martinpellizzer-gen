It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often branching stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense rosettes near the ground. Silene stellarioides is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas such as gravelly slopes and disturbed soils."
