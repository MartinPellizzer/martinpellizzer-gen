    "intro": "Sonneratia evenia, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and brackish water environments. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique adaptations to coastal and tidal areas. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Sonneratia evenia plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting biodiversity in mangrove ecosystems."
