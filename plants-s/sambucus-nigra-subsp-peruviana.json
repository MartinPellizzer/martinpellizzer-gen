    "intro": "Sambucus nigra subsp. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian elderberry, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
