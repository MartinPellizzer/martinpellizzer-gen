    "intro": "Spartium nubigenum, commonly known as cloud-spreading spartia, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
