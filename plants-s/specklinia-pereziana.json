    "intro": "Specklinia pereziana, commonly known as the Peruvian speckled fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a rare and fascinating subject in botanical studies."
