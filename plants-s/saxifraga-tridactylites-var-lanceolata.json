    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lance-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink, during the short growing season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
