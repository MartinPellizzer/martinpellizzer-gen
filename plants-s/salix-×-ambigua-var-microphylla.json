    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ambigua var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a hybrid species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found growing near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its foliage is a source of nectar for pollinators, and it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
