    "intro": "Solenostemon decumbens, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Solenostemon decumbens thrives in shallow water or damp ground, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
