    "intro": "Sideritis dendrochahorra var. soluta, commonly known as the Solitary Tree Sideritis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
