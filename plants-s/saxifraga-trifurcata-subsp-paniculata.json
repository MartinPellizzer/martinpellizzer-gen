    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rosette structure that helps protect it from harsh weather. The species is often found in alpine and tundra environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
