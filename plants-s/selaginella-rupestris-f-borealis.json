    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. borealis, commonly known as the northern clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures on rocky or sandy soils. This fern ally is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, temperate regions. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It is a rare and ancient species, reflecting the evolutionary history of vascular plants."
