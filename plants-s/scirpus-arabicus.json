It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy or saline soils. Scirpus arabicus is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in saline environments, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems."
