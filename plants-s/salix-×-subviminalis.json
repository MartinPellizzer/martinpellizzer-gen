    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 subviminalis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The bark of Salix \u00d7 subviminalis is thin and smooth, often displaying a pale or greyish hue, and it exudes a mild, aromatic scent when damaged."
