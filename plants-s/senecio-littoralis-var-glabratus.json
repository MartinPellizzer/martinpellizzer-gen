    "intro": "Senecio littoralis var. glabratus, commonly known as the coastal groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray, it is a common sight along the seashore."
