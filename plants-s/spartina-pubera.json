    "intro": "Spartina pubera, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Spartina pubera plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
