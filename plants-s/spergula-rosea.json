    "intro": "Spergula rosea, commonly known as rose bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Spergula rosea is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
