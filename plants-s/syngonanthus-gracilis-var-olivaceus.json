    "intro": "Syngonanthus gracilis var. olivaceus, commonly known as the olive-green spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are typically green to olive-hued, with small, clustered spikelets at the tips. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its pale green to olive-colored inflorescences, which contrast with the darker green foliage of the typical varietal form."
