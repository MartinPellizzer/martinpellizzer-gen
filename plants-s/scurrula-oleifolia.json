    "intro": "Scurrula oleifolia, commonly known as the oil plant or candle bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its bark is thick and flaky, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Scurrula oleifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
