    "intro": "Sphaeralcea pulchella, commonly known as the showy globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces spherical seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature that gives it its scientific name. Sphaeralcea pulchella thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and foothill habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
