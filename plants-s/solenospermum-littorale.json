    "intro": "Solenospermum littorale, commonly known as the coastal solenospermum, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Solenospermum littorale is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in littoral zones along the coast."
