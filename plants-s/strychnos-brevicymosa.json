It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that contain toxic compounds, including strychnine and brucine. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is generally avoided due to its potent and dangerous alkaloids."
