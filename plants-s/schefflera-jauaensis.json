    "intro": "Schefflera jauaensis, commonly known as the Jauaensis umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of compound leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, with a bushy, compact form. Its leaves are glossy, dark green, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Schefflera jauaensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
