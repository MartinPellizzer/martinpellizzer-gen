    "intro": "Statice rosea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Statice rosea is also valued in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and vibrant color."
