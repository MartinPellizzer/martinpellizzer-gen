    "intro": "Sedum subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments in North America. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a popular ornamental plant in landscaping."
