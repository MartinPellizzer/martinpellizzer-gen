    "intro": "Struthiopteris heterophylla, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnately compound or simple depending on the growth conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Struthiopteris heterophylla plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
