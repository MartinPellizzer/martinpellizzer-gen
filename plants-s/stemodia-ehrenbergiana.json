    "intro": "Stemodia ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant has fibrous roots and is well-suited to survive in harsh, dry environments."
