It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often brown or purplish in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a hardy species. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
