    "intro": "Scleria cenchroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with consistent moisture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
