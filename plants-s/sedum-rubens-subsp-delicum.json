It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
