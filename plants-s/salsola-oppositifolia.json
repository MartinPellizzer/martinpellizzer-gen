    "intro": "Salsola oppositifolia, commonly known as sandmat or Russian thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in desert environments. Salsola oppositifolia is often considered an invasive weed in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
