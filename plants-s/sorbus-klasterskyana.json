    "intro": "Sorbus klasterskyana, commonly known as the Klastersky's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Sorbus klasterskyana is adapted to harsh alpine environments, exhibiting resilience to cold and arid conditions."
