    "intro": "Styphelia longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. Styphelia longissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in its natural habitat."
