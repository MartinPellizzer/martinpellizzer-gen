    "intro": "Stenospermation ancuashii, commonly known as the Ancuashii orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in high-altitude environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
