It is characterized by its dark, often blackish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it is often found in moist or riparian habitats. It has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and conservation efforts."
