    "intro": "Stelis rictus, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure formed by the fusion of the sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a sweet, spicy fragrance. Stelis rictus prefers warm, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
