    "intro": "Symphyllia siletiana, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted for storing moisture. Symphyllia siletiana plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
