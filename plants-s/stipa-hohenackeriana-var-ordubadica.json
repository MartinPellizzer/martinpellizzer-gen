    "intro": "Stipa hohenackeriana var. ordubadica, commonly known as the Ordubad needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. This variety thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh mountainous terrain. The plant is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for endemic wildlife."
