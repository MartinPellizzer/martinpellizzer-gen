    "intro": "Stemonurus lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf stemonurus, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health."
