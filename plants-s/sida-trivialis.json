    "intro": "Sida trivialis, commonly known as seaside cotton or beach morning glory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, pale blue to white flowers and hairy, slender stems. The plant thrives in sandy, saline environments and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sida trivialis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various small insects and animals."
