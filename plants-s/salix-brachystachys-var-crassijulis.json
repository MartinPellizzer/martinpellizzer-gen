    "intro": "Salix brachystachys var. crassijulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species for stabilizing soil in riparian zones. Its adaptability and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
