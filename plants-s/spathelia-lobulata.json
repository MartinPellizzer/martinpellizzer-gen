    "intro": "Spathelia lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spathelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence. The plant produces pendulous, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Spathelia lobulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
