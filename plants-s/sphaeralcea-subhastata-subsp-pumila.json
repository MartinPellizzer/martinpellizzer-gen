    "intro": "Sphaeralcea subhastata subsp. pumila, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and along dry streambeds. Its small, rounded fruits are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals."
