    "intro": "Stelis endocharis, commonly known as the violet-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without being parasitic. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate beauty to its natural habitat."
