It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. It often grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Salsola longifolia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
