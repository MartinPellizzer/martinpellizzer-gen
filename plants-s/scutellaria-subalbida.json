    "intro": "Scutellaria subalbida, commonly known as the pale scutellaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, often arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for both its beauty and its role in supporting pollinators."
