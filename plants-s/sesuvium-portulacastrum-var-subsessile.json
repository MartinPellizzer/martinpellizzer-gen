    "intro": "Sesuvium portulacastrum var. subsessile, commonly known as coastal morning glory, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects."
