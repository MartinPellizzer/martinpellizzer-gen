    "intro": "Solanum holosericeum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, dense hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
