    "intro": "Stipa vulpiiformis, commonly known as fox-like grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered in dense tufts, giving it its distinctive appearance. Stipa vulpiiformis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
