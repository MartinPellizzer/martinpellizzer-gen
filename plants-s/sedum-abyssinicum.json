    "intro": "Sedum abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Ethiopia. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
