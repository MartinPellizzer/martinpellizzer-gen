    "intro": "Saussurea alpina subsp. eu-alpina, commonly known as the Alpine saffron, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
