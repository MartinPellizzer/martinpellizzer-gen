    "intro": "Smilax multiflora, commonly known as the common smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, spiny stems that help it climb or creep along the ground. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a rough texture and a waxy coating. Smilax multiflora is often found in moist woodlands and is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade."
