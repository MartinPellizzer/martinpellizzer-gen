It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in mountainous areas. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical gardens and ecological studies."
