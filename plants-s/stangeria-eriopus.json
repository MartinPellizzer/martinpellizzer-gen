    "intro": "Stangeria eriopus, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a unique member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows on rocky outcrops and in coastal areas. The plant has a rosette-forming structure with long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Stangeria eriopus is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established."
