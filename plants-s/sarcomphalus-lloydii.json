    "intro": "Sarcomphalus lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the deserts of Arizona and California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to store water efficiently. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Sarcomphalus lloydii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
