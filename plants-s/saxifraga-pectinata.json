    "intro": "Saxifraga pectinata, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. Saxifraga pectinata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its ability to survive in harsh climates makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
