    "intro": "Scilla pendula, commonly known as hanging scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that hang downward from slender stems, creating a striking visual effect. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Scilla pendula is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and early spring flowering."
