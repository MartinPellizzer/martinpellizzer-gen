    "intro": "Schmidtia ambigua, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Schmidtia ambigua has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds."
