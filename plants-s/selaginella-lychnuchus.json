    "intro": "Selaginella lychnuchus, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that forms dense mats, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a moss-like appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella lychnuchus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
