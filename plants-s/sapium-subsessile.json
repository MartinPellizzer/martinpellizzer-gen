    "intro": "Sapium subsessile, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Sapium subsessile is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and rapid growth rate. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
