It features lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
