    "intro": "Stellaria, commonly known as mouse-ear or starwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically small herbs with opposite, often hairy leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. They are found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Many species are annual or biennial, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds. Stellaria species are often used in herbal medicine and as ornamental plants in gardens."
