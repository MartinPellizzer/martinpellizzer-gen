    "intro": "Spiraea robusta, commonly known as the robust spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of showy, flat-topped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches heights of 3 to 6 feet and features dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall. Spiraea robusta thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
