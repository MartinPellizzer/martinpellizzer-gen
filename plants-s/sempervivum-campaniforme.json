    "intro": "Sempervivum campaniforme, commonly known as the \"Pineapple Plant,\" is a succulent perennial belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flower stalks that rise above the foliage, bearing small, star-shaped flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
