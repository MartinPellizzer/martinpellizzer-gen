    "intro": "Sorbus sudetica var. fatrae, commonly known as the Fatra rowan, is a rare subspecies of the rowan tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its small, orange-red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with acidic soils and is often found in mixed forests. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
