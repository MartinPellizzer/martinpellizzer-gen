    "intro": "Solanum membranifolium, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into clustered, lemon-yellow to red berries. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its berries are edible when ripe and have a tart, tangy flavor similar to that of a tomatillo. Solanum membranifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
