    "intro": "Senecio zongoensis, commonly known as the Zongo Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, temperate climates. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio zongoensis produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous habitat."
