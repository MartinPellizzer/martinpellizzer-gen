    "intro": "Scleroblitum, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and other shrubs. The plants are typically low-growing, with woody stems and small, clustered leaves adapted to conserve water. Scleroblitum species produce bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. These plants are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
