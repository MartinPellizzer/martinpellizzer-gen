    "intro": "Scrophularia pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus scrophularia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their medicinal and ornamental uses. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scrophularia pindicola is considered a vulnerable species."
