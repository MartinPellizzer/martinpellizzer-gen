    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon mackeeanum, commonly known as the Mackee's stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
