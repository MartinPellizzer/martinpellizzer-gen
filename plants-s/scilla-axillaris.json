    "intro": "Scilla axillaris, commonly known as the axillary scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically emerging from narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant's bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Scilla axillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and early blooming habit."
