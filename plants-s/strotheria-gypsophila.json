    "intro": "Strotheria gypsophila, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Strotheria gypsophila is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low, sprawling growth habit. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
