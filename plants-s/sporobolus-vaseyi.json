    "intro": "Sporobolus vaseyi, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain bristly, awned lemmas, which are characteristic of the grass family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its native dry environments. Sporobolus vaseyi plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
