    "intro": "Scleroschoenus, commonly known as the hard-leaved sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its tough, fibrous leaves and is typically found in wetland or marshy environments. The plants are perennial and often form dense, grass-like clumps. Scleroschoenus species are adapted to waterlogged soils and play a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Their flowers are small and clustered, often producing seeds that are dispersed by water or wind."
