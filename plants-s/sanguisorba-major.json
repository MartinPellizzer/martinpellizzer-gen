    "intro": "Sanguisorba major, commonly known as the greater dock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish down. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Sanguisorba major is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes."
