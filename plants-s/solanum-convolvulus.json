    "intro": "Solanum convolvulus, commonly known as goatweed or bindweed, is an annual or perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically red or purple in color. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a hairy texture, and it often grows in disturbed soils along roadsides or in fields. Solanum convolvulus is sometimes considered a weed but can also be used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
