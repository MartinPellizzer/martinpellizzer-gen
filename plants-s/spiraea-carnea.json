    "intro": "Spiraea carnea, commonly known as the rose willow or redleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of pink to red flowers in early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Spiraea carnea is often used in landscape design for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
