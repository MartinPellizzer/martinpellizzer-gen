    "intro": "Stachys spectabilis, commonly known as purple mint or great blue grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flower color and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
