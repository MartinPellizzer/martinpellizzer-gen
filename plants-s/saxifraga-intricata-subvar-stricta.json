    "intro": "Saxifraga intricata subvar. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. The plant features upright, branching stems with small, ovate leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to low-light conditions and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy, resilient species."
