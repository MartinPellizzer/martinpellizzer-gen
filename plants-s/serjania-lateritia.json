    "intro": "Serjania lateritia, commonly known as the Brazilian serjania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Serjaneae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, Serjania lateritia is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
