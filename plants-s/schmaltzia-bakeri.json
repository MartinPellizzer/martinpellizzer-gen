    "intro": "Schmaltzia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's schmaltzia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Schmaltzia bakeri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
