    "intro": "Stapelia retusa, commonly known as the bird's nest plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often reddish or orange-colored stems that resemble a bird's nest. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Stapelia retusa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening."
