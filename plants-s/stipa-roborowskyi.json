    "intro": "Stipa roborowskyi, commonly known as the Roborowsky's feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of silky, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
