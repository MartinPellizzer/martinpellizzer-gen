The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Sida physaloides is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is also considered a weed in many regions due to its invasive potential and competitive nature."
