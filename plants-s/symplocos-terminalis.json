    "intro": "Symplocos terminalis, commonly known as the red-fruited inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, and its distinctive red, fleshy berries that persist through winter. The plant is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Symplocos terminalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions. Its berries provide food for birds and small mammals, contributing to local ecosystems."
