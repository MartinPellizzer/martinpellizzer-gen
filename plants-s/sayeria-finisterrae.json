    "intro": "Sayeria finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, coastal environments. Sayeria finisterrae is known for its small, narrow leaves and is often found in association with other endemic flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
