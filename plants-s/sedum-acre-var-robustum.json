    "intro": "Sedum acre var. robustum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a hardy succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically green or reddish, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sedum acre var. robustum is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, requiring minimal care once established."
