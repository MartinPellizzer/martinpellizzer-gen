    "intro": "Solanum mamilliferum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in small, raised bumps called mamillae. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries containing toxic alkaloids. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
