    "intro": "Saussurea ovatifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. Saussurea ovatifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supporting local biodiversity."
