It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, simple leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
