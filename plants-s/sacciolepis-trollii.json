    "intro": "Sacciolepis trollii, commonly known as the dwarf sacciolepis, is a flowering plant native to the island of Saba in the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sacciolepis trollii is considered a rare and endemic species."
