    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which bear small, fluffy flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid environments."
