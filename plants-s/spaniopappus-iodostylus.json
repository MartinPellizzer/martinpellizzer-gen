    "intro": "Spaniopappus iodostylus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with silky hairs, aiding in its propagation across arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Spaniopappus iodostylus is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
