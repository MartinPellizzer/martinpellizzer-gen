    "intro": "Sarcomphalus obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or spatulate in shape, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Sarcomphalus obtusifolius is often found in coastal dunes, gravel plains, and other harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
