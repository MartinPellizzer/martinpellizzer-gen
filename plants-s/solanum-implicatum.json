    "intro": "Solanum implicatum, commonly known as the curlleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are characterized by their curled margins, which give the plant its common name. Solanum implicatum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
