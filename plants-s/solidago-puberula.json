    "intro": "Solidago puberula, commonly known as the downy goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, downy hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Solidago puberula plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the fall season."
