    "intro": "Scaphyglottis punctulata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a short rhizome and produces tubular, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as bees and flies, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Scaphyglottis punctulata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
