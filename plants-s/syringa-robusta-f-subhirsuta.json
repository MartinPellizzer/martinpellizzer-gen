    "intro": "Syringa robusta f. subhirsuta, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a compact shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, giving the plant its 'subhirsuta' designation, which refers to the soft, downy texture. It is native to eastern Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is more cold-hardy than the species and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun."
