    "intro": "Stelis endresii, commonly known as the Endres' spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis endresii is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
