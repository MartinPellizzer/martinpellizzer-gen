It is characterized by its unique, hood-like bracts that enclose the inflorescence, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and often white or pale green, with a distinctive, spurred lip. Schismatoglottis ecaudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unusual appearance."
