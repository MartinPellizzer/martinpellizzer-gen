It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking purple color when mature. Its small, fragrant white flowers are followed by edible, dark purple berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Syzygium myrtilloides thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
