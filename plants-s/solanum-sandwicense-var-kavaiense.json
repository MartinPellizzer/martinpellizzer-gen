    "intro": "Solanum sandwicense var. kavaiense, commonly known as the Kauai nightshade, is a rare plant endemic to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a shrub characterized by its small, ovate leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is adapted to the unique climate of its native environment. Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
