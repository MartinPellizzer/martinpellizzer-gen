The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery underside, giving the plant a striking visual effect. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
