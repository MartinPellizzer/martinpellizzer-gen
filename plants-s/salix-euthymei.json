    "intro": "Salix euthymei, commonly known as the Euthymic willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many willow species. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Salix euthymei is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
