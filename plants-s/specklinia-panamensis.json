    "intro": "Specklinia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its roots to anchor itself without deriving nutrients from its host. Its foliage is often covered in a layer of moss-like growth, which helps retain moisture. Specklinia panamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
