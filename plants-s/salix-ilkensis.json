    "intro": "Salix ilkensis, commonly known as the Turkish willow, is a shrub or small tree native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its flexible, slender branches. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Salix ilkensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
