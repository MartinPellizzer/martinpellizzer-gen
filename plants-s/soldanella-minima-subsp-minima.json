    "intro": "Soldanella minima subsp. minima, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small, alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, clustered at the base, and are usually narrow and hairy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
