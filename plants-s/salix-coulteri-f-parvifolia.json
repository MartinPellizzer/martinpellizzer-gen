    "intro": "Salix coulteri f. parvifolia, commonly known as Coulter's weeping willow, is a unique cultivar of the willow tree characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and cascading branches. It is a deciduous plant native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. The leaves are smaller and more finely textured compared to typical willow species, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its graceful form. This cultivar is valued for its adaptability and aesthetic appeal in garden settings."
