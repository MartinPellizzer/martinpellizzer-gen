    "intro": "Sclerocephalus arabicus f. leianthus, commonly known as the Arabian hardhead, is a rare and unique plant native to arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tough, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss and helps it endure extreme temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
