    "intro": "Selinum salinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and striking spiky yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Selinum salinum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
