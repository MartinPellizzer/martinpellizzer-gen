    "intro": "Schisandra sphenanthera var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stalked five-flowered schisandra, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-brown bark and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red berries that are rich in bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine and pharmacology. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
