    "intro": "Sckuhria dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Sckuhria dichotoma is adapted to harsh, cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
