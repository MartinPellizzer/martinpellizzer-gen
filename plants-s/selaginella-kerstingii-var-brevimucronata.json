    "intro": "Selaginella kerstingii var. brevimucronata, commonly known as the Kersting's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves and small, spore-bearing structures called strobila. This variant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and evolutionary significance make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
