    "intro": "Sagina reuteri, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Sagina reuteri is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
