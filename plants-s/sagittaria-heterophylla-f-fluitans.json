    "intro": "Sagittaria heterophylla f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It exhibits a unique adaptation to aquatic environments, with its leaves floating on the water surface while its roots are submerged. The plant has long, narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often green or reddish in color. It produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, typically in late spring to early summer. This species is often found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for aquatic life."
