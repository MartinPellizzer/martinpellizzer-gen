    "intro": "Spiraea \u00d7 nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-stem spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that are often leafless during the winter months. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically bright green in summer and turns yellow or red in the fall. Spiraea \u00d7 nudiflora is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
