    "intro": "Spinulum zonatum, commonly known as the zoned spinulum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, multicolored foliage that displays a unique zonation pattern, with alternating bands of green, yellow, and red. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are broad and slightly waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
