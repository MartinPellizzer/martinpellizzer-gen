    "intro": "Sabouraea, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Sabouraea species are typically drought-tolerant and have adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Their leaves are often small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration."
