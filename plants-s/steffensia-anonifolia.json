    "intro": "Steffensia anonifolia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Steffensia anonifolia is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
