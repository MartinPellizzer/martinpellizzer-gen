    "intro": "Salvia azuensis, commonly known as Mexican blue sage, is a member of the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. It is native to Mexico and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional herbal medicine. Salvia azuensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and hardy nature."
