    "intro": "Spiraea pilosa subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. The subspecies pilosa is distinguished by its more robust growth and increased hairiness compared to other subspecies of Spiraea pilosa."
