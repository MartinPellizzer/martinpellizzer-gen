    "intro": "Salix koeieana, commonly known as the Koeie's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its main reproductive structures, and it flowers in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix koeieana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and streams. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
