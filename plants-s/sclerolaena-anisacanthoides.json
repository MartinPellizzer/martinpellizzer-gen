    "intro": "Sclerolaena anisacanthoides, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are dispersed by animals. Sclerolaena anisacanthoides is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils."
