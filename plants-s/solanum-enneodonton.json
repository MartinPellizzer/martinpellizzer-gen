    "intro": "Solanum enneodonton, commonly known as the purple leaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking purple leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are a key feature in its ecological role. Solanum enneodonton is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields."
