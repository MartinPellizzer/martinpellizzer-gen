    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. asiatica, commonly known as the Asiatic rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
