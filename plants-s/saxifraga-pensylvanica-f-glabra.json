    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a cyme. It thrives in rocky, moist habitats and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its environment, with a compact growth form that helps it survive in shaded, nutrient-poor soils."
