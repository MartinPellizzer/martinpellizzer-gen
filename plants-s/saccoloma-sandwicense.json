    "intro": "Saccoloma sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or on rocky surfaces. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
