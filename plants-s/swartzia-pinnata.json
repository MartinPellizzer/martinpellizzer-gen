    "intro": "Swartzia pinnata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a glossy appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. Swartzia pinnata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument and furniture industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
