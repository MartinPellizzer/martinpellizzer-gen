It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin, and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
