    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. negrum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its dark purple to black berries. It is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa and is known for its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces toxic berries that contain solanine and other alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a notable ornamental plant and a species of caution due to its toxic properties."
