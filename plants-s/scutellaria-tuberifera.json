    "intro": "Scutellaria tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous scutellaria, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. Scutellaria tuberifera is known for its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and pharmacological study."
