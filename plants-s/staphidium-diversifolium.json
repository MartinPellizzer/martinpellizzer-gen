    "intro": "Staphidium diversifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved staphidium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that split open to release seeds. Staphidium diversifolium is native to certain regions of South America and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
