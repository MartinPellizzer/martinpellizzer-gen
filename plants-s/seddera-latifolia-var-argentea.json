It is characterized by its broad, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage provides a striking contrast to its green stems and flowers, which are typically small and clustered.
