    "intro": "Stapelia courcellii, commonly known as the \"Coral Stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are often orange or red in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia courcellii is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
