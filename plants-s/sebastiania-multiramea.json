    "intro": "Sebastiania multiramea, commonly known as the waxleaf sebastiania, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is suitable for container gardening and small garden spaces."
