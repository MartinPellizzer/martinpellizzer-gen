It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
