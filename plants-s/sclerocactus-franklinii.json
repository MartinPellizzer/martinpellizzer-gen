    "intro": "Sclerocactus franklinii, commonly known as Franklin's brittlestem, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
