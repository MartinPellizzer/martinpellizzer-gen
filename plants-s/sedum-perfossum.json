    "intro": "Sedum perfossum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
