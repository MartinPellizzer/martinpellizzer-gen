    "intro": "Sideroxylon cinereum var. puberulum, commonly known as the rough-surfaced ironwood tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and yellowish, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. This species is valued for its durable timber and is often found in disturbed or secondary forest habitats."
