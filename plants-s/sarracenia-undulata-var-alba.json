    "intro": "Sarracenia undulata var. alba, commonly known as the white whorled pitcher plant, is a variant of the whorled pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, undulating, tubular leaves that form deep, narrow pitchers. The varietal form alba is notable for its pale to white coloration, which contrasts with the typical green of the species. The pitchers are adapted to trap and digest insects, providing the plant with essential nutrients. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
