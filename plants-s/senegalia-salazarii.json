    "intro": "Senegalia salazarii, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers and has small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock. Senegalia salazarii is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in traditional medicine."
