    "intro": "Senecio llewelynii, commonly known as the Llewelyn's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are yellow and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
