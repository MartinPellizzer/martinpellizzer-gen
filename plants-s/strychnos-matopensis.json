    "intro": "Strychnos matopensis, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is highly poisonous due to the presence of strychnine and brucine. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
