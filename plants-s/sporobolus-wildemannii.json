    "intro": "Sporobolus wildemannii, commonly known as wildermann's sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with fine, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds, a feature that aids in its spread across arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its botanical structure reflects its ecological role as a stabilizing plant in desert ecosystems."
