    "intro": "Selaginella chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean spike moss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky soils or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged spirally around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are located at the tips of the stems. Selaginella chilensis is well adapted to temperate climates and is often found in South American regions such as Chile and Argentina."
