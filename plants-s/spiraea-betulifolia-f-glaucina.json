    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia f. glaucina, commonly known as the glaucous willow-leaf spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early to mid-spring, which are borne on elongated, raceme-like inflorescences. Its foliage is typically a vibrant green in summer, turning yellow in autumn, and it has a generally upright growth habit. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. It is also resistant to many common pests and diseases, making it a low-maintenance choice for landscaping."
