    "intro": "Sinocarum filicinum, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of true ferns, though it belongs to the family Salviniaceae. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Sinocarum filicinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in water gardens."
