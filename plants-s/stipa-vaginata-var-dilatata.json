    "intro": "Stipa vaginata var. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved feathergrass, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, coastal areas, and disturbed sites. Its delicate appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in its native range."
