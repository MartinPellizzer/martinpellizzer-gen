    "intro": "Schanginia borszczowii, commonly known as the Borszczowii saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Schanginia borszczowii is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in high-altitude environments."
