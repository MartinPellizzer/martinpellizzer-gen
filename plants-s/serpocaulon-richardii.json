    "intro": "Serpocaulon richardii, commonly known as the Richard's serpocaulon, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by bright red berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Serpocaulon richardii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
