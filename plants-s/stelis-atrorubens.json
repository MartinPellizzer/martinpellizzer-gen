    "intro": "Stelis atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a reddish tint. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive red lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. Stelis atrorubens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth."
