It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Sporobolus aristatus is an important forage plant for livestock and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
