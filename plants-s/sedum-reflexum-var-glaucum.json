It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
