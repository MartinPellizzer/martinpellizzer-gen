    "intro": "Soroseris deasyi, commonly known as the Deasy's soroseris, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a compact cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Soroseris deasyi is considered a rare and endangered species."
