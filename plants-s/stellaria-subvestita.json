    "intro": "Stellaria subvestita, commonly known as the velvet starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, slender stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and unique floral structure make it a notable species in botanical studies and garden cultivation."
