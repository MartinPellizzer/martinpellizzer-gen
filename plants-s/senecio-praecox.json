It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture.
