    "intro": "Solanum sagranum, commonly known as the Trinidadian nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it bears berries that change color from green to yellow or red as they mature. Solanum sagranum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species for ecological studies in its native region."
