    "intro": "Stipa pennata f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that are highly ornamental and often used in landscaping. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry garden settings. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
