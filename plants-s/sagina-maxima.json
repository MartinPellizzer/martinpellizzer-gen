    "intro": "Sagina maxima, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features a dense mat of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Sagina maxima thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and rocky areas."
