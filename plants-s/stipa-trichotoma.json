    "intro": "Stipa trichotoma, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted clusters of fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
