    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio johnstonii is also known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
