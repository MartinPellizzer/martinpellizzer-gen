It features dense, woolly gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive addition to xeriscapic landscapes."
