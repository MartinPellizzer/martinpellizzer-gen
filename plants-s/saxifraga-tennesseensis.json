    "intro": "Saxifraga tennesseensis, commonly known as Tennessee saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptic to ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from excessive moisture loss."
