It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in spikelets, and it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration."
