    "intro": "Scirpus supinus var. melanospermus, commonly known as the black-seeded bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush genus Scirpus. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with reddish or purple hues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that bloom in late summer. The distinctive black seeds of this variety are an important characteristic for identification and ecological roles in wetland ecosystems."
