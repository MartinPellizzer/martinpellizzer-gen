    "intro": "Salvia foetida, commonly known as stinking sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in arid or rocky environments. Its strong, pungent fragrance is a distinctive botanical feature, giving it its common name."
