    "intro": "Symplocos cyclops, commonly known as the slender waxleaf. It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Symplocos cyclops is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
