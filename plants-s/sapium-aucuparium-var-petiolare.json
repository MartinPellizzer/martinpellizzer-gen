    "intro": "Sapium aucuparium var. petiolare, commonly known as the petiolate Chinese lantern, is a variant of the Chinese lantern plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, inflated, orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a heart-shaped base with a long petiole, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant, showy inflorescences."
