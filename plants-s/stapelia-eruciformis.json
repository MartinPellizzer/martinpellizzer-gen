    "intro": "Stapelia eruciformis, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that resemble dead animals, a feature evolved to attract pollinating flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it has a slow growth rate. Stapelia eruciformis is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
