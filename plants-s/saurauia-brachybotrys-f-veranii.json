    "intro": "Saurauia brachybotrys f. veranii, commonly known as the summer saurauia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, red berries. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in cool, humid climates."
