It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that are typically arrowhead-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by round, berry-like fruits that are red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
