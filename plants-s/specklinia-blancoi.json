    "intro": "Specklinia blancoi, commonly known as the Blanco's orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features linear to lance-shaped leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, violet or white blossoms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
