    "intro": "Salix cyanolimenaea, commonly known as the blue-limbed willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive bluish-green hue, which gives it its common name. Salix cyanolimenaea is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in alpine meadows."
