    "intro": "Stigmatopteris contracta, commonly known as the contracted shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often folded or contracted, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The botanical features of Stigmatopteris contracta make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and botany."
