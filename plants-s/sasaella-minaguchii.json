It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by edible, rice-like seeds. Sasaella minaguchii is often used in traditional Japanese landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form thick, low-growing mats."
