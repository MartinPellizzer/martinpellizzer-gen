    "intro": "Styrax nervosus, commonly known as the fragrant styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark red berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Styrax nervosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and floral display."
