    "intro": "Schoenus juvenis var. robustus, commonly known as the robust flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers during the growing season. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife. Its botanical structure is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and the presence of three-nerved leaves."
