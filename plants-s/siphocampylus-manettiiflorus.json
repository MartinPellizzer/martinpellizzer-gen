    "intro": "Siphocampylus manettiiflorus, commonly known as the Manetti's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features slender, erect stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Siphocampylus manettiiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
