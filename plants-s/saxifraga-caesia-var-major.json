    "intro": "Saxifraga caesia var. major, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant."
