    "intro": "Sideroxylon pallidum, commonly known as the pale ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically has elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
