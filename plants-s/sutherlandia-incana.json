    "intro": "Sutherlandia incana, commonly known as the African smoke bush, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-gray color due to the dense covering of trichomes. Sutherlandia incana is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
