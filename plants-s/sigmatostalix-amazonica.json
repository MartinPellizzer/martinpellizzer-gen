    "intro": "Sigmatostalix amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian star-leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
