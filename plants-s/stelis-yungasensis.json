    "intro": "Stelis yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid highland forests of the Yungas region in Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or among vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
