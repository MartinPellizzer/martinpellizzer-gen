    "intro": "Solanum verbascifolium var. exstipulatum, commonly known as the exstipulate woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces smooth, spherical berries that transition from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care."
