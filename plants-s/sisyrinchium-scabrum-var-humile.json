    "intro": "Sisyrinchium scabrum var. humile, commonly known as the plains blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and is often found in prairie habitats or open woodlands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The variety humile is distinguished by its smaller stature and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of S. scabrum."
