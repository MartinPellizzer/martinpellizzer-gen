    "intro": "Sophora flavescens var. galegoides, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of bioactive compounds like cycloalkanoids."
