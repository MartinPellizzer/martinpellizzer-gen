    "intro": "Strebanthus heterophylus, commonly known as the variable strebanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others compound, depending on the environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its adaptability to different light conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
