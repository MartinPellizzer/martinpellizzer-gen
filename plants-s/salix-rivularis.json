    "intro": "Salix rivularis, commonly known as the river willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows near water bodies such as rivers, streams, and wetlands, adapting to moist and often sandy soils. The plant has slender, flexible branches and small, triangular leaves that are usually gray-green in color. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Salix rivularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
