    "intro": "Saxifraga vochinensis, commonly known as the Vochna saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
