It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes, prairies, and disturbed areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Sabatia nana is an important component of coastal and inland ecosystems, providing nectar for various pollinators."
