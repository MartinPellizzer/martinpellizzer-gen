It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in shallow water or damp soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense stands, making it an important species in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
