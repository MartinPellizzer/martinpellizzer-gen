    "intro": "Stichorkis cespitosa, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, bristly seed heads, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Stichorkis cespitosa is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
