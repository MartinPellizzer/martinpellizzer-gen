    "intro": "Stelechantha cauliflora, commonly known as the caladium tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, and white. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, emerging from the base of the stems rather than the top, a feature known as cauliflorous growth. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Stelechantha cauliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and tropical landscapes."
