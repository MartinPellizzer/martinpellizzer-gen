    "intro": "Satyrium carsonii, commonly known as Carson's twayblade, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
