    "intro": "Salix repens var. lanuginosa, commonly known as silky willow or woolly catkin willow, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female flowers on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along streambanks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
