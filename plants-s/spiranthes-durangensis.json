    "intro": "Spiranthes durangensis, commonly known as the Durango ladies' tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine-oak forests. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
