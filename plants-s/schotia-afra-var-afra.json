    "intro": "Schotia afra var. afra, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white, powdery coating on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often clustered at the ends of the branches. It produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
