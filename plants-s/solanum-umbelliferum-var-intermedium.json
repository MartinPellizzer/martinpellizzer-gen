    "intro": "Solanum umbelliferum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces purple-black berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
