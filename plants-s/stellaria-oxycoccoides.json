    "intro": "Stellaria oxycoccoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Stellaria oxycoccoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
