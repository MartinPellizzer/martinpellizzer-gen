    "intro": "Senecio linariifolius var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing rosette of gray-green, narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
