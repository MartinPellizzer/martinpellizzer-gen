    "intro": "Streptocarpus biflorus, commonly known as the double-flowered streptocarpus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces two flowers per stem, giving it its common name, and has fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Streptocarpus biflorus is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value."
