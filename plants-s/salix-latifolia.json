    "intro": "Salix latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a hardy plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix latifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil along waterways."
