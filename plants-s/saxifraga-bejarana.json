    "intro": "Saxifraga bejarana, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
