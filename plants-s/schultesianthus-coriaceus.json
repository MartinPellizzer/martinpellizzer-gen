It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, providing a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is rough and fissured, contributing to its common name. Schultesianthus coriaceus is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
