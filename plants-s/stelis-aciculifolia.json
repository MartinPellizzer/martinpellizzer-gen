    "intro": "Stelis aciculifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaf stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in raceme-like inflorescences, and are often pale green or white in color. Stelis aciculifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
