    "intro": "Sporobolus virginicus, commonly known as coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate salt spray makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
