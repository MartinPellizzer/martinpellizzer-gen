    "intro": "Streptocarpus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated streptocarpus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its unique inflated seed pods, which resemble small balloons, give it its common name and aid in seed dispersal. Streptocarpus inflatus is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
