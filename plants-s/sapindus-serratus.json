    "intro": "Sapindus serratus, commonly known as the rough soapnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange, fuzzy fruits that contain several seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the ability to produce a natural soap-like substance from its seeds, which has been traditionally used for cleaning purposes. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils."
