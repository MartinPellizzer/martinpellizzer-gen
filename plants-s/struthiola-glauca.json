    "intro": "Struthiola glauca, commonly known as the blue struthiola, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique coloration and compact growth habit make it a striking addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Struthiola glauca is adapted to arid and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
