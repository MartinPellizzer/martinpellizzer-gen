    "intro": "Scleria ciliaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Scleria ciliaris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
