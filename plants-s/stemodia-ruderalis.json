    "intro": "Stemodia ruderalis, commonly known as the roughstemmed sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its stiff, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
