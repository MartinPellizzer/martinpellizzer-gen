    "intro": "Sarcochilus ceciliae var. eriochilus, commonly known as the Cecilia\u2019s Sarcochilus, is a rare and striking orchid native to New Zealand. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
