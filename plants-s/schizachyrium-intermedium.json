    "intro": "Schizachyrium intermedium, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. The plant produces dense, tufted clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that turn golden in the fall. It is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife. Little bluestem is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
