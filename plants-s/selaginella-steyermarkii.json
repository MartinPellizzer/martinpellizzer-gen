    "intro": "Selaginella steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are often needle-like in appearance. Its sporophyte stage is characterized by the presence of microsporangia and megasporangia, which are responsible for producing spores. Selaginella steyermarkii is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
