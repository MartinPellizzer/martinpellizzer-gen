    "intro": "Salix cordata var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid willow, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its flexible branches make it suitable for use in landscaping and erosion control."
