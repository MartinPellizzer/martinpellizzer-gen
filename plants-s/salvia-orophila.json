    "intro": "Salvia orophila, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Salvia orophila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry climates."
