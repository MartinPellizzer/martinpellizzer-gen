    "intro": "Symplocos olivacea, commonly known as oliveleaf inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Symplocos olivacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
