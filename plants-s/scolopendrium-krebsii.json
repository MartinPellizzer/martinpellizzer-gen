    "intro": "Scolopendrium krebsii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an attractive and relatively easy-to-care-for ornamental plant."
