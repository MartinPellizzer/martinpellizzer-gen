    "intro": "Scalesia decurrens, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos tree, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its large, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence, which attracts various pollinators. Scalesia decurrens is notable for its unique ecological role in the high-altitude ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
