    "intro": "Seseli oligophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It has finely divided, feathery leaves that are often mistaken for those of other umbelliferous species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
