    "intro": "Stelis nephropetala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis nephropetala thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
