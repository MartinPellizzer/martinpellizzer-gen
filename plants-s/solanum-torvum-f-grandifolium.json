    "intro": "Solanum torvum f. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved nightshade, is a variant of the common morning glory. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a plant of caution due to its toxicity."
