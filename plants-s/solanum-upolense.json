It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal properties."
