    "intro": "Stemonurus polymorphus var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved stemonurus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
