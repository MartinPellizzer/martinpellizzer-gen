    "intro": "Solanum medians var. angustifoliolum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a deep blue or black. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
