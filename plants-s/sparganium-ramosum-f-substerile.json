    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum f. substerile, commonly known as the sterile fragrant burr, is a botanical variant of the common burr plant. It is characterized by its reduced fertility, resulting in the absence of viable seeds. The plant retains the typical morphology of Sparganium ramosum, featuring dense, spiky inflorescences and aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habits. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its sterile nature makes it useful for ornamental purposes or in controlled ecological studies."
