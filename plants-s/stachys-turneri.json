    "intro": "Stachys turneri, commonly known as desert vervain, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Stachys turneri is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soil conditions make it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
