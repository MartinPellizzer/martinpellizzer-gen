    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia f. albida, commonly known as the white arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its pale, almost white foliage. It is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. It produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding a delicate aesthetic to its habitat. This cultivar is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to improve water quality."
