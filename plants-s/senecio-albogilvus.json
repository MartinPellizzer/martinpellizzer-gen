It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine white or grayish powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
