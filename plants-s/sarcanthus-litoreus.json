    "intro": "Sarcanthus litoreus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty air and wind. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils along shorelines. Sarcanthus litoreus is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
