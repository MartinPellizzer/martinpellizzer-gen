    "intro": "Sorghum nutans subsp. albescens, commonly known as whitehead sorghum, is a lesser-known subspecies of the sorghum genus native to Africa. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other sorghum varieties. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is adapted to semi-arid conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soil. While not widely cultivated for grain, it holds ecological significance in its native regions."
