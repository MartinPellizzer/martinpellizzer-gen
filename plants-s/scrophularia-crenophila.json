    "intro": "Scrophularia crenophila, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a wavy or scalloped edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Scrophularia crenophila is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes."
