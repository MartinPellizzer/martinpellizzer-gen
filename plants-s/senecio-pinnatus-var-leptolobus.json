    "intro": "Senecio pinnatus var. leptolobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
