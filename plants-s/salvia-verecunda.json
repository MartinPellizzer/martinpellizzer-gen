    "intro": "Salvia verecunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Salvia verecunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
