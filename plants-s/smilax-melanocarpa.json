    "intro": "Smilax melanocarpa, commonly known as the blackberry vine, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dark purple to black berries. These berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in jams and wines. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
