    "intro": "Schistocarpha platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, often with a slightly hairy surface. This perennial plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and dry grasslands. It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
