    "intro": "Stigmatosema furcula, commonly known as the hairy antler fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, antler-like fronds that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered in a way that resembles a furrow, which is a defining feature of the genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
