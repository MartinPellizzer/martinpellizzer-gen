It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.

Synthyris canbyi is a relatively rare species, and its conservation status is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
