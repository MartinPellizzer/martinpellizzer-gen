    "intro": "Selaginella exilis, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its delicate, grass-like stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella exilis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
