    "intro": "Salvia praeterita, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Salvia praeterita is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
