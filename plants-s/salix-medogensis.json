    "intro": "Salix medogensis, commonly known as the Yarkand willow, is a species of willow native to the Xinjiang region of China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are catkin-like, typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal. Salix medogensis is adapted to withstand drought and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
