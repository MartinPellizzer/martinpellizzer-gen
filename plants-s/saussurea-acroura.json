It features a robust, woody root system and a tall, branched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow to orange flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite structure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with dense, white hairs, adapted to the cold, arid environments it inhabits.
