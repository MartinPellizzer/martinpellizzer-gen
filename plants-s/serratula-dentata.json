    "intro": "Serratula dentata, commonly known as the toothed sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Serratula dentata is an annual herb that can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
