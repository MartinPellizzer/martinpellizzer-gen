It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Solidago microphylla plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
