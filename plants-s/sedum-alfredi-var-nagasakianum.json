It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
