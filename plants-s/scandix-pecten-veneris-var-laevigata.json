    "intro": "Scandix pecten-veneris var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that resemble a cluster of small petals. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in open habitats with well-drained soil. The variety laevigata is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to other varieties of the species."
