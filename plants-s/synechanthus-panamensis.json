    "intro": "Synechanthus panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster. Synechanthus panamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
