    "intro": "Saccharum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered cane grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often found near water bodies. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface. While not as economically important as other sugarcane species, it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
