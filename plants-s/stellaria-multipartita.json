    "intro": "Stellaria multipartita, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, spoon-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense mats in favorable conditions. Stellaria multipartita is also used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
