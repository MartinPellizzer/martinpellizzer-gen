    "intro": "Syzygium glomeruliferum, commonly known as the clustered apple or glomeruliferum apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit, a small, round, yellowish drupe, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Syzygium glomeruliferum is often found in rainforest and coastal habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
