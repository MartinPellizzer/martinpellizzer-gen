    "intro": "Scepocarpus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid scepocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
