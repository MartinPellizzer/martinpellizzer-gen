    "intro": "Stechmannia hyrcana, commonly known as the Hyrcanian stechmannia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Caspian region of Iran. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and riverbanks. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Stechmannia hyrcana is considered a vulnerable species."
