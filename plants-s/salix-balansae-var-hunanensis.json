It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
