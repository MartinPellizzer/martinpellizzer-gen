    "intro": "Scurrula chingii var. chingii, commonly known as the Chinese scurrula, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
