It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with yellowish-white margins. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in arid environments. Sansevieria aethiopica is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, as it can remove toxins from indoor air."
