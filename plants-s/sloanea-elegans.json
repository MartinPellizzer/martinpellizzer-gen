    "intro": "Sloanea elegans, commonly known as the velvetleaf sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Sloanea elegans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
