    "intro": "Salacia viminea, commonly known as the climbing salacia, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that climb using tendrils, and its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Salacia viminea is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
