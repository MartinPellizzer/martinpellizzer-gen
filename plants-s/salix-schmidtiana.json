    "intro": "Salix schmidtiana, commonly known as the Schmidt's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and finely toothed, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
