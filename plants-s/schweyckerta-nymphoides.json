    "intro": "Schweyckerta nymphoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble the shape of a nymph, hence its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
