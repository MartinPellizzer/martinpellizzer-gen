    "intro": "Schima sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and alternate, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that contain one to three seeds. Schima sinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
