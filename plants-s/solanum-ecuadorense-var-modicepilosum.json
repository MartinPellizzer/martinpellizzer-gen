    "intro": "Solanum ecuadorense var. modicepilosum, commonly known as the Ecuadorian nightshade, is a species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are typically berries that mature to a dark blue or black color, containing several seeds. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
