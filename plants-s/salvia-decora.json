It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from purple to blue, often with a white or pink throat. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia decora is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
