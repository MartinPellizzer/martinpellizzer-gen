    "intro": "Sterculia alexandri, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
