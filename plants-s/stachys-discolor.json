    "intro": "Stachys discolor, commonly known as the silverweed or white dead-nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges or meadows. Stachys discolor is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
