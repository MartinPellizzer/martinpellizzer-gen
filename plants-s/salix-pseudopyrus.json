    "intro": "Salix pseudopyrus, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery underside, giving them a distinctive appearance. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along waterways."
