    "intro": "Spiranthes rupestris var. parviflora, commonly known as the rock twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its specialized root system. This variant is distinguished from other Spiranthes species by its smaller, more delicate flowers and specific habitat preferences."
