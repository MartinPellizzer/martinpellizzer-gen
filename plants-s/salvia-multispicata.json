    "intro": "Salvia multispicata, commonly known as purple giant sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense spikes of showy violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage has a strong, mint-like scent, and it is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Salvia multispicata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for perennial gardens."
