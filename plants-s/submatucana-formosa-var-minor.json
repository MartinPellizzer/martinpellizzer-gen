    "intro": "Submatucana formosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser beauty bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a contrasting purple or violet throat. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
