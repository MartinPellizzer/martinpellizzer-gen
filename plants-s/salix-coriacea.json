    "intro": "Salix coriacea, commonly known as the rough-barked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark that becomes rough and scaly with age. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in basket-making."
