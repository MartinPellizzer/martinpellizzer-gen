    "intro": "Selaginella weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant is typically evergreen and can thrive in moist, shaded environments. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature common in many mosses and ferns. Selaginella weberbaueri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
