    "intro": "Serapias istriaca, commonly known as the Istrian marsh orchid, is a rare and protected species native to the Adriatic region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
