    "intro": "Sinobaijiania taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities. Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical research."
