    "intro": "Scaligeria allioides, commonly known as the garlic lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a bulb-like structure that stores nutrients, similar to true bulbs, though it is not a true bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and evergreen foliage."
