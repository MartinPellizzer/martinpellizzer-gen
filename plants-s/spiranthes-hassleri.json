    "intro": "Spiranthes hassleri, commonly known as the Hassler's spiral orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as bogs, wet meadows, and pine woods. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some regions."
