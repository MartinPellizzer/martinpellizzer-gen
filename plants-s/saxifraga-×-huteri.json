    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 huteri, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically oval to spoon-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Saxifraga \u00d7 huteri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, decorative ground covers."
