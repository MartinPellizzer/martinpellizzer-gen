    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. laevis, commonly known as lettuceleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves that are often mistaken for lettuce, hence its common name. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
