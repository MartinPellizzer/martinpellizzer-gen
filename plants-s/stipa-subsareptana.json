    "intro": "Stipa subsareptana, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its dry climate. Stipa subsareptana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
