    "intro": "Stachys reticulata, commonly known as the silverweed or purple deadnettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers with purple or pink petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Stachys reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
