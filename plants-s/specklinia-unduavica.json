    "intro": "Specklinia unduavica, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its natural range."
