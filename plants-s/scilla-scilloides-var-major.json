    "intro": "Scilla scilloides var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are relatively small and are often used in rock gardens or as ornamental plants. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
