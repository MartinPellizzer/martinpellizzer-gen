    "intro": "Salix angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Salix angustior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian habitats."
