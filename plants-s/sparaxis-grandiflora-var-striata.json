It features striking, tubular flowers that are typically bright yellow with red or orange markings, arranged in dense spikes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often striped or streaked with contrasting colors. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, usually in late winter to early spring."
