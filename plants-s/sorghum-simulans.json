    "intro": "Sorghum simulans, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of less than one meter, making it suitable for use as a forage crop or ornamental plant. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, pale green or yellow flowers. Sorghum simulans is adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated in regions with low rainfall."
