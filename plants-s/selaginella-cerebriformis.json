It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a distinctive, creeping stem with whorls of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it a unique, brain-like appearance. Selaginella cerebriformis reproduces via spores and is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions. Its intricate morphology and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
