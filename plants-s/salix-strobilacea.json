    "intro": "Salix strobilacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in wet meadows. Salix strobilacea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
