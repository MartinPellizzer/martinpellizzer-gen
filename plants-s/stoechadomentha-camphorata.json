    "intro": "Stoechadomentha camphorata, commonly known as camphor sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong camphor scent when crushed. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens. Its essential oils, rich in camphor and other compounds, have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
