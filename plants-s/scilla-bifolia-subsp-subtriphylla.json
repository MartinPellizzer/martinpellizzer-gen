    "intro": "Scilla bifolia subsp. subtriphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in woodland and grassland habitats, preferring well-drained, moist soils. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often arranged in a rosette. This subspecies is distinguished by its three-parted leaves, which give it its common name."
