It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and seaside cliffs. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and coastal landscapes."
