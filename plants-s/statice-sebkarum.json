    "intro": "Statice sebkarum, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species for erosion control. Statice sebkarum is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its historical use in floral arrangements."
