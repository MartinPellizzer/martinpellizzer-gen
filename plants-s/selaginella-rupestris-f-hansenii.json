    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, which is an adaptation to its often arid habitat. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil integrity."
