    "intro": "Sphaeromorphaea centipeda, commonly known as the spiral-stemmed orchid, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its spirally twisted stems and clustered, fragrant blooms. It belongs to the orchid family and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a complex root system that aids in nutrient absorption from its moist, shaded habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically white or pale pink and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, Sphaeromorphaea centipeda is considered a conservation concern in its natural range."
