It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Silene canescens thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and easily identifiable species within the Caryophyllaceae family."
