    "intro": "Stapelia paniculata, commonly known as the yellow starfish, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically short and spiny, providing additional protection. Stapelia paniculata is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
