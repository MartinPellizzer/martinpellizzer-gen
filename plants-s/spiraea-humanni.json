    "intro": "Spiraea humanni, commonly known as the alpine spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and remain green throughout the growing season before turning yellow in autumn. Spiraea humanni is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
