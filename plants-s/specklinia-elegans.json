    "intro": "Specklinia elegans, commonly known as the elegant speckled fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with small, dark speckles along the veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Specklinia elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical greenhouses and gardens."
