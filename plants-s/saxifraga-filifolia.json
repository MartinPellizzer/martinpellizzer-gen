    "intro": "Saxifraga filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Saxifraga filifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
