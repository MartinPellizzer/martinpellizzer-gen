    "intro": "Selaginella macrathera, commonly known as the climbing spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and spore-producing structures. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It is native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores for propagation."
