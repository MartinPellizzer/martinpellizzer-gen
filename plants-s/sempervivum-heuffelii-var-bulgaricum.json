The plant produces tall, flowering stalks in late summer, bearing small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
