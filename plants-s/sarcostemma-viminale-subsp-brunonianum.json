    "intro": "Sarcostemma viminale subsp. brunonianum, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its latex sap is milky and can be irritant, a common feature among plants in the Apocynaceae family. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
