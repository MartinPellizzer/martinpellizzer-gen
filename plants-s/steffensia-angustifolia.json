    "intro": "Steffensia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved steffensia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in a rounded head. Steffensia angustifolia is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
