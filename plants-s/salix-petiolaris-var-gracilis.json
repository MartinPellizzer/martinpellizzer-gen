    "intro": "Salix petiolaris var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
