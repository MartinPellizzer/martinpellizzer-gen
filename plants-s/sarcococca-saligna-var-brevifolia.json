    "intro": "Sarcococca saligna var. brevifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf winterberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern China. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing year-round interest in gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter, followed by red berries that persist into spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
