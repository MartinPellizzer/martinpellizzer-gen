    "intro": "Solanum multispinum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the grandiflorum nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features woody stems covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of ovate, pubescent leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The fruit is a globose berry that turns from green to yellow or red when mature, containing several seeds."
