    "intro": "Saxifraga terektensis, commonly known as the Karakoram saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Saxifraga terektensis is often found in rocky or alpine substrates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a notable species for studies on plant adaptation to extreme climates."
