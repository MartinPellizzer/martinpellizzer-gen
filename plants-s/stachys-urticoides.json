It features upright, square stems covered in fine hairs and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has serrated leaves that are often hairy and can resemble those of nettle plants, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Stachys urticoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
