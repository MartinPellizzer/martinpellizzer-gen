    "intro": "Silaus, commonly known as red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree species native to the dry regions of India. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood with a unique grain pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Silaus is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching up to 50 meters in height. Due to overexploitation, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
