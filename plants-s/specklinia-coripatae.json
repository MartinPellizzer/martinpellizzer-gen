    "intro": "Specklinia coripatae, commonly known as the coral spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. It features compact, pseudobulbous stems with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The flowers are small, fragrant, and usually pink or purple, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
