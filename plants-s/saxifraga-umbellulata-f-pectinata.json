    "intro": "Saxifraga umbellulata f. pectinata, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in an umbel, which gives it its species name. This plant is native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The hairy texture of its leaves helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
