    "intro": "Salix amnicola, commonly known as the stream willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and stream edges, where it helps stabilize the soil with its extensive root system. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. Salix amnicola is well adapted to moist, often flood-prone environments, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
