    "intro": "Sapindus fuscatus, commonly known as the black soapberry, is a small deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The fruit is a smooth, spiny capsule that turns from green to black as it matures. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a soapy substance when its fruits are crushed, which has been used traditionally for cleaning purposes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
