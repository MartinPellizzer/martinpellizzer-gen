    "intro": "Stipagrostis schaeferi, commonly known as the Schaefer's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in low, dense tussocks and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy component of steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry environments."
