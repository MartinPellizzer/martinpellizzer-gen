It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and riparian zones. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
