    "intro": "Salvertia, commonly known as the common spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia. Salvertia species are often found in dry, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. They are widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and Africa, with several species adapted to different climatic conditions."
