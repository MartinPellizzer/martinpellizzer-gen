    "intro": "Sauropus heteroblastus, commonly known as the variable-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive variation in leaf shape and size along its stem, a phenomenon known as heteroblasty. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments."
