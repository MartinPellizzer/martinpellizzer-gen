    "intro": "Senegalia langlassei, commonly known as the Langlasse's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in adult plants, a common adaptation to minimize water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common component of savanna ecosystems. Senegalia langlassei also has some traditional uses, including as a source of timber and forage."
