    "intro": "Salvia pinnata, commonly known as the pinnate sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a pinnate (feather-like) arrangement, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia pinnata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
