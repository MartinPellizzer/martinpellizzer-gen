    "intro": "Selaginella albociliata, commonly known as the white-haired spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a vascular plant characterized by its creeping, stem-like structure and small, scale-like leaves. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
