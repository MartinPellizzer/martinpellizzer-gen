    "intro": "Schoenus obtusifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved flaxgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and its wide, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
