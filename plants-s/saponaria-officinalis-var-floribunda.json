    "intro": "Saponaria officinalis var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of pink or red, bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. Its roots contain saponins, which give the plant its name and contribute to its historical use in soap-making and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens."
