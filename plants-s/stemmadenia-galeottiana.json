It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems with a smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in rocky areas and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
