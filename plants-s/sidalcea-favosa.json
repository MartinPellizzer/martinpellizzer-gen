    "intro": "Sidalcea favosa, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features upright stems with pinnately compound leaves that have a silvery-blue appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Sidalcea favosa is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects."
