    "intro": "Schollia viminalis, commonly known as the water willow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Schollia viminalis plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
