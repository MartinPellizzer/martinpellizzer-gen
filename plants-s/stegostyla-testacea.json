    "intro": "Stegostyla testacea, commonly known as the sea hare or the common sea hare, is a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant, more accurately a marine invertebrate, has a unique respiratory system that includes a gill and a mantle cavity. Its coloration can vary, often displaying shades of brown, yellow, or green, which helps it blend with its marine environment. Stegostyla testacea plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine predators."
