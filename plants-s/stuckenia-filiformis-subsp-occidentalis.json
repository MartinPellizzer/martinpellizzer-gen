    "intro": "Stuckenia filiformis subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as western slender waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize sediments. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
