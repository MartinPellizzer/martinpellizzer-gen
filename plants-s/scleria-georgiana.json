    "intro": "Scleria georgiana, commonly known as the Georgia sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its slender, triangular stems are covered in a dense layer of fine, grass-like leaves. Scleria georgiana produces small, three-parted flowers that are clustered in spikelets, characteristic of the sedge family."
