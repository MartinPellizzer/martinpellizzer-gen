It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its milky sap. Its growth habit and adaptability make it both a weed and a potential medicinal plant in traditional herbal medicine."
