    "intro": "Spiraea foliosa, commonly known as the leafy spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
