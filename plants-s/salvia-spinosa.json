    "intro": "Salvia spinosa, commonly known as Spanish sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fuzzy leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces spikes of violet or purple flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia spinosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
