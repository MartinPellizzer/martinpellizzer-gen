    "intro": "Stellaria vernalis, commonly known as the spring starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Stellaria vernalis is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in early spring, adding a subtle touch of color to the landscape."
