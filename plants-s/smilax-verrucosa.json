    "intro": "Smilax verrucosa, commonly known as the rough smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, waxy texture. Smilax verrucosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
