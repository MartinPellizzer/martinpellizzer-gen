    "intro": "Suaeda depressa, commonly known as dwarf seepweed, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has succulent leaves that store water, helping it survive in arid or salty conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Suaeda depressa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
