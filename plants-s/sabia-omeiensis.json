    "intro": "Sabia omeiensis, commonly known as the Omeian sabia, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a distinctive yellow throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Sabia omeiensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
