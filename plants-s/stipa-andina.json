    "intro": "Stipa andina, commonly known as Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to rocky and arid soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in mountainous regions, making it ecologically significant. Stipa andina is often used in traditional Andean agriculture and is valued for its resilience and ornamental qualities."
