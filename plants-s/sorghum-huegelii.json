    "intro": "Sorghum huegelii, commonly known as the tallgrass sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its robust root system, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sorghum huegelii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
