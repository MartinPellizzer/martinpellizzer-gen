    "intro": "Salsola cinerea, commonly known as silver leaf gooseweed, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in deserts, coastal areas, and disturbed sites. Salsola cinerea is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
