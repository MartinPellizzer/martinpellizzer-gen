    "intro": "Stellaria humifusa f. typica, commonly known as the common starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems that root at the nodes, creating a carpet-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Stellaria humifusa f. typica thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
