    "intro": "Scleria melaleuca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. Scleria melaleuca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
