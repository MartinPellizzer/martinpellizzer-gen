    "intro": "Senecio cathcartensis, commonly known as Cathcart's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
