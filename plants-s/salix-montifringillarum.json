    "intro": "Salix montifringillarum, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typically yellow-green in color, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas. Salix montifringillarum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
