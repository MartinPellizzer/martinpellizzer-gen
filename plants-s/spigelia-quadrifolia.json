    "intro": "Spigelia quadrifolia, commonly known as four-leaved spigelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that often appear in groups of four, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Spigelia quadrifolia thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, sandy soils."
