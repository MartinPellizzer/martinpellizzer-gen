    "intro": "Spartina stricta var. triplex, commonly known as the three-leaved cordgrass, is a halophyte native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline environments, such as tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has three leaves per node, a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other Spartina species. Its rhizomes form dense mats that stabilize soil and reduce erosion. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
