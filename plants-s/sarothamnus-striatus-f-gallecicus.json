It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
