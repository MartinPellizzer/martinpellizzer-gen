    "intro": "Swainsona katjarra, commonly known as the desert senna, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Swainsona katjarra is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-arid conditions."
