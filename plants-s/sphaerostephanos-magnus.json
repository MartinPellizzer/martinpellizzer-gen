    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos magnus, commonly known as the giant globe flower, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its large, spherical blooms. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is native to the high altitudes of the Andes. The plant features a short, thick stem with a single, showy inflorescence that resembles a globe, composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its botanical structure includes compound leaves with a distinctive, lobed appearance, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
