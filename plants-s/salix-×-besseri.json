It is a natural hybrid between Salix laevigata and Salix discolor, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and forest edges. Its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves are distinctive features. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance for pollinators."
