    "intro": "Sida compressa, commonly known as seaside cotton or sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dunes and other coastal habitats. The plant has small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Sida compressa is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
