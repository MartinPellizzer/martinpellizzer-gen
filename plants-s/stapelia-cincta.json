    "intro": "Stapelia cincta, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that resemble insects, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting flies. Its leaves are typically small and sparsely arranged, contributing to its compact appearance. Stapelia cincta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique ornamental qualities."
