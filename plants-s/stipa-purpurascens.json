    "intro": "Stipa purpurascens, commonly known as purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments with low precipitation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in the autumn. Stipa purpurascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
