    "intro": "Salix myrsinites, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, often wet environments. Its bark is fibrous and peels in thin layers, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The silver willow is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian zones."
