    "intro": "Selaginella moritziana var. suberecta, commonly known as the upright spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and erect, spore-bearing stems. It has small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) at the tips of the branches, which are responsible for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value."
