It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
