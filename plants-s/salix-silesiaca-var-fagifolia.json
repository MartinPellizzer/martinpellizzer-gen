    "intro": "Salix silesiaca var. fagifolia, commonly known as the Fagifolia willow, is a variant of the Silesian willow native to parts of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
