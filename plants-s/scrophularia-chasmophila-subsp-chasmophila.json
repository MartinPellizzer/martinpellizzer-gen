    "intro": "Scrophularia chasmophila subsp. chasmophila, commonly known as the crevice scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and limestone habitats in the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in crevices and on rock faces, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear opposite, oval leaves. It produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is noted for its adaptability to harsh, dry environments and is often found in open, sunny microhabitats."
