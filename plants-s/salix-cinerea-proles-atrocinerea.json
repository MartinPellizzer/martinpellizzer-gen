    "intro": "Salix cinerea proles atrocinerea, commonly known as black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark, often fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it thrives in moist, temperate environments. It is often found along riverbanks and in wet woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
