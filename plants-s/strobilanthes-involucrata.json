    "intro": "Strobilanthes involucrata, commonly known as the \"Khasi flame flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant is part of the Acanthaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure, which includes small, tubular flowers clustered beneath the showy bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
