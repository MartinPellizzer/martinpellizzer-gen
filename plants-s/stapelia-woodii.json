    "intro": "Stapelia woodii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decay. These flowers bloom in the early morning and remain open for only a few days. Stapelia woodii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xerophytic gardens."
