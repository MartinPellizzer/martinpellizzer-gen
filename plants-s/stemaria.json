    "intro": "Stemaria, commonly known as the \"buttercup of the desert,\" is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the genus Stemaria in the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with woody stems that become covered in a thick layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, spiny fruits that protect the seeds. Stemaria is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and drought-resistant characteristics."
