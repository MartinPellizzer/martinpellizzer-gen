    "intro": "Serratula strangulata, commonly known as the strangling serratula, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
