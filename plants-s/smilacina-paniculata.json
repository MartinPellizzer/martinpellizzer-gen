    "intro": "Smilacina paniculata, commonly known as wild cucumber, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white, waxy coating on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into spiny, green fruits. These fruits turn yellow or red when mature and are often eaten by birds and small mammals. Smilacina paniculata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
