    "intro": "Salix floderusii, commonly known as the Floderus willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
