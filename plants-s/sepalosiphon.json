    "intro": "Sepalosiphon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that surround the flower clusters, giving it a unique appearance. The flowers are typically small and white or greenish, arranged in umbels, and are often mistaken for sea urchins due to their appearance. Sepalosiphon species are found primarily in coastal areas and thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can tolerate saline conditions."
