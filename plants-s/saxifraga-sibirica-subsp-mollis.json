    "intro": "Saxifraga sibirica subsp. mollis, commonly known as the soft saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, upright stalks. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
