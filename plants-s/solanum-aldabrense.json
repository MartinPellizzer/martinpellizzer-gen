    "intro": "Solanum aldabrense, commonly known as the Aldabra nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its woody stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces violet-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
