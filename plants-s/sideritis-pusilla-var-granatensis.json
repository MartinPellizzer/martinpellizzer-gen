    "intro": "Sideritis pusilla var. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense Heath, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
