    "intro": "Solanum oporinum, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. Solanum oporinum thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
