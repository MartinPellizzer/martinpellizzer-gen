    "intro": "Stemonurus hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan stemona, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Stemonaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
