    "intro": "Spergularia marina var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled sea sandwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, including salt marshes and sandy shores, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red. Its growth habit is prostrate or semi-upright, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. This variety is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often found in the intertidal zones of temperate regions."
