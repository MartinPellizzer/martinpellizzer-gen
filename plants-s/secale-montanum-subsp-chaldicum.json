It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
