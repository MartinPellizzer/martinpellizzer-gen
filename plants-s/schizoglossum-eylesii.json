    "intro": "Schizoglossum eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' schizoglossum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. Schizoglossum eylesii is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
