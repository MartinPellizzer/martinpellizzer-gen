    "intro": "Sphaeropteris leucolepis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, and has a long lifespan, often living for several decades. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
