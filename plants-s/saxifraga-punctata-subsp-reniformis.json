    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata subsp. reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are typically kidney-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga punctata subsp. reniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
