    "intro": "Saxifraga geranioides var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of thick, waxy, obovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a valued species in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
