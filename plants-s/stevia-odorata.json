    "intro": "Stevia odorata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees. Stevia odorata is widely cultivated as a natural sweetener and is valued for its low-calorie, non-nutritive properties."
