    "intro": "Specularia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered spectacle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Specularia biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
