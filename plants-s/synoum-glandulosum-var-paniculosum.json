    "intro": "Synoum glandulosum var. paniculosum, commonly known as the glandular synoum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the warmer months. The glandular structures on its leaves are thought to play a role in water retention and possibly in deterring herbivores."
