    "intro": "Schoenus subaphyllus var. barbulatus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or muddy soils. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy structures compared to the typical form of Schoenus subaphyllus."
