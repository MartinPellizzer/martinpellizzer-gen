    "intro": "Seseli desertorum, commonly known as the desert sesame, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Seseli desertorum is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
