It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, star-shaped berries. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in pastures and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many areas."
