    "intro": "Salix tenuior, commonly known as the slender willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. Salix tenuior thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
