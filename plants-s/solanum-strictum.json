    "intro": "Solanum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, often spiny stems and small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. Its berries are typically yellow or red when ripe and contain toxic alkaloids. Solanum strictum is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some regions."
