    "intro": "Setaria trichorhachis, commonly known as wild millet, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, beige-colored grains. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used as a forage crop or in ecological restoration projects."
