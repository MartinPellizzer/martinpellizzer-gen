    "intro": "Stelis bracteolenta, commonly known as the bracteolent orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, often pendulous stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Stelis bracteolenta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
