    "intro": "Salvia hirta, commonly known as purpletop, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Salvia hirta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees and other pollinators, enhancing its ecological value in native gardens."
