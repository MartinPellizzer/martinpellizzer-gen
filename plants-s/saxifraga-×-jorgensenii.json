    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 jorgensenii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific care requirements."
