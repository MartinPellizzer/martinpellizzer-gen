    "intro": "Stellilabium cuscoense, commonly known as the Cusco star-labium, is a rare and unique orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that are often a vibrant mix of yellow and orange, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Stellilabium cuscoense is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
