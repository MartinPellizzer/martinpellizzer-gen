    "intro": "Saxifraga montana f. densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved mountain saxifrage, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features dense, rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, often clustered at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
