    "intro": "Sophronitis pendula, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red. Sophronitis pendula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
