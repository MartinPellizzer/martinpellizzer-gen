    "intro": "Senecio linearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and elongated, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
