    "intro": "Saponaria prostrata subsp. prostrata, commonly known as creeping soapwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
