    "intro": "Senecio clevelandii var. heterophyllus, commonly known as Cleveland's ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and variable leaf shapes, which contribute to its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal climates with mild, wet winters. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to produce a large number of small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
