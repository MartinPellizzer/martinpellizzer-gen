    "intro": "Sium virens, commonly known as water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies such as streams and ponds. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often harvested for their edible qualities, though they can be somewhat bitter. Sium virens plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
