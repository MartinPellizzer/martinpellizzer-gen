    "intro": "Squamopappus skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's squamopappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, scale-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and yellow, contributing to its role as a nectar source for local pollinators."
