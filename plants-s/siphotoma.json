    "intro": "Siphotoma, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble small thistles. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in coastal environments. Siphotoma has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, helping it adapt to salty air. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
