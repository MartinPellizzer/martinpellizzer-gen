It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated or lobed margin. The plant is known for containing toxic compounds, including strychnine, which makes it a subject of both botanical and pharmacological interest."
