    "intro": "Solanum gracilifrons, commonly known as the slender-fruited nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, oval berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic compounds typical of the Solanum genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers."
