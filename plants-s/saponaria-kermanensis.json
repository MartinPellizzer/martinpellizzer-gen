It belongs to the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae, and is characterized by its clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which can produce a frothy lather when mixed with water. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Saponaria kermanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
