    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rubella, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green on the upper surface and silvery white underneath, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, fluffy catkins in the spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Salix \u00d7 rubella is widely cultivated for its aesthetic value and is often used in landscaping and riparian restoration projects."
