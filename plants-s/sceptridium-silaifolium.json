    "intro": "Sceptridium silaifolium, commonly known as the silvery-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Sceptridium silaifolium is considered endangered in its natural range."
