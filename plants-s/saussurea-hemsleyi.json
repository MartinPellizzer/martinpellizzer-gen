    "intro": "Saussurea hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley's snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea hemsleyi is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
