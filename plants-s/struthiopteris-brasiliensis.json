    "intro": "Struthiopteris brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian sword fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer, and its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a distinctive, sword-like shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, tropical forests. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
