    "intro": "Salix nepetifolia, commonly known as the cat's foot willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Salix nepetifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
