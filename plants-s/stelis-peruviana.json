    "intro": "Stelis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with narrow, linear leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
