    "intro": "Sabadilla intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, and its berries are toxic if ingested. Sabadilla intermedia is notable for its alkaloid content, which has been historically used in medicinal and contraceptive applications. However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption without professional guidance."
