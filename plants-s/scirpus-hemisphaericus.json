    "intro": "Scirpus hemisphaericus, commonly known as the marsh arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its triangular, ribbed stems and arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically emerging from the water surface in late summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Scirpus hemisphaericus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing soil along water bodies."
