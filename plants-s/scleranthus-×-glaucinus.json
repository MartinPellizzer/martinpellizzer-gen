It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
