    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus kurdicus, commonly known as the Kurdish globe lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive rounded, globe-like thallus that is typically yellowish to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component, which together thrive on rock surfaces. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to mycologists and botanists studying lichen diversity and ecological adaptations."
