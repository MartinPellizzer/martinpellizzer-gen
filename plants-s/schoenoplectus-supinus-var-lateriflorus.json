    "intro": "Schoenoplectus supinus var. lateriflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets along the upper part of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and they are often submerged or partially submerged in water. This variant is distinguished by its lateral flowering pattern, which sets it apart from other varieties within the Schoenoplectus genus."
