    "intro": "Stenactis multiradiata, commonly known as the radiate sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the family Actinidiidae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent polyps and a distinctive, crown-like arrangement of tentacles. The organism typically inhabits shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its radial symmetry and specialized feeding structures are adaptations to its sessile lifestyle in the intertidal zone. The species plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
