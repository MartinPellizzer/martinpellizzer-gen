    "intro": "Solanum plebeium var. grossedentatum, commonly known as the giant toothed nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, toothed leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its berries, which are yellow when mature, contain toxic alkaloids and are not suitable for human consumption. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
