    "intro": "Scorzoneroides montana subsp. montaniformis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and tall, slender stems that bear bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
