    "intro": "Sphenotoma dracophylloides, commonly known as the dragon-leaf sphenotoma, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Sphenotomaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble dragon scales, hence its common name. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with small, clustered flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphenotoma dracophylloides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
