    "intro": "Solanum pygmaeum var. sinuatodentatum, commonly known as the narrow-toothed nightshade, is a rare and small herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
