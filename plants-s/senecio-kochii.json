    "intro": "Senecio kochii, commonly known as the coastal senecio, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. Senecio kochii is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
