    "intro": "Selliguea dactylina, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a terrestrial, non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thallus that is dorsiventral, with a distinct upper and lower surface, and it produces sporangia on specialized structures called sorocarps. Selliguea dactylina is characterized by its leaf-like structures, which are arranged in a rosette pattern and have a smooth, waxy surface. This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
