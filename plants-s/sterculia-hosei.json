    "intro": "Sterculia hosei, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain flat, seed-like structures called arils. It is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
