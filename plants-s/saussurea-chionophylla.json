    "intro": "Saussurea chionophylla, commonly known as the snow-leaf saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the short summer season. Its leaves are dense, woolly, and adapted to reduce water loss in arid, alpine conditions. Saussurea chionophylla is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
