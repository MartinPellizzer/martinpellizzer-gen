    "intro": "Schizachyrium iringense, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically tan to brown in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils in wetlands and along stream banks. Schizachyrium iringense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
