    "intro": "Scirpus microcarpus f. radiosus, commonly known as the radiate bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that radiates outward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments such as marshes and pond edges. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that aids in its survival in aquatic conditions. The radiate form of its flowers makes it easily distinguishable from other bulrush species."
