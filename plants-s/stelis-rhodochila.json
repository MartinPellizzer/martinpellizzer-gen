    "intro": "Stelis rhodochila, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Stelis rhodochila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
