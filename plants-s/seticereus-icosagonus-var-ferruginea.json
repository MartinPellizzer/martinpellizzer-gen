    "intro": "Seticereus icosagonus var. ferruginea, commonly known as the Crimson Nightshade or Red Candelabra Cactus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching structure and clusters of vibrant red flowers that bloom at night. The plant features thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in cacti for reducing water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, sunny climates."
