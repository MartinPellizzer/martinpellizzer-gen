    "intro": "Stemonurus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf stemonurus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Stemonurus ellipticus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats."
