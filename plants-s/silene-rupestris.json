It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in crevices and on limestone, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Silene rupestris is often found in alpine and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
