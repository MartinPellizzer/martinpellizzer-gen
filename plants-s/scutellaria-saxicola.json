    "intro": "Scutellaria saxicola, commonly known as the rock skullcup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Scutellaria saxicola is a member of the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
