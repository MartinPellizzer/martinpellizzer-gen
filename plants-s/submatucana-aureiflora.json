    "intro": "Submatucana aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered submatucana, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, showy flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
