    "intro": "Stipagrostis zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Stipagrostis zeyheri is valued for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
