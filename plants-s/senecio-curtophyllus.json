    "intro": "Senecio curtophyllus, commonly known as the short-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of silver-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a daisy-like pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
