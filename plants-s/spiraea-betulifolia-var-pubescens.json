    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, arching stems. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 3 feet. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and early blooming habit."
