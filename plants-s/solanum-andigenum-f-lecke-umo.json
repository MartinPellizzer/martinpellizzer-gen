    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. lecke-umo, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a variant of the Solanum genus native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, purple to black berries that are typically toxic to humans but may be used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
