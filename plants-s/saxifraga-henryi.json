    "intro": "Saxifraga henryi, commonly known as the Chinese saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
