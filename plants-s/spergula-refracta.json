    "intro": "Spergula refracta, commonly known as narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has fine, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Spergula refracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
