    "intro": "Syntherisma distans, commonly known as the distant syntherism, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syntherisma distans is considered a vulnerable species."
