    "intro": "Solidago pumila, commonly known as dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its clustered, small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has fibrous roots and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or prairie habitats. Solidago pumila plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
