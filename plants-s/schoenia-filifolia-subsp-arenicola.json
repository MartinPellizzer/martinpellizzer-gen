    "intro": "Schoenia filifolia subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the base of the leaf sheaths. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. This subspecies is often used for erosion control in degraded landscapes."
