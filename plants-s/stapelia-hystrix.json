    "intro": "Stapelia hystrix, commonly known as the hooked stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, warty, and often spiny stems that resemble the appearance of a cactus. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh. These flowers bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by flies and beetles. Stapelia hystrix is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
