    "intro": "Scyphogyne brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved scyphogyne, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, broad leaves and striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense rainforest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scyphogyne brevifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
