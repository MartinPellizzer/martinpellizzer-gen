    "intro": "Swertia angustifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf gentian, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of medicinal compounds and its ecological value in mountain ecosystems."
