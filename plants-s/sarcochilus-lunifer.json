    "intro": "Sarcochilus lunifer, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, moon-shaped pseudobulbs and broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a deep purple lip, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shady, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Sarcochilus lunifer is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
