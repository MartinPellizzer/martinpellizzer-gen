    "intro": "Stellaria papillata, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has thin, spreading stems covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with tiny, raised bumps or papillae, which contribute to its scientific name. Stellaria papillata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
