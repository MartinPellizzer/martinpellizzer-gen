    "intro": "Sturmia paludosa, commonly known as the bog sturmia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs and fens. The plant features slender, often prostrate stems covered with small, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white to pale pink petals, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Sturmia paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is an indicator species for acidic, waterlogged habitats."
