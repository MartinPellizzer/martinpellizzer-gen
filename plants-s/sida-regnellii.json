    "intro": "Sida regnellii, commonly known as the silverleaf sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Sida regnellii is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
