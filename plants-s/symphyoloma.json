    "intro": "Symphyoloma, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and mountainous regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Symphyoloma species are typically shrubs or small trees, often with rough, hairy stems and broad, leathery leaves. These plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought and heat."
