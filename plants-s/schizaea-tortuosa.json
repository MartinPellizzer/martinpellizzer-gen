    "intro": "Schizaea tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted whisk fern, is a member of the family Psilotaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots. It possesses a creeping rhizome with whorls of spirally arranged sporangiophores that bear spores. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is an ancient lineage of ferns, dating back to the Carboniferous period. Its unique morphology and primitive features make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution."
