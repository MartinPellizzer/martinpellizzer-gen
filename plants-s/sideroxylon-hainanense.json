    "intro": "Sideroxylon hainanense, commonly known as Hainan ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, featuring thick, ridged bark and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces woody capsules as fruits. Due to its unique botanical features and limited distribution, it is considered an important species for ecological and conservation studies."
