It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxicity. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and geographic distribution compared to other Scilla species."
