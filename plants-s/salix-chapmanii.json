    "intro": "Salix chapmanii, commonly known as Chapmann's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian areas. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. Salix chapmanii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and support local wildlife."
