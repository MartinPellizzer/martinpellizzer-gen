    "intro": "Soldanella parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved soldanella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and clustered flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
