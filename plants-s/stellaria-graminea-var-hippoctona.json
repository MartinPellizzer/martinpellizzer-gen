    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. hippoctona, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, often with five petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its resemblance to grass species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wet meadows."
