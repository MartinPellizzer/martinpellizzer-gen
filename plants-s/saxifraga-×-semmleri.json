    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 semmleri, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a hybrid plant native to the Alps. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, rocky habitat. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers in late winter or early spring, often around Christmas, hence its common name. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
