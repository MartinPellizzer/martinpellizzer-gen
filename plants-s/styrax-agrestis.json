    "intro": "Styrax agrestis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark purple, waxy berries. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it often has a reddish or brownish hue. Styrax agrestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
