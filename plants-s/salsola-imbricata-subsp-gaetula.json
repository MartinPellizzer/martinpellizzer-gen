    "intro": "Salsola imbricata subsp. gaetula, commonly known as the desert goosefoot, is a perennial halophytic plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and disturbed areas. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
