    "intro": "Schmidtottia cubensis subsp. cristalensis, commonly known as the Cuban Schmidottia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Cuba. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in rocky or limestone soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark blue to black berries that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
