    "intro": "Sapindus oblongus, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its fruit is notable for its ability to produce a soapy lather when crushed, which has been traditionally used for cleaning purposes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
