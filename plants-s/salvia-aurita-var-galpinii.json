    "intro": "Salvia aurita var. galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
