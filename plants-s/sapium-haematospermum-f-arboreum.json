    "intro": "Sapium haematospermum f. arboreum, commonly known as the redseed Chinese tallowtree, is a variant of the Chinese tallowtree native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive red, woody fruits containing seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall foliage and unique seed pods. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
