    "intro": "Silene filipetala subsp. filipetala, commonly known as the Filipetan catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
