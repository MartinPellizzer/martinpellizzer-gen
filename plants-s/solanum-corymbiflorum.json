    "intro": "Solanum corymbiflorum, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis peruviana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant orange, lantern-shaped fruit that encloses the seeds. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The fruit is edible when ripe, though the skin is usually too tough to eat and is often discarded."
