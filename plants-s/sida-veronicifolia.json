    "intro": "Sida veronicifolia, commonly known as blueweed or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found along shorelines. The plant features small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are usually ovate with a rough texture. Sida veronicifolia has a shallow root system and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
