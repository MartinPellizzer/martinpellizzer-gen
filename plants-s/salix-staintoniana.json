    "intro": "Salix staintoniana, commonly known as Stainton's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, triangular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in rocky or marginal environments."
