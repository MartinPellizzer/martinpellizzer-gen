    "intro": "Salix bothnica, commonly known as the Bothnian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and coastal areas. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a serrated margin. Salix bothnica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
