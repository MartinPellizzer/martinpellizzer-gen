    "intro": "Sempervivum transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian houseleek, is a low-growing, evergreen succulent native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ability to thrive in poor soil and drought conditions adds to its horticultural appeal."
