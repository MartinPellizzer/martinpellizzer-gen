    "intro": "Saraca elegans, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking orange-red floral display, which appears in clusters during the spring. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Saraca elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
