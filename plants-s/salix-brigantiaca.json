    "intro": "Salix brigantiaca, commonly known as the Mongolian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Salix brigantiaca is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
