    "intro": "Schoenus subaphyllus var. kennyi, commonly known as the Kenny's flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense mats on the soil surface. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in its natural environment. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
