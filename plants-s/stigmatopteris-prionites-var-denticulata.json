    "intro": "Stigmatopteris prionites var. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern family with distinctive fronds. It features finely toothed margins on its lanceolate, compound leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, feathery appearance."
