    "intro": "Schismatoglottis tahubangensis, commonly known as the Bornean Schismatoglottis, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
