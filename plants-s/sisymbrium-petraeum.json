    "intro": "Sisymbrium petraeum, commonly known as the rock pepper or mountain mustard, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and linear, hairy leaves adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces slender, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or gravelly habitats. Sisymbrium petraeum plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and supports local insect populations."
