    "intro": "Scirpus expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are broad and flat, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Scirpus expansus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
