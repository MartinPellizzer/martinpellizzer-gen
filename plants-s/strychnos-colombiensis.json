    "intro": "Strychnos colombiensis, commonly known as the Colombian nux vomica, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its roots and seeds contain toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which have been historically used in medicine and as poisons. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for research and traditional use."
