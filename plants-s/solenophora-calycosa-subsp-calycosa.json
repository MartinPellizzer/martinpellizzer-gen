It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is characterized by its robust root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
