    "intro": "Setaria decipiens f. major, commonly known as the giant false panicgrass, is a tall, grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it is distinguished by its fibrous root system and the presence of distinct leaf sheaths."
