    "intro": "Sarcochilus wightii, commonly known as the Wight's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green, translucent leaves and a single, elongated flower spike. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus wightii is considered a conservation concern."
