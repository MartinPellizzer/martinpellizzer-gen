    "intro": "Schefflera serrata, commonly known as the serrated umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, leathery, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Schefflera serrata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in indoor environments. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
