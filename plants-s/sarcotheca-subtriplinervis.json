It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive three-veined leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. The botanical features of Sarcotheca subtriplinervis make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
