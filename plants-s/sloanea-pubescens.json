    "intro": "Sloanea pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Sloanea pubescens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
