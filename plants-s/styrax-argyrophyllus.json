    "intro": "Styrax argyrophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white or pale waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic resins."
