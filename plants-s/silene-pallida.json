It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Silene pallida is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, growing in open habitats such as tundra and mountain slopes. It is an important species in ecological studies due to its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
