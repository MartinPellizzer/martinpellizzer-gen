It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, reaching heights of up to 40 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
