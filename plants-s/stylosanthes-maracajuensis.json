    "intro": "Stylosanthes maracajuensis, commonly known as the Maracaju stylo, is a leguminous plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This species is also valued for forage and as a cover crop in agricultural systems."
