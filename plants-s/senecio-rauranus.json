    "intro": "Senecio rauranus, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Senecio rauranus plays a role in stabilizing alpine soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
