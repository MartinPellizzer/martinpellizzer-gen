    "intro": "Selago glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and flowers adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and often pink or white, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Selago glabrata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops."
