    "intro": "Sarcococca, commonly known as sweetbox, is a genus of evergreen shrubs belonging to the family Lauraceae. These plants are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and are valued for their dense, compact growth habit. Sarcococca species are characterized by their dark evergreen foliage and fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The berries that follow the flowers are typically small, black, and ornamental, adding visual interest in the winter months. They are often used in horticulture for their ability to thrive in shaded conditions and their low maintenance requirements."
