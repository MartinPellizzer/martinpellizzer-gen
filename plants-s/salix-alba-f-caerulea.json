    "intro": "Salix alba f. caerulea, commonly known as the blue willow, is a cultivar of the white willow tree. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which develops due to a dense layer of epicuticular wax on the leaf surface. This feature gives it a unique appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in garden settings for its aesthetic appeal."
