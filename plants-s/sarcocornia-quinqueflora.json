    "intro": "Sarcocornia quinqueflora, commonly known as the five-flowered glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions makes it an important component of estuarine ecosystems."
