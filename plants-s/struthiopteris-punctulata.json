    "intro": "Struthiopteris punctulata, commonly known as the dotted wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments with a pale, often reddish-brown margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Struthiopteris punctulata is a perennial plant that plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
