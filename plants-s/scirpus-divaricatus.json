    "intro": "Scirpus divaricatus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Its leaves are narrow and upright, often forming tussocks that provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Scirpus divaricatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and maintaining water quality."
