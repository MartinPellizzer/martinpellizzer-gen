    "intro": "Sterculia monosperma var. monosperma, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in construction and furniture, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
