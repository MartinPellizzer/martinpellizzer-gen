    "intro": "Saponaria ocymoides var. nitidifolia, commonly known as the glossy leaf soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface, which distinguishes it from other varieties of saponaria. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its common name reflects the presence of saponins, which produce a soapy lather when the leaves are crushed."
