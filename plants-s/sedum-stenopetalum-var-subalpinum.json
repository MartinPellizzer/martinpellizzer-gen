It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and can thrive in full sun. Its leaves are typically blue-green and covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging garden conditions."
