    "intro": "Stipella parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered stipella, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with fine, linear lobes that give it a feathery appearance. Stipella parviflora is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
