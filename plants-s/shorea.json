    "intro": "Shorea, commonly known as the tropical hardwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Dipterocarpaceae. These trees are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their tall, straight trunks and dense, durable wood. Shorea species are typically evergreen and can grow up to 50 meters in height, with broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are often opposite or whorled. They play a crucial role in tropical rainforest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to carbon sequestration. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are economically important for timber and other forest products."
