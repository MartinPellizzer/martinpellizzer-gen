    "intro": "Salix melanopsis, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Salix melanopsis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
