    "intro": "Simarouba glauca, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils. The tree plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems and is also valued for its timber and medicinal properties."
