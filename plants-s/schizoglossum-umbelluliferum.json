    "intro": "Schizoglossum umbelluliferum, commonly known as the umbrella lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a distinctive, leaf-like structure with a lobed appearance. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are arranged in clusters that give it a unique, umbrella-like appearance. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
