    "intro": "Scolopendrium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features whorled leaves that are narrow and strap-like, and it produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores. Scolopendrium balansae is characterized by its unique reproductive system, which involves both male and female structures on the same plant. This species is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and its role in understanding the evolution of early land plants."
