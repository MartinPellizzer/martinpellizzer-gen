    "intro": "Salix interior, commonly known as the interior willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. Salix interior is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
