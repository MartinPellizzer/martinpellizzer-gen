    "intro": "Stellaria paludicola, commonly known as the marsh starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in peat bogs, marshes, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Stellaria paludicola plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
