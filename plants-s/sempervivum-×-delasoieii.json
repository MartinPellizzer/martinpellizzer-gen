    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 delasoieii, commonly known as the hybrid hens and chicks, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Sempervivum arachnoideum and Sempervivum tectorum. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that forms dense rosettes of fleshy, sometimes hairy leaves. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments. Its flowers are typically red or pink and appear in clusters at the center of the rosette. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
