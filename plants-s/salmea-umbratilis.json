    "intro": "Salmea umbratilis, commonly known as the shadowy salmea, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the shaded undergrowth of temperate forests. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, delicate leaves that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the damp forest floor. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Salmea umbratilis is considered endangered and is often difficult to locate in the wild."
