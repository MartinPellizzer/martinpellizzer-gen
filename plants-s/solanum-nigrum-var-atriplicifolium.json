    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. atriplicifolium, commonly known as black nightshade with parsley-like leaves, is a variant of the common black nightshade. It is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves that resemble parsley. The plant produces small, black berries that are typically toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in gardens, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other Solanum species."
