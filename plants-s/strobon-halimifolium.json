    "intro": "Strobon halimifolium, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions. Strobon halimifolium plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
