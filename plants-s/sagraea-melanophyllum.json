    "intro": "Sagraea melanophyllum, commonly known as the black-leaved sagraea, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle contrast to its dark leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
