    "intro": "Schoenus aristatus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus aristatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
