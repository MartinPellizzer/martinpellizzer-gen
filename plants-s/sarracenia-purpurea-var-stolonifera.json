    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous purple pitcher plant, is a variant of the purple pitcher plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in acidic, boggy soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are typically red or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure that protects the reproductive organs. This variant is notable for its ability to spread via stolons, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
