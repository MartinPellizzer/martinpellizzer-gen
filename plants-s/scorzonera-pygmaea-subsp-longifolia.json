    "intro": "Scorzonera pygmaea subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the dwarf scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely hairy, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often contains a mild, edible tuberous root, though it is less commonly consumed than other scorzonera species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
