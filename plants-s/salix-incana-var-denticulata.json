    "intro": "Salix incana var. denticulata, commonly known as the rough sandbar willow, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its grayish-barked stems and narrow, willow-like leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems."
