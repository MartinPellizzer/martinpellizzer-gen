    "intro": "Squilla anthericoides, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Squilla anthericoides is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions."
