    "intro": "Simicratea welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the early morning. This species is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years."
