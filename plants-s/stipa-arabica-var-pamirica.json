    "intro": "Stipa arabica var. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous regions with poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
