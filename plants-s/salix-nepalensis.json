    "intro": "Salix nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. Salix nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
