    "intro": "Sabulina mesogitana subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sabulina, is a rare endemic plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the dry conditions of its environment. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
