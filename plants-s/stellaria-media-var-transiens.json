    "intro": "Stellaria media var. transiens, commonly known as the transient mouse-ear or transient chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and garden beds. This variant is distinguished by its shorter flowering period compared to the typical Stellaria media."
