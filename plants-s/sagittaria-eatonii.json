    "intro": "Sagittaria eatonii, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that rise above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Sagittaria eatonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life."
