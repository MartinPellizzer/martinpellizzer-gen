    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 nobrei nothosubsp. carloscostae, commonly known as the Carlos Costae willow, is a hybrid species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to the mild, coastal climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it exhibits traits that make it resilient to environmental stressors such as salt spray and periodic flooding."
