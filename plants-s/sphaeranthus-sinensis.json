    "intro": "Sphaeranthus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sandmat, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeranthus sinensis is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
