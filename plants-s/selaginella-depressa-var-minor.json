    "intro": "Selaginella depressa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained environments. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are borne on the underside of the leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xerophytic landscapes."
