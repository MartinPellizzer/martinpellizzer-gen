    "intro": "Scleria dictyocarpa, commonly known as the net-veined bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and along waterways. Scleria dictyocarpa is often found in shallow water or damp soil, where it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland habitats."
