    "intro": "Scirpus germanicus, commonly known as the German bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in saturated soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus germanicus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
