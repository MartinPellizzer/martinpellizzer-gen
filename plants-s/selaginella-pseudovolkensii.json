    "intro": "Selaginella pseudovolkensii, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a prostrate or ascending stem with spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like or needle-like in appearance. It produces strobila (cone-like structures) that contain spores, a characteristic feature of its life cycle. Selaginella pseudovolkensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
