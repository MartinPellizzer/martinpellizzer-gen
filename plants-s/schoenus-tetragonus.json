    "intro": "Schoenus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-cornered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas and riverbanks. Its small, clustered flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces small, three-sided fruits. Schoenus tetragonus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
