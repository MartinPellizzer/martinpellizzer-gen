    "intro": "Styphelia semiopposita, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its dense foliage. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form, typical of many Ericaceae family members. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Styphelia semiopposita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
