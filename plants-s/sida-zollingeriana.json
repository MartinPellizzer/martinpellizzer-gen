    "intro": "Sida zollingeriana, commonly known as Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its fibrous roots and woody structure make it adaptable to various soil types and climates. Sida zollingeriana is often found in dry, disturbed areas and is used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties."
