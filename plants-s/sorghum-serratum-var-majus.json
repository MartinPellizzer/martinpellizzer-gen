    "intro": "Sorghum serratum var. majus, commonly known as the giant serrated sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, serrated leaves and sturdy, branched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its height and hardiness, it is often used as a ornamental plant or for erosion control in suitable climates."
