    "intro": "Sempervivum galicicum, commonly known as the French houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Sempervivum galicicum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
