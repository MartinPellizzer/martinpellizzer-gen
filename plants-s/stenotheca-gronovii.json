    "intro": "Stenotheca gronovii, commonly known as the Greenland lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its dense, dark green to blackish thallus, which is typically found on rock surfaces or tree bark. The plant lacks distinct leaves and flowers, instead relying on its symbiotic association with algae or cyanobacteria for nutrition. It is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Stenotheca gronovii plays a vital role in ecological succession and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
