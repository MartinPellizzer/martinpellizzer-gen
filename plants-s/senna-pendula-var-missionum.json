    "intro": "Senna pendula var. missionum, commonly known as the Mexican coffee tree, is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its compound, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing small, dark seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a landscape plant."
