    "intro": "Stipa macrathera, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Stipa macrathera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
