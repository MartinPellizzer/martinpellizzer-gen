    "intro": "Statice trigona, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, colorful flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ability to add color to sandy or rocky landscapes. Statice trigona is also valued for its use in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
