    "intro": "Saxifraga nidifica, commonly known as the nest-building saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are characterized by their serrated edges and hairy texture. Saxifraga nidifica is well adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures."
