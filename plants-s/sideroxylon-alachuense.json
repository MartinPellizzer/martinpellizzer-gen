It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
