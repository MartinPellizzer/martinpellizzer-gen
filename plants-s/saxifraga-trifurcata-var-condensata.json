    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata var. condensata, commonly known as the dense saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
