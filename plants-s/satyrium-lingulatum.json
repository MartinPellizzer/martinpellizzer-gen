    "intro": "Satyrium lingulatum, commonly known as the lingulate orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features a slender stem with a single, narrow leaf and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its flowers are usually less than 1 cm in size, making it a subtle yet elegant member of the orchid family. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in association with other rare and specialized flora."
