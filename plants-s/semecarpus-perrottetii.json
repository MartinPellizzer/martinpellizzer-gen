    "intro": "Semecarpus perrottetii, commonly known as the Himalayan ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
