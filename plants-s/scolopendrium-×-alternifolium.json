    "intro": "Scolopendrium \u00d7 alternifolium, commonly known as the cross-leaved holly fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Scolopendrium cernuum and Scolopendrium vulgare. It features distinctive, alternate, and often deeply lobed fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dark green color, making it a visually striking ornamental plant."
