    "intro": "Seddera repens, commonly known as creeping seddera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Seddera repens is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
