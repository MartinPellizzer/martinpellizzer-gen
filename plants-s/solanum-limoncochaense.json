    "intro": "Solanum limoncochaense, commonly known as the Peruvian yellow nightshade, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is adapted to grow in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellow berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native habitat."
