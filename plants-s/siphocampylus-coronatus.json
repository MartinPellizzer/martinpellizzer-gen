    "intro": "Siphocampylus coronatus, commonly known as the crown beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Siphocampylus coronatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
