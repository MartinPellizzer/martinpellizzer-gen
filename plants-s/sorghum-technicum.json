    "intro": "Sorghum technicum, commonly known as millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is an annual plant that produces small, clustered inflorescences called panicles, which contain tiny grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable crop in arid environments. Its seeds are rich in carbohydrates and are used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production. Sorghum technicum is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
