    "intro": "Scirpus alboater, commonly known as white-tongued bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically borne on spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Scirpus alboater plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
