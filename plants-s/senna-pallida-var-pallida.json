    "intro": "Senna pallida var. pallida, commonly known as the pale senna, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Senna pallida var. pallida is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments."
