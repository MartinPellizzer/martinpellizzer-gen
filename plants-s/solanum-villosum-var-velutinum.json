    "intro": "Solanum villosum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, glandular leaves that are typically oval to ovate in shape, with a velvety texture due to the dense pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple or black color. It is often found in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
