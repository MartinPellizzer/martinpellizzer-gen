    "intro": "Salaxis major, commonly known as the large salax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces oval, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, Salaxis major is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
