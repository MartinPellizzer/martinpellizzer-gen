    "intro": "Staurogyne bella var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-armed water primrose, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in water environments. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging above the water surface. This variety is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
