    "intro": "Sporobolus discosporus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The seeds are dispersed by the plant's ability to eject them forcefully, a trait known as ballistic dispersal."
