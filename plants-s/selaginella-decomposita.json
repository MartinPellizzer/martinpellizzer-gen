    "intro": "Selaginella decomposita, commonly known as the decomposing spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology and adaptations. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with whorled, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selaginella decomposita is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its capacity to form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are borne on specialized branches, contributing to its role in ecological succession."
