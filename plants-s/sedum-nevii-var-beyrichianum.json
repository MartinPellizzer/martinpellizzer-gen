    "intro": "Sedum nevii var. beyrichianum, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often growing at elevations above 1,000 meters."
