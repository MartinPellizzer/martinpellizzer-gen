    "intro": "Selaginella maxima, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its long, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Selaginella maxima reproduces via spores and is often found in rocky soils or on limestone outcrops. Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh environments make it an important component of its ecological community."
