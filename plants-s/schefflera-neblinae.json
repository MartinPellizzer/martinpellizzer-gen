    "intro": "Schefflera neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest schefflera, is a tropical plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which helps it capture light in the shaded understory of its habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, attracting various wildlife. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in the wild."
