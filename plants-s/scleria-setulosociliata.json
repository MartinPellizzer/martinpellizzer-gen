    "intro": "Scleria setulosociliata, commonly known as the woolly bulbous sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted, grass-like foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scleria setulosociliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
