    "intro": "Sclarea lanata, commonly known as the woolly angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features a robust, branched stem covered in dense white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in compound umbels. Sclarea lanata is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its potential anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
