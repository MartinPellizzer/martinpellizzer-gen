    "intro": "Strophopappus regnellii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds for propagation. Strophopappus regnellii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
