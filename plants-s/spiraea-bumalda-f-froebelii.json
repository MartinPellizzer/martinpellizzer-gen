It features upright, slender stems that often droop, creating a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. Its foliage is typically dark green, becoming reddish in the fall. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
