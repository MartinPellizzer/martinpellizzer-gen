    "intro": "Senecio vernonioides, commonly known as the Vernon's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
