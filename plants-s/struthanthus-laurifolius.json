It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a drought-resistant structure. Struthanthus laurifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
