    "intro": "Stelis carnosula, commonly known as the fleshy-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
