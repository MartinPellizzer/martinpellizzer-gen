    "intro": "Stenochlaena henryi, commonly known as the Chinese fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizome is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
