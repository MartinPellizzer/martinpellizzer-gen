    "intro": "Schedonorus modestus, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Schedonorus modestus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
