    "intro": "Styphelia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. Styphelia obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal blooms."
