    "intro": "Schismus barbatus var. arabicus, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, adapted to store water in its hot, dry environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
