    "intro": "Selaginella mandaiana, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has distinctive, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged around the stem, and it produces small, cone-like structures called strobila for reproduction. Selaginella mandaiana is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive in conditions with limited light. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
