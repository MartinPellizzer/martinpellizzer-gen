    "intro": "Salvia multiramea, commonly known as the rock sage or mountain sage, is a perennial shrub native to the rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet to blue-purplish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia multiramea is also valued for its medicinal properties and historical use by indigenous communities."
