    "intro": "Salix isophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix isophylla is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in tundra and alpine environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects in its native range."
