    "intro": "Salix corsica, commonly known as the Corsican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Salix corsica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insect species."
