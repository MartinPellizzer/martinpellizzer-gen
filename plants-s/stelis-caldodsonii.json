It is a small epiphytic orchid, typically found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are delicate, with a fragrant, white to pale pink coloration and a distinctive, elongated lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
