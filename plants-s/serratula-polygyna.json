    "intro": "Serratula polygyna, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Serratula polygyna is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
