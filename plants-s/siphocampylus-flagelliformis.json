    "intro": "Siphocampylus flagelliformis, commonly known as the whip-like orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its long, slender stems that resemble a whip, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a raceme. Native to the cloud forests of Mexico, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
