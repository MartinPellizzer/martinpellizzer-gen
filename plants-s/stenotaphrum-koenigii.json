    "intro": "Stenotaphrum koenigii, commonly known as native grass or koenig grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland and riparian habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Stenotaphrum koenigii is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
