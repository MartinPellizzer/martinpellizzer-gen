    "intro": "Schizoglossum montanum, commonly known as the mountain schizoglossum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
