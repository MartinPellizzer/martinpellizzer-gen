    "intro": "Strobilanthes medogensis, commonly known as the \"Burmese flame flower,\" is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Myanmar. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
