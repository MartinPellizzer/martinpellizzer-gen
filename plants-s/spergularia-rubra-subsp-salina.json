It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high concentrations of salt in the soil. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. Its growth is often associated with sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline. Spergularia rubra subsp. salina plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
