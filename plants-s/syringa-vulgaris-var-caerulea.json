It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The common lilac is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
