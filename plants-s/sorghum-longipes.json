    "intro": "Sorghum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical inflorescence and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are typically arranged in a panicle structure. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Sorghum longipes is often used in traditional landscaping and as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
