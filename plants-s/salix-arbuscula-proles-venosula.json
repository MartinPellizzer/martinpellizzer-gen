    "intro": "Salix arbuscula proles venosula, commonly known as the veiny willow, is a shrub native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinct venation pattern that gives it its common name. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or wetlands. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical fruits that disperse seeds by wind."
