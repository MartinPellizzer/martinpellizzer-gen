    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 salviifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a drooping, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the autumn. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources."
