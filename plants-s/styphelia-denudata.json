    "intro": "Styphelia denudata, commonly known as the nakedleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Styphelia denudata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. It is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
