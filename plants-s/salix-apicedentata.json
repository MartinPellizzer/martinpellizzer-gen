    "intro": "Salix apicedentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats or wetlands. Salix apicedentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
