    "intro": "Salix lasiolepis, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray bark and soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
