    "intro": "Stelis ricaurtensis, commonly known as the Ricaut's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with elongated, thin stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its botanical features include specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stelis ricaurtensis is considered a vulnerable species."
