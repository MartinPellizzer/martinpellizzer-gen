    "intro": "Salvia costata, commonly known as the fringed sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping. The plant's common name refers to the fringed appearance of its flowers, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators."
