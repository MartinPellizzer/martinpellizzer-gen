    "intro": "Sagittaria gigantea, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features long, narrow leaves that are arrowhead-shaped, which help it float and absorb sunlight efficiently. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense colonies in wetlands and shallow waters. Sagittaria gigantea is valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic life."
