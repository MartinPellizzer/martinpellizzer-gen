    "intro": "Salix elongatula, commonly known as the elongated willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix elongatula is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in moist, rocky or sandy soils. Its growth habit and morphology make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
