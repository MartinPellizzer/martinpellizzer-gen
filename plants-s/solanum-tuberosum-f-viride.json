    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. viride, commonly known as the green potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its foliage, which retains a persistent green color throughout the growing season. The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and shares many traits with its parent species. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces small, yellow flowers typical of the genus Solanum. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its tuber yield."
