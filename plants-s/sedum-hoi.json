    "intro": "Sedum hoi, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Sedum hoi is typically found in regions with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
