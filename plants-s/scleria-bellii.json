It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Scleria bellii has slender, cylindrical stems with small, scale-like leaves, and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
