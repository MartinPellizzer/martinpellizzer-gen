    "intro": "Schefflera favargeri, commonly known as the Favargeri umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of leaves that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. The plant has glossy, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. Schefflera favargeri is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its air-purifying qualities."
