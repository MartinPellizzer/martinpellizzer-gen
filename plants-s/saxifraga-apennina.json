    "intro": "Saxifraga apennina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga apennina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh, high-altitude conditions."
