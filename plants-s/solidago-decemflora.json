    "intro": "Solidago decemflora, commonly known as the ten-flower goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous. Solidago decemflora plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the autumn season."
