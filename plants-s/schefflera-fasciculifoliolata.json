    "intro": "Schefflera fasciculifoliolata, commonly known as the clustered-leaf umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for bonsai and landscape design."
