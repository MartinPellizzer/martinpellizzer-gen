It is characterized by its flattened, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that often resemble orchids. This plant is native to Australia and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include a short, erect stem with a basal rosette of leaves and a single, slender inflorescence. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
