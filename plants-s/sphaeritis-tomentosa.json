    "intro": "Sphaeritis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sphaeritis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, grayish foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Sphaeritis tomentosa is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in its native habitat."
