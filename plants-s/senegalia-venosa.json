    "intro": "Senegalia venosa, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped pods and compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and attract various pollinators, including bees and birds. Senegalia venosa is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock."
