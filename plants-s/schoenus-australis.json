    "intro": "Schoenus australis, commonly known as the Australian flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Australia. It forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as swampy areas and along waterways. Schoenus australis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
