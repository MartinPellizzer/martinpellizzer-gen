    "intro": "Sparganium natans var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur-reed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, arranged in a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spiky, spherical fruits, which are a key feature of the genus Sparganium. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for aquatic life. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and stable wetland ecosystems."
