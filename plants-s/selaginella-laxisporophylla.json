    "intro": "Selaginella laxisporophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf spore-bearing clubmoss, is a species of spore-producing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has specialized structures called sporophylls that bear spores. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity. Selaginella laxisporophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
