    "intro": "Saxifraga aestivalis, commonly known as the summer saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features rosettes of dark green, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga aestivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded areas."
