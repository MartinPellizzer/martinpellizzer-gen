It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive deltoid-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and streamside areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
