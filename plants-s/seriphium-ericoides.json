    "intro": "Seriphium ericoides, commonly known as the heathleaf, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its leaves are densely packed, small, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
