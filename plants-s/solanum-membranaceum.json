    "intro": "Solanum membranaceum, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool and humid climates. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, with a distinctive membranous texture that gives it its scientific name. Solanum membranaceum is part of the nightshade family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
