    "intro": "Selliguea hastata, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a perennial fern native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Selliguea hastata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
