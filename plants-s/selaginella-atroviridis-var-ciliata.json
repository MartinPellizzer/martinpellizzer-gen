    "intro": "Selaginella atroviridis var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves with cilia along the margins, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic environments. Selaginella atroviridis var. ciliata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
