    "intro": "Sedum rendlei, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help it store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-resistant plants."
