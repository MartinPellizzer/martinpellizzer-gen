    "intro": "Syntherisma royleana, commonly known as the Kashmir rose, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky terrains. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. Syntherisma royleana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in its native habitat."
