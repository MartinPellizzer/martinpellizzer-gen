    "intro": "Sarcostemma crispum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its stems are characterized by their slender, wiry appearance and ability to twine around supports. Sarcostemma crispum is often found in rocky areas and along streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
