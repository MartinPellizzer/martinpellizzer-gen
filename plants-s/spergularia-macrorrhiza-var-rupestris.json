It is a low-growing perennial with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers during the summer months. It has a succulent habit, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats and coastal dunes."
