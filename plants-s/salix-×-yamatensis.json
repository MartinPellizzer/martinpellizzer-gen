It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in moist environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
