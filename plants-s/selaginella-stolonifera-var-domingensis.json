    "intro": "Selaginella stolonifera var. domingensis, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to Central America. It features small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered around short, horizontal stems called stolons. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
