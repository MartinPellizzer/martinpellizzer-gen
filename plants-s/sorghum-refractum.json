    "intro": "Sorghum refractum, commonly known as the refractum sorghum, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a tall, robust grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a hardy crop in regions with limited water. Its seeds are typically used for food, animal feed, or as a source of biofuel. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other sorghum species."
