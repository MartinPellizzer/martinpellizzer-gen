    "intro": "Spergella macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent. Spergella macrocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microscopic prey and contributing to nutrient cycling."
