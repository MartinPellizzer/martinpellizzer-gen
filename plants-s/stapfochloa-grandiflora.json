    "intro": "Stapfochloa grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, inflorescences with pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
