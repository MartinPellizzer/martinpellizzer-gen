    "intro": "Stachygynandrum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine grass vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its low-growing habit. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Stachygynandrum alpinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude environments."
