    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos hastatopinnatus, commonly known as the hairy-leafed star-fruit, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, star-shaped fruits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological study. Due to its limited distribution, it is often found in specific microhabitats within tropical and subtropical regions."
