    "intro": "Silene ciliata subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks, and it has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
