    "intro": "Salsola iliensis, commonly known as the Ili saltbush, is a shrub native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions like Kazakhstan and China. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline and arid environments, often growing in desert or semi-desert areas. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water, and its flowers are typically greenish-white, appearing in clusters. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals. Salsola iliensis is an important component of the flora in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity in extreme climates."
