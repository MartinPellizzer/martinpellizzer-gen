    "intro": "Stenogyne kamehamehae var. albiflora, commonly known as the Kamehameha's white-flowered honeysuckle, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as within the canopy of native forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
