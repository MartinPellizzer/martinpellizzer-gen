    "intro": "Sarcotheca rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined sarcococca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sarcococceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. These flowers are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for certain bird species. Native to eastern Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
