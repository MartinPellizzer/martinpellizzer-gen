    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum decagynum, commonly known as the sunless-fruit tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, spirally arranged leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are predominantly white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Sciodaphyllum decagynum is considered a conservation priority."
