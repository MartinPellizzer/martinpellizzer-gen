    "intro": "Stipa lejophylla, commonly known as the lowleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its foliage is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and drought tolerance. Stipa lejophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local wildlife."
