    "intro": "Selaginella distorta, commonly known as the twisted spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it its common name. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Selaginella distorta is well adapted to drought conditions, with a specialized root system that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments."
