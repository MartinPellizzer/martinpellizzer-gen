    "intro": "Sopubia karaguensis, commonly known as the Karag\u00f6z lichen, is a rare and unique lichen species found in specific regions of Turkey. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure and chemical composition. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in rocky and shaded environments. Its morphology includes a crustose growth form with a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Sopubia karaguensis is of interest to mycologists and conservationists."
