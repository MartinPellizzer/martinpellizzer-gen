    "intro": "Sophronitis gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Sophronitis gracilis is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
