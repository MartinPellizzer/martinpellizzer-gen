    "intro": "Salix holosericea var. nitens, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in willow species. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. The species is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
