    "intro": "Scortechinia nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees, typically in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the monsoon season. Its unique botanical features include specialized roots for nutrient absorption and a complex flowering structure typical of orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
