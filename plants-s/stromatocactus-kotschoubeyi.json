    "intro": "Stromatocactus kotschoubeyi, commonly known as the \"Candelabra Cactus,\" is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that branches into multiple cylindrical stems, resembling a candelabra. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Stromatocactus kotschoubeyi is also noted for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
