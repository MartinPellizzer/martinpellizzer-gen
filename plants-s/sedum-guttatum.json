    "intro": "Sedum guttatum, commonly known as the \"Guttate stonecrop,\" is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that often bear translucent, water-filled glands. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum guttatum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
