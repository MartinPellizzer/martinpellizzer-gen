    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sibyllina, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow that exhibits striking botanical features. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that drape gracefully, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a silvery-white underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in male and female spikes. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along waterways."
