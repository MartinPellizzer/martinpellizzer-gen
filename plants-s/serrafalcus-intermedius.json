    "intro": "Serrafalcus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate serrated fern, is a species of fern characterized by its complex and finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with serrated margins that give it its common name. Serrafalcus intermedius thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests."
