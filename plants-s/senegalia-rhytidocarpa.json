    "intro": "Senegalia rhytidocarpa, commonly known as the African whitethorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, papery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by bean-like pods containing seeds. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to dry climates. Senegalia rhytidocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native environment."
