    "intro": "Sida amoena, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Sida amoena is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, and it can become invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
