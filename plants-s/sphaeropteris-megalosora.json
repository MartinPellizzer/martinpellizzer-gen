It is characterized by its large, sturdy trunk and a crown of fronds that can reach impressive lengths. The plant has a distinctive, swollen base that resembles a bulb, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that adds to its ornamental value. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
