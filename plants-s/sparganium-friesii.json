    "intro": "Sparganium friesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr rush, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, spiky, spore-bearing structures called strobili. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and the edges of ponds. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Sparganium friesii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve water quality."
