    "intro": "Scleranthopsis aphanantha, commonly known as the ghost thorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual with slender, pale green stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique, spirally arranged leaves that give it a ghost-like appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
