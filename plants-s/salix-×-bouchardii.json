    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 bouchardii, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near waterways, making it a common ornamental in wetland areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically valuable and aesthetically pleasing in landscaping."
