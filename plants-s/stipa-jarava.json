It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa jarava plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
