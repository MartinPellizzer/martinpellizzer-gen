It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated, seed-containing pods. Its leaves and roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitats."
