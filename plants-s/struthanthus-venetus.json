    "intro": "Struthanthus venetus, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Struthanthus venetus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
