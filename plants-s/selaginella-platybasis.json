    "intro": "Selaginella platybasis, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with upright, spirally arranged stems and small, scale-like leaves. Selaginella platybasis produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are located at the tips of the stems. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its unique adaptations to humid, tropical climates."
