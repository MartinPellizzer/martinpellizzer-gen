    "intro": "Salix lavendulifolia var. fragifera, commonly known as the fragrant willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its fragrant foliage and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden cultivation. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
