    "intro": "Stipa leptophylla, commonly known as slender leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense tussocks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Stipa leptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
