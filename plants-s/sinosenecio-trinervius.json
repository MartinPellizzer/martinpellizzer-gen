It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, and has finely divided, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypselae. Sinosenecio trinervius is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
