    "intro": "Saccolabium intermedium, commonly known as the Texas milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Saccolabium intermedium is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh, dry climates."
