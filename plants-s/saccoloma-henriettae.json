    "intro": "Saccoloma henriettae, commonly known as the Henrietta's saccoloma, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a serrated margin. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Saccoloma henriettae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
