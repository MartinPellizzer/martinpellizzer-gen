    "intro": "Stichorkis insectifera, commonly known as the insect-bearing stichorkis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant's unique name suggests a possible association with insects, though the exact nature of this relationship remains under study."
