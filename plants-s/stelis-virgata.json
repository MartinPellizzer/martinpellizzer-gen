    "intro": "Stelis virgata, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
