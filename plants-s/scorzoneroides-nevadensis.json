    "intro": "Scorzoneroides nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada scorzoneroides, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the high-altitude environment of its native habitat. It is often found in open meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
