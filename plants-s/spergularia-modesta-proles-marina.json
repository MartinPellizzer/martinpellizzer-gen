    "intro": "Spergularia modesta proles marina, commonly known as the sea sandspurry, is a low-growing flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to salty, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and tidal zones. It has a prostrate growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground and stabilize sand dunes. This species plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
