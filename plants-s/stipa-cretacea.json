    "intro": "Stipa cretacea, commonly known as the Crete needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Stipa cretacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
