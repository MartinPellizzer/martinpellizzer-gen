    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei f. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit. It features fuzzy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Native to rocky and alpine environments, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its hirsute foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
