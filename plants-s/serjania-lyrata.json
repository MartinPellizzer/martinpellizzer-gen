    "intro": "Serjania lyrata, commonly known as the lyrewood or lyre tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Serjania lyrata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural and ecological studies."
