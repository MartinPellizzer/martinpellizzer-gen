    "intro": "Senecio lubumbashianus, commonly known as the Lubumbashi groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
