    "intro": "Streptoloma sumbarense, commonly known as the Sumbawan starwort, is a rare and delicate plant native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a dense umbel, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
