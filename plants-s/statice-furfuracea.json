    "intro": "Statice furfuracea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its showy, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss. Statice furfuracea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate harsh, maritime conditions."
