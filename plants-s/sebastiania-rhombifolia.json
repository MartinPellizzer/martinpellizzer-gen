It is characterized by its opposite, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
