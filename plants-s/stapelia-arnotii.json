    "intro": "Stapelia arnotii, commonly known as the \"Corpse Flower of the Cape,\" is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are often described as resembling decaying flesh, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection. Stapelia arnotii is prized in horticulture for its unusual appearance and ability to bloom reliably under proper care."
