    "intro": "Salvia thyrsiflora, commonly known as the thrysoflora sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia thyrsiflora is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ornamental appeal in gardens."
