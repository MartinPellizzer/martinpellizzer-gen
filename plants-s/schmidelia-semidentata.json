    "intro": "Schmidelia semidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved schmidelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
