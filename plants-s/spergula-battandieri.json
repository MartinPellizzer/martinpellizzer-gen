    "intro": "Spergula battandieri, commonly known as the Italian wheatgrass, is a low-growing annual grass species native to southern Europe. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Spergula battandieri is valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
