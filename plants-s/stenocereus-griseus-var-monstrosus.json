    "intro": "Stenocereus griseus var. monstrosus, commonly known as the \"Monstrose Hedgehog Cactus,\" is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its swollen, rib-like stems that form a dense, spiny structure resembling a hedgehog. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
