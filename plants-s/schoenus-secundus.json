    "intro": "Schoenus secundus, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Schoenus secundus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
