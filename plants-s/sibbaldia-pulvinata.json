    "intro": "Sibbaldia pulvinata, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss. Sibbaldia pulvinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
