    "intro": "Saxifraga longifolia subsp. gaussenii, commonly known as the long-flowered saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface, and the subspecies is distinguished by its longer floral stems compared to the typical form. Saxifraga longifolia subsp. gaussenii is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to withstand cold and harsh climatic conditions."
