    "intro": "Scleria terrestris, commonly known as the ground sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or brown in color. Scleria terrestris is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
