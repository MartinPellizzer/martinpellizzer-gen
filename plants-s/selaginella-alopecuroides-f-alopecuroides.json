    "intro": "Selaginella alopecuroides f. alopecuroides, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls along its stems, which are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This species is notable for its ability to survive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to environmental stress."
