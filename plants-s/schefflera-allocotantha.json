    "intro": "Schefflera allocotantha, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded crown with small, glossy, dark green leaves arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and attractive appearance make it suitable for bonsai cultivation and small spaces."
