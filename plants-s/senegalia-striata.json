    "intro": "Senegalia striata, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soils in desert environments. Senegalia striata is also valued for its hardiness and use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
