    "intro": "Salix pseudopurpurea, commonly known as the purple willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically tinged with purple on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are primarily pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Salix pseudopurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
