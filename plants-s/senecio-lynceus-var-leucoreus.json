    "intro": "Senecio lynceus var. leucoreus, commonly known as the white lion's ear, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It features large, velvety, silver-white to pale blue leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble the ears of a lion. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
