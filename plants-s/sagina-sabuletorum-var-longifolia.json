    "intro": "Sagina sabuletorum var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal and sandy habitats. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, borne in dense clusters at the leaf axils, and are pollinated by insects. This variety is distinguished by its longer leaves compared to other varieties of Sagina sabuletorum. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, beaches, and disturbed sandy areas."
