It is an annual herb with erect, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, adapted to the arid environment. Scleranthus schimperi is typically found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in semi-arid regions."
