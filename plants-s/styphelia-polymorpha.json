    "intro": "Styphelia polymorpha, commonly known as the variable wintergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Styphelia polymorpha is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its foliage is evergreen, with leathery leaves that help it survive in harsh coastal conditions."
