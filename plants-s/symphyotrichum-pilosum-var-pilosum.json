It is characterized by its upright stems and showy, purple-pink flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in a conical shape at the top of the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, white hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and prairies."
