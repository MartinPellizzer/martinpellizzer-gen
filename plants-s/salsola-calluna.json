    "intro": "Salsola calluna, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Salsola calluna is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds, making it an invasive species in some regions."
