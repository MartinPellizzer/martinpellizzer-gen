    "intro": "Stellaria linoides, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a silvery-white underside that gives the plant its common name. Small white flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
