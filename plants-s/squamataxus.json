    "intro": "Squamataxus, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
