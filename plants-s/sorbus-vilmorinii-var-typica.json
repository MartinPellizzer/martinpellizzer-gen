    "intro": "Sorbus vilmorinii var. typica, commonly known as the Vilmorin's whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats."
