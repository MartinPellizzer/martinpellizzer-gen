    "intro": "Saussurea bartholomewii, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, yellow to orange composite flower heads. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan medicine."
