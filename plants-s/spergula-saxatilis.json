    "intro": "Spergula saxatilis, commonly known as the saxifrage grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe. It typically forms dense mats and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating salt spray and poor soil conditions. Spergula saxatilis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
