    "intro": "Schmaltzia cissodes, commonly known as the common schmaltzia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the summer months. Schmaltzia cissodes is a low-growing perennial, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
