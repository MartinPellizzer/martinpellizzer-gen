    "intro": "Salvia sonomensis, commonly known as Sonoran sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet to blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Salvia sonomensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
