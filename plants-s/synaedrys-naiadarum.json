    "intro": "Synaedrys naiadarum, commonly known as the Moonshade Lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft glow at night, a feature unique to its genus. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Synaedrys naiadarum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves."
