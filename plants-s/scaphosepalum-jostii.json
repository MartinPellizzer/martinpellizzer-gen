    "intro": "Scaphosepalum jostii, commonly known as the Jost's scaphosepalum, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family, which is one of the largest families of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically feature a unique lip or labellum, a key feature in orchid morphology. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Scaphosepalum jostii is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories."
