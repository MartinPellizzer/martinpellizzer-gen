    "intro": "Succisa incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its long-lasting, fluffy flowers that remain intact for extended periods, making it popular in floral arrangements. Succisa incisa typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, adapting well to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery or grayish coating that helps reduce water loss."
