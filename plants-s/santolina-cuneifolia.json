    "intro": "Santolina cuneifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, silver-gray foliage with a distinctive linear shape, which gives it a refined appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina cuneifolia is valued for its aromatic leaves and low maintenance requirements."
