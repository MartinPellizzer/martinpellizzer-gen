    "intro": "Stapelia tigrina, commonly known as the tiger tail plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that resemble the tail of a tiger, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red markings, resembling the face of a lion. These flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated by insects such as beetles and flies. Stapelia tigrina is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
