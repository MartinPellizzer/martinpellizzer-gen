    "intro": "Sida setosa, commonly known as seaside cotton or sea holly, is an annual herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, cotton-like seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Sida setosa is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including high winds and salt spray."
