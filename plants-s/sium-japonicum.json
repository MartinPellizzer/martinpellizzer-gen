    "intro": "Sium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese water dropwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near streams or in flooded areas. The plant features hollow, cylindrical stems and broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. The plant is valued for its edible roots, which have a slightly bitter taste and are used in traditional Asian cuisine."
