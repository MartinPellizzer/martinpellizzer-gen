    "intro": "Solidago virginiana, commonly known as the Canadian goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to dry soils in woodland areas, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in panicles. Solidago virginiana plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
