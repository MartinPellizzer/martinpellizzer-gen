    "intro": "Sceptridium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, linear fronds that are often less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Sceptridium tenuifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
