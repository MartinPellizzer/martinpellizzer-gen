    "intro": "Silene inflata subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the common bladder campion, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive inflated, bladder-like seed pods. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The species is widespread across Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
