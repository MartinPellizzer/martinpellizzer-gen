    "intro": "Saxifraga chamaepityfolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense mats close to the ground. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer. Saxifraga chamaepityfolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes."
