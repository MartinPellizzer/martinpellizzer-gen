    "intro": "Salix shiraii var. kenoensis, commonly known as the Kenoensis willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
