    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. salicifolia, commonly known as the whitebeam or white-ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated, elongated leaves that resemble those of willow, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture. This species is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
