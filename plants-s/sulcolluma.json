    "intro": "Sulcolluma, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. Its small, star-shaped flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
