    "intro": "Stephanodaphne, commonly known as the \"star-leaf\" or \"star-leaf fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plants typically have compound leaves with a pinnate structure, and the leaves often exhibit a striking, ornamental appearance. Stephanodaphne species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
