    "intro": "Satureja chinensis var. parviflora, commonly known as Chinese thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and culinary applications. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The essential oils derived from its leaves contain compounds such as thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
