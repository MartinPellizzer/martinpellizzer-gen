    "intro": "Skimmia oblata var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow margins, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its slow growth and ability to tolerate acidic soil conditions."
