    "intro": "Selaginella pinfaenensis, commonly known as the pinfaenensis spikemoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature common among spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary adaptations in early land plants."
