    "intro": "Salpichroa quitensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold, high-altitude environment. Salpichroa quitensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine by local communities."
