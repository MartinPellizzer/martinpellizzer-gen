    "intro": "Stipa acrociliata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, pale green to brownish flowers. It is adapted to rocky and arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
