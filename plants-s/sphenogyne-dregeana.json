    "intro": "Sphenogyne dregeana, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant features a thick, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are tubular and have a unique, lantern-like shape, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Sphenogyne dregeana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
