    "intro": "Saxifraga lamottei var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Saxifragaceae family."
