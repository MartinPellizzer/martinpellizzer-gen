    "intro": "Serratula arborescens, commonly known as the tree yarrow, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, branching structure and gray-green, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Serratula arborescens is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. However, it contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which can be toxic to livestock and humans if ingested in large quantities."
