    "intro": "Swertia lovenii, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.
