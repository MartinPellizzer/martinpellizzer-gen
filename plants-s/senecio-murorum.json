    "intro": "Senecio murorum, commonly known as the wall senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a head-like cluster, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio murorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
