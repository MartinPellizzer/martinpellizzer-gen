    "intro": "Styphelia apiculata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 30 centimeters, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Styphelia apiculata thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heath environments. It is a hardy plant that is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
