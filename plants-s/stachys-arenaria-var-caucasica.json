    "intro": "Stachys arenaria var. caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
