It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. The botanical features of Sonchus \u00d7 novocastellanus make it both a common weed and a subject of study in ecological and agricultural contexts."
