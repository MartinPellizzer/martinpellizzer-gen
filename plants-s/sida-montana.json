    "intro": "Sida montana, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Sida montana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
