    "intro": "Scirpus rigescens, commonly known as the stiff sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are grass-like with a prominent midrib. Scirpus rigescens produces small, greenish-brown spikes of flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
