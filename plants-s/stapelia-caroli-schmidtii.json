    "intro": "Stapelia caroli-schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often ribbed stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, resembling the appearance of a corpse, hence its common name \"Corpse Flower.\" It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. The plant is also noted for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, which helps it survive in dry climates."
