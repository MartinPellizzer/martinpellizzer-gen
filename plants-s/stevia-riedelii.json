It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are found in the leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Stevia riedelii is often cultivated as a natural sweetener and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
