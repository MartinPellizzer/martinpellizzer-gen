    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating shadow fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, undulating fronds that give it a distinctive, wave-like appearance. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum undulatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
