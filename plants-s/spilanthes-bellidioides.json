    "intro": "Spilanthes bellidioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false mustard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are not as well-studied as those of other members of its family."
