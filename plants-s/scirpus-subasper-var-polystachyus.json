    "intro": "Scirpus subasper var. polystachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The flowering structure is adapted for wind pollination, typical of many Cyperaceae family members."
