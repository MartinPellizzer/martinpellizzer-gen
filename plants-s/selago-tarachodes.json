    "intro": "Selago tarachodes, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Selago tarachodes plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is an important part of the coastal flora in its native range."
