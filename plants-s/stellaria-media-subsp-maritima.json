    "intro": "Stellaria media subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces tiny, white star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to salty, sandy soils and can tolerate frequent exposure to sea spray. It is often found in dune ecosystems and other coastal habitats. Its succulent leaves and specialized root system help it retain moisture in harsh, arid environments."
