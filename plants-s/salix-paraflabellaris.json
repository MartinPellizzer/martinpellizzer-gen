    "intro": "Salix paraflabellaris, commonly known as the Paraflabellar willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Salix paraflabellaris thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
