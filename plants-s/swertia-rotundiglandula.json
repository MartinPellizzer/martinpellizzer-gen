It belongs to the gentian family (Gentianaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have rounded glands, giving it its specific epithet \"rotundiglandula.\" Swertia rotundiglandula is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
