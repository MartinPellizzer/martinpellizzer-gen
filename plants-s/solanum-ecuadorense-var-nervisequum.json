    "intro": "Solanum ecuadorense var. nervisequum, commonly known as the Ecuadorian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, oval-shaped leaves with a distinct veining pattern, and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. It produces purple to black berries that are typically toxic to humans but may be used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
