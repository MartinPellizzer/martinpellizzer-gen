    "intro": "Solanum novemlobum, commonly known as the nine-lobed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive nine-lobed leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or red when mature, and they contain toxic compounds similar to other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
