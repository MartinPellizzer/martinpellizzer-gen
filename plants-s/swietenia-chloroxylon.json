    "intro": "Swietenia chloroxylon, commonly known as the white sand cedar, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
