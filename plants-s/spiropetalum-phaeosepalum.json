    "intro": "Spiropetalum phaeosepalum, commonly known as the dark-sepal spiraling orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence and dark, velvety sepals that give it its common name. Its flowers are typically small and come in shades of purple and violet, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
