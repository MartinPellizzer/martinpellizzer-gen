    "intro": "Silene acaulis proles bryoides, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, mat-like growths that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to rocky landscapes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against frost. This species is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
