    "intro": "Salix macounii, commonly known as Macoun's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown beneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian areas, stream banks, and wetlands, contributing to erosion control and providing habitat for wildlife. Salix macounii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native environment."
