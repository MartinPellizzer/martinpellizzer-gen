    "intro": "Saxifraga atlantica subsp. carpetana, commonly known as the Atlantic saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. The plant typically grows in low, dense mats, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. It is often found on cliffs, sea walls, and other exposed coastal habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for harsh maritime conditions."
