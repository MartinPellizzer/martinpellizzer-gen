    "intro": "Solanum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and sparsely hairy foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum rigidum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
