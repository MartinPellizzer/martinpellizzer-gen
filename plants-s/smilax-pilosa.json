    "intro": "Smilax pilosa, commonly known as the rough smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and attach to supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Smilax pilosa is often found in moist woodlands and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade."
