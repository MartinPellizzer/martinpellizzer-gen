    "intro": "Syncolostemon parviflorus var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved synclast, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
