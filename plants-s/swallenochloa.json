    "intro": "Swallenochloa, commonly known as the golden grass or swamp grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, often hairy leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. Swallenochloa species are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. These plants play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
