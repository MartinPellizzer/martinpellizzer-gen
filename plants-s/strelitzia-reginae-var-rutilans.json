It is characterized by its vibrant, banana-like leaves that are dark green with a smooth texture. The plant produces showy, bird-of-paradise-like flowers in shades of orange and yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
