It features fleshy, obovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in dense rosettes. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum obovatum is drought-tolerant and low-maintenance, making it an ideal choice for gardeners looking for hardy, ornamental plants."
