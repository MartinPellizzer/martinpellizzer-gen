    "intro": "Syringodea filamentosa, commonly known as the thread-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Syringodea filamentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
