    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. multicaulis, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with numerous short, upright stems. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia."
