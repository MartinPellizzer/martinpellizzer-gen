    "intro": "Stapelia canescens, commonly known as the woolly Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems to survive droughts. Stapelia canescens is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
