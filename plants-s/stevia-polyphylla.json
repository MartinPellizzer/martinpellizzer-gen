    "intro": "Stevia polyphylla, commonly known as the Andean stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in various food products. Stevia polyphylla is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its medicinal and culinary applications."
