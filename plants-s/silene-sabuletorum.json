    "intro": "Silene sabuletorum, commonly known as the sand bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Silene sabuletorum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
