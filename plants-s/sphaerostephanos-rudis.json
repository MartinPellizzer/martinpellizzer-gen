    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos rudis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in coastal environments, often growing on rocky shores and sandy beaches. The plant is characterized by its spherical, spiky flower heads that resemble small, colorful balls, typically in shades of blue, purple, and white. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline, coastal habitat. Sphaerostephanos rudis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
