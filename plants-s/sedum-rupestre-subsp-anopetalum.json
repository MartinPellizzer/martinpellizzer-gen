    "intro": "Sedum rupestre subsp. anopetalum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, adapted to store water and withstand harsh conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it an excellent choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy and decorative addition to dry landscapes."
