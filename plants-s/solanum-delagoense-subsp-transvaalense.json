    "intro": "Solanum delagoense subsp. transvaalense, commonly known as the Transvaal nightshade, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not suitable for human consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
