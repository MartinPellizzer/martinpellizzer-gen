    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. longiloba, commonly known as the longleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that often root in shallow water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the waterline. Its leaves are usually longer than those of the typical Sagittaria sagittifolia, giving it its distinguishing feature. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability."
