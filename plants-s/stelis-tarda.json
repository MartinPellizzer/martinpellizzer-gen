    "intro": "Stelis tarda, commonly known as the late blooming orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Stelis tarda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
