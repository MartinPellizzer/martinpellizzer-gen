    "intro": "Sophora jaubertii, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of violet or white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
