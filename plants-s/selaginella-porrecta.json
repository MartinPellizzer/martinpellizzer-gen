    "intro": "Selaginella porrecta, commonly known as the thread moss or slender clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Selaginella porrecta reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. This plant is also notable for its role in the study of plant evolution due to its ancient lineage and morphological features."
