    "intro": "Sida obtusa, commonly known as woolly sida, is an annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. Sida obtusa is also known for its use in traditional medicine."
