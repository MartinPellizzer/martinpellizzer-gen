    "intro": "Stemonurus impressus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense, overlapping fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
