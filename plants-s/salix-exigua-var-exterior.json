It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the early spring. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water sources. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
