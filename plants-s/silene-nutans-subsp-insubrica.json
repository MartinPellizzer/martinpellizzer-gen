    "intro": "Silene nutans subsp. insubrica, commonly known as the nodding catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Silene nutans."
