    "intro": "Stachyarrhena duckei, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern and northern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas exposed to salt spray. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stachyarrhena duckei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in coastal environments."
