    "intro": "Scutellaria galericulata f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy purple skullcap, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of violet to purple flowers. Its botanical name reflects its distinct pubescence, or hairy texture, and its resemblance to the common skullcap species. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, well-drained soils."
