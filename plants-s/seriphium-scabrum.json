    "intro": "Seriphium scabrum, commonly known as rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow, rough, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Seriphium scabrum produces yellow to orange composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
