    "intro": "Selaginella miniatospora, commonly known as the dwarf spore moss, is a small, terrestrial plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This species is notable for its ability to survive in arid environments, showcasing remarkable desiccation tolerance. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. Its reproductive system and morphological traits make it an interesting subject for studies in plant physiology and evolution."
