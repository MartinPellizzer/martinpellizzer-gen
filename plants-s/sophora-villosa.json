    "intro": "Sophora villosa, commonly known as the silky sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by long, bean-like pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The species is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
