    "intro": "Saponaria porrigens, commonly known as the clustered soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, pink or red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, soapy residue, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its historical use in soap-making and as a medicinal plant adds to its botanical significance."
