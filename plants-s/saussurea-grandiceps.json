    "intro": "Saussurea grandiceps, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saussurea grandiceps is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
