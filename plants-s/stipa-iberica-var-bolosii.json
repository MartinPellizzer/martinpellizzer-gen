    "intro": "Stipa iberica var. bolosii, commonly known as the Iberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or arid environments."
