    "intro": "Silene ordossica, commonly known as the Ordos sandcrane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of northern China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, sandy environments, with deep roots that help it survive in low-water conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Silene ordossica plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is of interest for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
