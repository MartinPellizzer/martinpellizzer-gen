    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. subrotundus, commonly known as the broadleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are typically light to dark green in color. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. This species is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
