    "intro": "Schizaea serrata, commonly known as the serrated mossy fern, is a member of the family Schizaeaceae. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping rhizomes and erect, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaves. Schizaea serrata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
