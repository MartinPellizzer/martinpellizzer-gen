    "intro": "Salix pyrina, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin layers. Salix pyrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
