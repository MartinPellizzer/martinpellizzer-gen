It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers and woody stems. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Its roots and leaves are also utilized in local remedies for their medicinal properties. However, due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat."
