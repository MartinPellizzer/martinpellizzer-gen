    "intro": "Spergula rubra subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed red sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil. Its subspecies is distinguished by its longer inflorescences compared to other forms of Spergula rubra. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
