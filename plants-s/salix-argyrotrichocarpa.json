    "intro": "Salix argyrotrichocarpa, commonly known as the silver-haired willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silvery-white pubescence on the young shoots and leaves. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments."
