    "intro": "Salix trichocarpa, commonly known as black cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, and it plays an important role in riparian ecosystems. The wood of Salix trichocarpa is soft and lightweight, making it valuable for paper production and other industrial uses."
