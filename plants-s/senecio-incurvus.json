    "intro": "Senecio incurvus, commonly known as the curly dock, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of waxy, blue-green leaves that curl inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Senecio incurvus is a perennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
