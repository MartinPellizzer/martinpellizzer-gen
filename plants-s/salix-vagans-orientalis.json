    "intro": "Salix vagans orientalis, commonly known as the oriental weeping willow, is a species of willow native to parts of Asia, including China and Russia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and they appear in early spring."
