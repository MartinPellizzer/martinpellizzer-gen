    "intro": "Symphyotrichum lanceolatum, commonly known as the New England aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to dry prairies, woodlands, and open areas, and it thrives in full sun. Its lance-shaped leaves are usually alternate and have a rough texture, while its stems are often hairy. The New England aster is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
