    "intro": "Sphaeralcea violacea, commonly known as the violet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea violacea is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
