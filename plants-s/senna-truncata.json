It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, twisted pods that split open to release the seeds. Senna truncata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
