    "intro": "Saussurea angustifolia var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky saussurea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered with a sticky substance. The plant produces yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying high-altitude flora."
