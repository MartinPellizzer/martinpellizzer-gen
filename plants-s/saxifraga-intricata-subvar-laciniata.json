    "intro": "Saxifraga intricata subvar. laciniata, commonly known as the finely toothed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The leaves are typically basal, with a distinctive lobed or toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This plant is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and aesthetic value."
