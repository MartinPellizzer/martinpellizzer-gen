    "intro": "Salvia perplicata, commonly known as the Mexican bush sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy to the touch, providing a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Salvia perplicata is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
