    "intro": "Saurauia cerea, commonly known as the white saurauia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Saurauia cerea is often used in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
