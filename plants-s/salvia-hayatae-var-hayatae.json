    "intro": "Salvia hayatae var. hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's sage, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flower clusters and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowering period typically occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
