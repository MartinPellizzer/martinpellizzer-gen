It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth-edged. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
