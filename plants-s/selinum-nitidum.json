    "intro": "Selinum nitidum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Selinum nitidum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical applications are not as well-documented as those of other members of its family."
