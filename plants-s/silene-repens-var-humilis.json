    "intro": "Silene repens var. humilis, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
