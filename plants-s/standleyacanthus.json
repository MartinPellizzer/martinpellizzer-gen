    "intro": "Standleyacanthus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Standleyacanthus species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
