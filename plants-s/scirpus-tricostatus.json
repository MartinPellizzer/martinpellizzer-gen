    "intro": "Scirpus tricostatus, commonly known as the three-costed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of many Cyperaceae species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct ribbing pattern that gives it its common name. Scirpus tricostatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
