    "intro": "Saprosma mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf mahogany, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
