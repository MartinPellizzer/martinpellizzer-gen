    "intro": "Scilla hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of striking blue or purple flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often overlooked beneath the flowering stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
