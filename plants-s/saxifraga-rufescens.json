    "intro": "Saxifraga rufescens, commonly known as the red sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically features dense clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Saxifraga rufescens is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is a common indicator species in high-altitude ecosystems."
