    "intro": "Salix tomentosa var. macrostachia, commonly known as the woolly willow or broad-stalked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves and catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it can grow up to 5 meters in height. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
