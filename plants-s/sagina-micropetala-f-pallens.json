    "intro": "Sagina micropetala f. pallens, commonly known as silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
