    "intro": "Stelis tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors. The plant has a slender, upright stem with three distinct color bands on its flowers, which are usually white, yellow, and purple. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces tiny, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Stelis tricolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
