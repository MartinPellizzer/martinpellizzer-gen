    "intro": "Sphallerocarpus gracilis, commonly known as the slender sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The tree is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, woolly capsules that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Sphallerocarpus gracilis typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests."
