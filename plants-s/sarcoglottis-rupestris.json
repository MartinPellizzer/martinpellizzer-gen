    "intro": "Sarcoglottis rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, often branched stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil."
