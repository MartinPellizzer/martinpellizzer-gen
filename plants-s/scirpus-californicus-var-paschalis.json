    "intro": "Scirpus californicus var. paschalis, commonly known as the California bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering spikes that rise on slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. This variety is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
