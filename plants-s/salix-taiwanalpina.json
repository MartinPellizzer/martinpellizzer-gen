    "intro": "Salix taiwanalpina, commonly known as the Taiwan alpine willow, is a deciduous shrub native to high-altitude regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
