    "intro": "Salix flavescens, commonly known as yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, riparian habitats and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are usually yellow-green in color, and the plant produces catkins in early spring. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize stream banks and prevent erosion. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its adaptability to wetland environments."
