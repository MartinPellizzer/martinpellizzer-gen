The plant produces numerous small, bright yellow flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Solidago reflexa thrives in moist soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks."
