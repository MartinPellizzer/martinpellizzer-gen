    "intro": "Soulangia epacridifolia, commonly known as the silver-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that have a silvery sheen due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
