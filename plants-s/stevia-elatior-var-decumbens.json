    "intro": "[WRONG START] S-tevia elatior var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping stevia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, sweet taste due to the presence of steviol glycosides. It is often used as a natural sweetener and in herbal remedies."
