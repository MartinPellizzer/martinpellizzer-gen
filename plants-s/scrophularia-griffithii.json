    "intro": "Scrophularia griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features upright stems that are usually covered with short, stiff hairs. Its flowers are arranged in clusters and are typically pink or purple, with two lips that are characteristic of the Scrophulariaceae family. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its adaptability to harsh climates."
