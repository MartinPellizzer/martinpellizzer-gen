    "intro": "Sarcochilus falcatus, commonly known as the sickle orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a creeping rhizome and a rosette of narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that bears a raceme of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive white lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The orchid is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is a popular choice for cultivation in cool, humid conditions."
