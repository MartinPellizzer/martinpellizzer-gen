It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
