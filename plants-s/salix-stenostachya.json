    "intro": "Salix stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-staminal willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in willow species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
