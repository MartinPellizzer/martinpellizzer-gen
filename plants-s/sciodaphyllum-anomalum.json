    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum anomalum, commonly known as the ghost pine, is a rare and enigmatic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of ghostly, translucent structures. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and has a distinctive, twisted trunk that often appears stunted or gnarled. Its cones are small and often obscured by the dense foliage, making them difficult to detect. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciodaphyllum anomalum is considered a critically endangered species."
