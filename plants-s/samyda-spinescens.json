    "intro": "Samyda spinescens, commonly known as the spiny samyda, is a shrub native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Samyda spinescens is often found in rocky or arid habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
