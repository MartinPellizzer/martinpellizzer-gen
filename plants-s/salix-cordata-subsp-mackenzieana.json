It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
