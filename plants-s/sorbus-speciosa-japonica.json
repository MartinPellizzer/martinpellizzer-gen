    "intro": "Sorbus speciosa japonica, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal changes in color."
