    "intro": "Synaedrys lepidocarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded synaedrys, is a shrub native to the southern regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of minute hairs. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
