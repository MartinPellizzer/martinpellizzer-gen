    "intro": "Styphelia madida subsp. hirtigera, commonly known as the Hirtigera heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
