    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. impunctata, commonly known as the smooth saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in crevices and on rocky slopes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
