    "intro": "Schefflera stenoura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Schefflera stenoura thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
