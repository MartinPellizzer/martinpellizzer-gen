    "intro": "Schismus calycinus var. tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Schismus calycinus var. tenuis is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats."
