    "intro": "Salix cardiophylla var. urbaniana, commonly known as the urban willow, is a rare variant of the willow tree native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies, showcasing its preference for wetland environments. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
