    "intro": "Salix rorismarinifolia, commonly known as the sea willow, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. Its root system is highly adaptable, allowing it to thrive in sandy or saline soils near the shoreline. Salix rorismarinifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
