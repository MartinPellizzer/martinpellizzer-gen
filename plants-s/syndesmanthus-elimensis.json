    "intro": "Syndesmanthus elimensis, commonly known as the African silver tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-resistant and suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local communities."
