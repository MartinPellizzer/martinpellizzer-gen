    "intro": "Salix reticulata f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf weeping willow, is a cultivar of the willow tree characterized by its distinctive weeping habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant, cascading branches. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Its leaves are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. The flowers are small, catkin-like structures that appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
