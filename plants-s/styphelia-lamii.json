    "intro": "Styphelia lamii, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Styphelia lamii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
