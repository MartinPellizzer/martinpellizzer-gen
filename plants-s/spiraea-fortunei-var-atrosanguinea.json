    "intro": "Spiraea fortunei var. atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black-tainted weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces dark red to black berries in the fall, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its foliage turns a striking reddish-purple in the autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
