It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and savanna habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, yellow-green stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.
