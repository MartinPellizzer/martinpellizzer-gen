    "intro": "Sphaeralcea rivularis, commonly known as the riverbank globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows along stream banks and moist soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive globular shape, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea rivularis is adapted to riparian habitats and plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks through its extensive root system."
