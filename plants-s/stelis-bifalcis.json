    "intro": "Stelis bifalcis, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Stelis bifalcis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
