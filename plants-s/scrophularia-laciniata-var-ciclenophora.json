It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and support of pollinators."
