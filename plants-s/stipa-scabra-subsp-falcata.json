    "intro": "Stipa scabra subsp. falcata, commonly known as the scabrous grass or falcate feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is usually erect and slightly drooping, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage and floral structure make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of grassland ecosystems."
