    "intro": "Setaria viridis f. arenosa, commonly known as sandflat barnyardgrass, is a variant of the common green foxtail. It is a grass species native to Africa and is characterized by its adaptation to sandy or disturbed soils. The plant typically grows in open habitats and is often found in agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This form is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
