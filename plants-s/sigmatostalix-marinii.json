    "intro": "Sigmatostalix marinii, commonly known as the coastal broom, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Sigmatostalix marinii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
