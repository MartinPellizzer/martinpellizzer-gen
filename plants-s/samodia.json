    "intro": "Samodia, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and the flowers bloom in early spring, producing a striking blue hue. Samodia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
