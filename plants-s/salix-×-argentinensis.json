It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. It is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is also cultivated in gardens and parks."
