    "intro": "Salvia grandis, commonly known as the giant sage, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, making it a prominent feature in gardens. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its lance-shaped leaves are gray-green and have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Salvia grandis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
