    "intro": "Salix attenuata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streams and wetlands. Salix attenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas. It is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
