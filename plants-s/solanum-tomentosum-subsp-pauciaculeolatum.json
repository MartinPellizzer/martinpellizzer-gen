    "intro": "Solanum tomentosum subsp. pauciaculeolatum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
