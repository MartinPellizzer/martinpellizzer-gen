    "intro": "Scirpus coronatus, commonly known as the crowned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow-green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Scirpus coronatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
