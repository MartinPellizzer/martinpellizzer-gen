    "intro": "Sida micropetala, commonly known as small-petioled sida, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. Sida micropetala is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
