    "intro": "Santaloidella gilletii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalales order. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in nutrient-poor soils, relying on mycorrhizal associations for essential nutrients. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its woody structure allows it to persist in harsh environments, and it is often found in association with other parasitic and non-parasitic plants. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
