    "intro": "Serapias cordigera subsp. azorica, commonly known as the Azorean sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Azores. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and coastal areas. It is adapted to the mild, moist climate of the Azores and exhibits specialized features for survival in its unique environment. The subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
