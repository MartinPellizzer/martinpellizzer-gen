    "intro": "Styrax porterianus, commonly known as the sweetgum or American sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiky, spherical fruit clusters. Its bark is gray and smooth, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types."
