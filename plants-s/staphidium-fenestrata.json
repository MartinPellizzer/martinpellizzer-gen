    "intro": "Staphidium fenestrata, commonly known as the fenestrated staphidium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fenestrated (hollowed-out) leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Staphidium fenestrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
