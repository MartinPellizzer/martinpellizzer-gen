    "intro": "Schefflera arboricola, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown of palmate leaves that radiate from a central stem. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries, though these are not typically consumed by humans. The plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
