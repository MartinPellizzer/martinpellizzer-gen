    "intro": "Sorbus eystettensis, commonly known as the Eifel rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. Sorbus eystettensis is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
