    "intro": "Secale cereale subsp. vavilovii, commonly known as Vavilov's rye, is a wild relative of common rye. It is native to the Caucasus region and is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is notable for its genetic diversity and is of interest in plant breeding for its potential to improve agricultural rye varieties. It typically grows in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Vavilov's rye plays a significant role in understanding the evolution and domestication of rye species."
