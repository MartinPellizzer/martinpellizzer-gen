    "intro": "Smilax phyllantha, commonly known as the evergreen smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are often described as having a distinctive, palmate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Smilax phyllantha is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its thick, thorny stems and rapid growth make it both a challenging and resilient plant in its native habitat."
