    "intro": "Semele androgyna var. conferta, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. The varietal name \"conferta\" refers to the closely clustered inflorescences, a distinguishing feature of this variant."
