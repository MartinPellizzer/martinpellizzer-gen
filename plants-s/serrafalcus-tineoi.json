    "intro": "Serrafalcus tineoi, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble small spires. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
