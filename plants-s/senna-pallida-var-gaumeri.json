It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds.
