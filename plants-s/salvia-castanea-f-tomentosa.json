    "intro": "Salvia castanea f. tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly sage, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
