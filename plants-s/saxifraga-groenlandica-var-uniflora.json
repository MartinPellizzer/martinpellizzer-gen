    "intro": "Saxifraga groenlandica var. uniflora, commonly known as the Greenland saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features basal leaves that are typically rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces a single, showy white or pink flower on a slender stem, which appears in late summer. This species is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
