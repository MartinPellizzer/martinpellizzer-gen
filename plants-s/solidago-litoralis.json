    "intro": "Solidago litoralis, commonly known as coastal goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it is adapted to salt spray and well-drained conditions. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences composed of numerous small, clustered flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Coastal goldenrod plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for pollinators."
