    "intro": "Stephanomeria diegensis, commonly known as the Diegens' globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland sagebrush habitats. It has hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
