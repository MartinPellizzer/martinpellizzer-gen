    "intro": "Striga asiatica var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its yellowish stems and leaves. This species attaches itself to the roots of host plants, drawing nutrients and water, which can severely weaken or kill the host. Its small, white to yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a significant agricultural weed in many regions."
