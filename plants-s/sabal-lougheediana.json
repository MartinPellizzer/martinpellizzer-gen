    "intro": "Sabal lougheediana, commonly known as the Loughheed's sabal, is a rare palm native to the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found in salt marshes and mangrove swamps. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
