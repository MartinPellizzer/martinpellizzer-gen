    "intro": "Salvia macrosiphon, commonly known as the giant salvia, is a striking perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, making it a dramatic addition to gardens. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters along the upper stem, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Salvia macrosiphon is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and arid environments."
