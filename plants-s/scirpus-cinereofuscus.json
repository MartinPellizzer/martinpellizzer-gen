It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often hairy and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Scirpus cinereofuscus thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a distinct grayish-green hue that gives it its common name."
