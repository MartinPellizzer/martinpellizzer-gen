It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Sollya species are typically shrubs with small, leathery leaves and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plants are adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their hardy nature and seasonal blooms."
