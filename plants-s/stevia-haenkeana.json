    "intro": "Stevia haenkeana, commonly known as the Hawaiian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is well adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Stevia haenkeana is closely related to other stevia species known for their sweet leaves, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
