    "intro": "Stictocardia pringsheimiana, commonly known as the Pringsheim's lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually yellowish to orange-brown in color, with a granular texture that distinguishes it from other similar species. It is often found in humid, shaded environments, particularly on calcareous substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
