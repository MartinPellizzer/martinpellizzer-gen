    "intro": "Schoenoplectus supinus, commonly known as the swamp reed or narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, and it produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in late summer. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Schoenoplectus supinus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
