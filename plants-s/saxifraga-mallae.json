    "intro": "Saxifraga mallae, commonly known as the Mallae saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and on mountain slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Saxifraga mallae is considered a rare and specialized species."
