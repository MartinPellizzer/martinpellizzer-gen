    "intro": "Skimmia japonica var. veitchii, commonly known as Japanese skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, orange, or yellow berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage, flowers, and berries, which provide seasonal interest."
