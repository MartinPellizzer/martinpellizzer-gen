    "intro": "Succisa, commonly known as the common sorrel, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Oxalidaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Succisa contains oxalic acid, which gives it a tart flavor and makes it useful in culinary applications. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a valuable garden plant and a potential weed."
