    "intro": "Stapelia erecta, commonly known as the erect stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often described as resembling decaying flesh, a trait that aids in attracting pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months. Stapelia erecta is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
