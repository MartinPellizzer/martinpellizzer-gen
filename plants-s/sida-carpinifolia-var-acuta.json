    "intro": "Sida carpinifolia var. acuta, commonly known as sharpleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, erect stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many parts of its native range."
