    "intro": "Salmia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed salvia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Salmia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
