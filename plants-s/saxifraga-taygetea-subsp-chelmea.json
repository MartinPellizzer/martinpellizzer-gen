    "intro": "Saxifraga taygetea subsp. chelmea, commonly known as the Greek saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically basal, with a rosette structure, and are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
