    "intro": "Solanum palmillae, commonly known as the palmilla nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, orange berries that contain the toxic seeds, making it a plant with both ecological and cautionary significance. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
