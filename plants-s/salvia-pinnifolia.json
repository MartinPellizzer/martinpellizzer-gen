It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine. Salvia pinnifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
