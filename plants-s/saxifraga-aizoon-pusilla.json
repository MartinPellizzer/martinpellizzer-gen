    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a small flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
