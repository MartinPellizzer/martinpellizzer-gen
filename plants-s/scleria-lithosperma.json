    "intro": "Scleria lithosperma, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, with small, three-lobed bracts."
