    "intro": "Seriphium perotrichoides, commonly known as the desert goatherb, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Seriphium perotrichoides is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
