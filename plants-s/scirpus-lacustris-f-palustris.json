    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris f. palustris, commonly known as the marsh club rush, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often covered in fine, scale-like leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
