    "intro": "Scleranthus vagans, commonly known as the wandering sandplant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and capsule fruits. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or disturbed soils. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Scleranthus vagans is typically found in coastal dunes, riverbanks, and other dry, open habitats."
