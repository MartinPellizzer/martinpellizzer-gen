    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. okensis, commonly known as the Okinawa needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of East Asia, including Japan and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
