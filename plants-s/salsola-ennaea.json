    "intro": "Salsola ennaea, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Salsola ennaea plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
