    "intro": "Salix sericea var. subsericea, commonly known as silky willow or silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its silvery-white, silky hairs that cover the young shoots and leaves. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers on separate plants, typical of the Salicaceae family. This plant thrives in moist environments, such as stream banks and wetlands, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
