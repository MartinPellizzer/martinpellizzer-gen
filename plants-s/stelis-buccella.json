    "intro": "Stelis buccella, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive hood-like structure. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Stelis buccella thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
