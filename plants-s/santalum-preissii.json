    "intro": "Santalum preissii, commonly known as the Western Australian sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on other plants for some of its nutrients. It is native to the south-western region of Western Australia and is characterized by its aromatic, heartwood that is highly valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is classified as an endangered species."
