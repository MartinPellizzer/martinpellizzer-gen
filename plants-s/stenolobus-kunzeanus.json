    "intro": "Stenolobus kunzeanus, commonly known as the Kunze's lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, elongated lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis and decomposition, respectively. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. Stenolobus kunzeanus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
