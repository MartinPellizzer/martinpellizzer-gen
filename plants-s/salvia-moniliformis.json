    "intro": "Salvia moniliformis, commonly known as the Andean sage or mountain sage, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in dense, terminal spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
