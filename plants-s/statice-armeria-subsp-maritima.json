    "intro": "Statice armeria subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of maritime conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sea thrift is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
