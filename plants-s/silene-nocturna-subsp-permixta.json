    "intro": "Silene nocturna subsp. permixta, commonly known as the night-flowering catchfly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
