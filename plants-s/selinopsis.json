    "intro": "Selinopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Selinopsis species are characterized by their tubular or bell-shaped flowers, which often display striking colors such as white, purple, or blue. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, producing showy blooms during the spring and summer months. Due to their unique appearance and adaptability, they are popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
