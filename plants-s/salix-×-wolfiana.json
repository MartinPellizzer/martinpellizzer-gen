    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 wolfiana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a serrated edge, and they turn yellow in the fall. Native to parts of Asia and Europe, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along waterways."
