    "intro": "Scandicium stellatum var. aucheri, commonly known as the Starflower or Starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
