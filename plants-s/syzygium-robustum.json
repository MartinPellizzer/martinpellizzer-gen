    "intro": "Syzygium robustum, commonly known as the satinwood or red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. Syzygium robustum thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
