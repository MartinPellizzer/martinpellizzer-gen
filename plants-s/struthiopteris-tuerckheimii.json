    "intro": "Struthiopteris tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into shield-shaped segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Struthiopteris tuerckheimii is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
