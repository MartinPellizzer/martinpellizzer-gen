    "intro": "Senecio arbutifolius, commonly known as the bearberry senecio, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with hairy, dark green leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by spherical, woolly seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract beneficial insects."
