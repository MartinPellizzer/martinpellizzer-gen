    "intro": "Salvia pennellii, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
