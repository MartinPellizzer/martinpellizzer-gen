    "intro": "Salix rhamnifolia subsp. turuchanensis, commonly known as Turuchan willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same individual. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing permafrost soils in its native environment."
