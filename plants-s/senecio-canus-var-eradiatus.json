It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and silvery-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators.
