    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 vittata-maculata, commonly known as the spotted and mottled pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, colorful, and often striped or mottled pitchers that attract and trap insects. The plant's leaves are modified into tubular structures with a lid that opens to allow rainwater to fill the trap. Its growth habit is typically upright, with multiple pitchers emerging from a central stem. This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique carnivorous behavior."
