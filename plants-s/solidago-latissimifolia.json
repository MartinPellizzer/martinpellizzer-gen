    "intro": "Solidago latissimifolia, commonly known as broadleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of other goldenrod species. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in meadows and open woodlands. Broadleaf goldenrod is an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators."
