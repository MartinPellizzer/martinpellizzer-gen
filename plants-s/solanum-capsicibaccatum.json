    "intro": "Solanum capsicibaccatum, commonly known as the \"bitter apple\" or \"wild pepper,\" is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are generally not edible due to their bitter taste. It has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and is often found in dry, tropical environments. The species is noted for its potential medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
