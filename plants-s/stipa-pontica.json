    "intro": "Stipa pontica, commonly known as the Pontic needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Stipa pontica thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
