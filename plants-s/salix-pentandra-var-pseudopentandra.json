    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. pseudopentandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. This variant is closely related to other willow species but is distinguished by its narrower leaves and specific geographic distribution."
