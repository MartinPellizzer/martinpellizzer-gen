    "intro": "Sarcodraba dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's sarcodraba, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
