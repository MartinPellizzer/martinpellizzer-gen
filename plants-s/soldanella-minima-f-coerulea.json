    "intro": "Soldanella minima f. coerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered snowbell, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range from pale blue to deep cobalt, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, enhancing its ability to retain moisture in cold, arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its delicate appearance and unique coloration, it is a prized species among alpine gardeners and botanists."
