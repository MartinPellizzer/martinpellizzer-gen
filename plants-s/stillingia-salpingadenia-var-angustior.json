    "intro": "Stillingia salpingadenia var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf stinging herb, is a variant of the Stillingia genus native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces yellowish to greenish flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and requires caution during handling."
