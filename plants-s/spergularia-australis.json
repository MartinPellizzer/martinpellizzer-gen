    "intro": "Spergularia australis, commonly known as the Australian sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal regions. Spergularia australis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
