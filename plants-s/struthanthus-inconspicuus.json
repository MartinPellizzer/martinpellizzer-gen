    "intro": "Struthanthus inconspicuus, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in local ecosystems. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats."
