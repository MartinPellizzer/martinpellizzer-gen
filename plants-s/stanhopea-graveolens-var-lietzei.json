    "intro": "Stanhopea graveolens var. lietzei, commonly known as the Lietze's orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists."
