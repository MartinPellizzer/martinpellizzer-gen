It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The leaves are typically blue-green and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant store water efficiently. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
