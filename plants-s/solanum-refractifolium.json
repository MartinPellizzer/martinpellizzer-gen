    "intro": "Solanum refractifolium, commonly known as the refractive-leaved nightshade, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that refract light, giving it a shimmering appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
