    "intro": "Scleranthus polyclados, commonly known as the common thorned smartweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, often with five petals. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence. It is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
