    "intro": "Setaria italica var. longiseta, commonly known as foxtail millet, is an annual grass species native to the warmer regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop for arid climates. Its seeds are small and oval, typically harvested when the glumes turn brown and the grains are dry. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is used in traditional cuisines and as animal feed."
