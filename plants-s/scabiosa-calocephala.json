It is characterized by its fluffy, spherical flower heads that resemble small woolly balls, typically ranging in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa calocephala is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
