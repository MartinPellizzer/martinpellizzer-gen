    "intro": "Scleria aquatica, commonly known as water spikerush, is a wetland plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like stems are covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often submerged or nearly so. Scleria aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
