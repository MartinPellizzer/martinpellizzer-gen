    "intro": "Salix myrtillifolia var. lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
