    "intro": "Spiraea tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant has fine, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Spiraea tenuifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
