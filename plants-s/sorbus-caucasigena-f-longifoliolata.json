    "intro": "Sorbus caucasigena f. longifoliolata, commonly known as the Caucasian whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the whitebeam species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are longer and more lobed than those of the typical form, giving it a unique foliage appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
