    "intro": "Swainsona tephrotricha, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its rich red color and durability, though it is now protected due to overharvesting. Swainsona tephrotricha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
