    "intro": "Salix irrorata, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, often riparian environments. It has been used historically for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory compounds. The white willow is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing stream banks."
