    "intro": "Sempervivum brevipilum, commonly known as the short-stemmed houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Sempervivum brevipilum is a hardy perennial that is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
