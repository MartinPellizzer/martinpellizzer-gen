It is characterized by its tall, robust stature and its distinctive black bracts that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces large, feathery panicles that are often used in traditional ceremonies and as ornamental features. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. This variety is also valued for its potential in forage and biofuel production due to its high biomass yield."
