    "intro": "Selaginella elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, segmented stems with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Selaginella elmeri is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
