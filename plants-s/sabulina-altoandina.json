    "intro": "Sabulina altoandina, commonly known as the Andean sandplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its small, white flowers bloom in the summer months, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabulina altoandina is considered a vulnerable species."
