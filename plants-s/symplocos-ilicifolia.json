    "intro": "Symplocos ilicifolia, commonly known as roughleaf waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Symplocos ilicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
