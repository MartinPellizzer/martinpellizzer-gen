    "intro": "Silene acaulis var. subacaulescens, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted for water storage. This variety is closely related to other Silene species and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
