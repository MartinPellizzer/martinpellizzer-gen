    "intro": "Silene montbretiana var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in dense, cup-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
