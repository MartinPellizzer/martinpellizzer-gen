    "intro": "Selaginella pilosiuscula, commonly known as the mossy spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats, often appearing moss-like in appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella pilosiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
