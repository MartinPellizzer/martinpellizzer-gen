It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
