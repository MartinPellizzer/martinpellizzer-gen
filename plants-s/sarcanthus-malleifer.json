    "intro": "Sarcanthus malleifer, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in waterlogged soils. Sarcanthus malleifer is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
