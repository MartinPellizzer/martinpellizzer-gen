    "intro": "Stelis janus, commonly known as the two-faced orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with clustered leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its unique floral morphology and growth habit make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Stelis janus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitats."
