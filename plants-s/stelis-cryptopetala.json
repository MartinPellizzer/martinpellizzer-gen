    "intro": "Stelis cryptopetala, commonly known as the hidden petal orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for epiphytic life. Stelis cryptopetala is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
