It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in panicles, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its flowers are composed of many small, tubular florets that attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
