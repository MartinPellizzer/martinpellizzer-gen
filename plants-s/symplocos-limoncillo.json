    "intro": "Symplocos limoncillo, commonly known as lemonleaf or yellow alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Symplocos limoncillo is valued for its aromatic foliage and adaptability to humid, southern climates."
