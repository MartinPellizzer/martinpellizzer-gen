    "intro": "Senecio ephemerus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers that bloom briefly during the winter months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Senecio ephemerus is known for its ephemeral blooming period, which contributes to its common name."
