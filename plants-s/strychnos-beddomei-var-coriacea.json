    "intro": "Strychnos beddomei var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-seeded beddome strychnos, is a member of the Loganiaceae family. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to reddish berries containing toxic seeds. Native to the Western Ghats of India, it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is rarely cultivated and is of interest primarily for its ecological and medicinal potential."
