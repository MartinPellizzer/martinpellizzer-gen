    "intro": "Saponaria holopetala, commonly known as the white soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, soap-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Saponaria holopetala is also noted for its mild sap, which has historically been used in herbal remedies."
