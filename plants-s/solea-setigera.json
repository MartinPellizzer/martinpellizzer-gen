    "intro": "Solea setigera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rosette of leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with long, slender petals that resemble small holly leaves. Solea setigera is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
