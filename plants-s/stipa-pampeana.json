    "intro": "Stipa pampeana, commonly known as the Pampas grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-white plumes that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is well adapted to dry, temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Stipa pampeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a windbreak."
