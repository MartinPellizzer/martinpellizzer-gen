    "intro": "Schefflera amungwiwae, commonly known as the Amungwiwae umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera amungwiwae is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
