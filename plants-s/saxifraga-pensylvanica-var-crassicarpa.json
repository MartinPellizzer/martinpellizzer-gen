    "intro": "Saxifraga pensylvanica var. crassicarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruit saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and shaded woodlands. The plant features clustered, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. The plant's fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation and ecological role in its native environment."
