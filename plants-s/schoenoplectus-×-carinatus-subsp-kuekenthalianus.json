    "intro": "Schoenoplectus \u00d7 carinatus subsp. kuekenthalianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along the edges of slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are mostly submerged or floating, contributing to its aquatic habitat. Its flowering spikes are usually erect and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. This subspecies is known for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
