    "intro": "Salix triandra var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It features slender, often multi-stemmed growth with lance-shaped, finely toothed leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. The leaves and bark contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, making it historically significant in traditional medicine."
