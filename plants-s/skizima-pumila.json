    "intro": "Skizima pumila, commonly known as the dwarf skizima, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible roots. The plant features small, arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across rocky and well-drained soils. Skizima pumila is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with limited sunlight."
