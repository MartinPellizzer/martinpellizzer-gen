It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided as a food source and requires caution during handling."
