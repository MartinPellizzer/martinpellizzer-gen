It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, Korea, and China, where it grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant is characterized by its soft, silvery-green foliage, which gives it its common name. It forms dense clumps through rhizomes and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. Sasa mollissima is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
