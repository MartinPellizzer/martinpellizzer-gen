    "intro": "Selaginella sonneratii, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its closely packed, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytic structures, including strobila, are important for reproduction and are often found at the tips of its branching stems. Selaginella sonneratii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
