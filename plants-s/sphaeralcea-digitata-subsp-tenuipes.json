    "intro": "Sphaeralcea digitata subsp. tenuipes, commonly known as narrowleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly succulent texture, which helps it conserve water. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
