    "intro": "Styphelia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its dense, mat-like foliage. The plant has a compact growth habit, with leaves that are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. Styphelia prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
