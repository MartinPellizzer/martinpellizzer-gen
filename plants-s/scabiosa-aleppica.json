    "intro": "Scabiosa aleppica, commonly known as the Aleppo scabious, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces slender, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Scabiosa aleppica is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
