    "intro": "Senna ferraria, commonly known as yellow senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Senna ferraria is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
