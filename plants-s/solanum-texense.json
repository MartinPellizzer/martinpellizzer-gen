    "intro": "Solanum texense, commonly known as the Texas nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by egg-shaped berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum texense belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains alkaloids, which can be toxic to humans and animals. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
