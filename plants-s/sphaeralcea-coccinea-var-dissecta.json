The plant features palmately lobed leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
