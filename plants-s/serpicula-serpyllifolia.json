    "intro": "Serpicula serpyllifolia, commonly known as common serpyllum, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Serpicula serpyllifolia is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many regions."
