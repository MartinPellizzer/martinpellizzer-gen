    "intro": "Salix gracilistyla f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the slender willow, characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical form. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forest edges. Its leaves are lanceolate to ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces catkins in early spring. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
