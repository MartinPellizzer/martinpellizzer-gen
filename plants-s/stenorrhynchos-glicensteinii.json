    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos glicensteinii, commonly known as the Glicenstein's stenorrhynchos, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are showy, with a unique coloration pattern that includes a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
