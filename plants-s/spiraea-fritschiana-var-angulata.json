It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, contributing to its distinctive angular appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
