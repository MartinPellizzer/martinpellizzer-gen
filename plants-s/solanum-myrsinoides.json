    "intro": "Solanum myrsinoides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing numerous seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and peppers. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
