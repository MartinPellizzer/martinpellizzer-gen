    "intro": "Stellilabium erratum, commonly known as the erratic star-lipped plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped petals that exhibit a unique iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant's leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowering period occurs during the short summer months, producing clusters of small, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
