    "intro": "Sagina nodosa var. moniliformis, commonly known as silver carpet or white sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
