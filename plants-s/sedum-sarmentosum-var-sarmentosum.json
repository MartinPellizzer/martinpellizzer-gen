    "intro": "[WRONG START] Sedum sarmentosos var. sarmentosum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Asia. It features fleshy, stem-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
