    "intro": "Solenandra, commonly known as the golden torch ginger, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zingiberaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking, orange-red bracts that resemble torches, which are often mistaken for flowers. Solenandra species typically grow as rhizomatous herbs or small shrubs, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated for their vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences."
