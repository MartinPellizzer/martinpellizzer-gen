It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a smooth texture. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Syzygium odoratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
