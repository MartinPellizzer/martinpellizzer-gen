    "intro": "Sabatia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sabatia foliosa is an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
