    "intro": "Stegolepis ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rock faces, adapting to harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its structure is compact, with a short stem and clustered foliage, allowing it to conserve moisture effectively. Stegolepis ligulata is often found in areas with well-drained soils and is an important component of local flora in its native habitat."
