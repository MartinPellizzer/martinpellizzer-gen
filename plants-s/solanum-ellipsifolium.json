    "intro": "Solanum ellipsifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its elliptical, narrow leaves and small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces berries that range in color from yellow to red, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. While not typically cultivated for food, it has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
