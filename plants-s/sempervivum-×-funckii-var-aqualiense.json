    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 funckii var. aqualiense, commonly known as the Water Cranesbill, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces striking clusters of pink or red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively easy to cultivate and can tolerate mild frost."
