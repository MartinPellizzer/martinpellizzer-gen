    "intro": "Sapindus salicifolius, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5\u201312 cm long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by spherical, hairy fruits that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. The fruits are known for their mild soap-like properties due to the presence of saponins, making them useful in traditional herbal remedies. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in its native habitats."
