    "intro": "Seseli saxifragum var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-feathered sesame, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
