    "intro": "Saccharum glaucum, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in wetland areas and can thrive in moist, acidic soils. It produces tall, slender inflorescences that are often used in ornamental landscaping. While not as economically significant as sugarcane, it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
