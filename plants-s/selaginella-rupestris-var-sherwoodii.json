    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. sherwoodii, commonly known as the Sherwood's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant possesses a unique ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions due to its desiccation-tolerant spores and specialized leaf anatomy. Its reproductive structures, including strobili, are small and inconspicuous, typical of the Selaginellaceae family. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and sandy soils."
