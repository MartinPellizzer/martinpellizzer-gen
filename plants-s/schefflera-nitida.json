    "intro": "Schefflera nitida, commonly known as the glossy-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of dark green, glossy leaves that give it a lush, full appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera nitida is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and attractive foliage."
