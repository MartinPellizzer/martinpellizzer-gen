    "intro": "Sonchus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid (broadly notched) leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
