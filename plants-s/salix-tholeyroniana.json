    "intro": "Salix tholeyroniana, commonly known as the Tholey's willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
