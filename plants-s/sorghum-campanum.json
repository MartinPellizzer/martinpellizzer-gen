    "intro": "Sorghum campanum, commonly known as the bell sorghum, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sorghum campanum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display."
