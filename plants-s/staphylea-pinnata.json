    "intro": "Staphylea pinnata, commonly known as the common staphylea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Staphylea pinnata is often found in woodland edges and moist, well-drained soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
