    "intro": "Symphyotrichum ericoides var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate heath aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers in the fall, which are typically tubular and attract various pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as woodland edges and sandy soils. This variety is characterized by its compact form and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
