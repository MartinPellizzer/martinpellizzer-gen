    "intro": "Stapelia marlothii, commonly known as the yellow star, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Stapelia marlothii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
