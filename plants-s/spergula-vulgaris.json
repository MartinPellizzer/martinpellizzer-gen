    "intro": "Spergula vulgaris, commonly known as common spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, three-angled berries. Spergula vulgaris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
