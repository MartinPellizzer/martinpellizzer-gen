It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds covered in a fatty, waxy coating. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates."
