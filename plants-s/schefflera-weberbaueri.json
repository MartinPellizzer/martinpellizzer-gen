    "intro": "Schefflera weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like cluster of leaves at the ends of its branches, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters and has glossy, dark green foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black berries, which are edible for some bird species. Schefflera weberbaueri thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
