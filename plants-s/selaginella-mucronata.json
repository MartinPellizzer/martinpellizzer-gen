It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a dense, cushion-like growth form and small, scale-like leaves. It possesses a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Selaginella mucronata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
