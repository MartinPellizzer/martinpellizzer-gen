    "intro": "Sorbus sitchensis subsp. californica, commonly known as the California white-fruit serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The berries are a food source for birds and mammals, contributing to its ecological significance."
