    "intro": "Scorpiurus sulcatus var. subvillosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, often grayish foliage. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a velvety texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. This variety is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
