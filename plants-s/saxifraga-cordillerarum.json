    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerarum, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, pink to red, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga cordillerarum is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous terrain."
