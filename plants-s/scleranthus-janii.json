    "intro": "Scleranthus janii, commonly known as the Jan's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. Scleranthus janii is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
