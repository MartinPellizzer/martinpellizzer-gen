    "intro": "Spiesia aciphylla, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Spiesia aciphylla is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
