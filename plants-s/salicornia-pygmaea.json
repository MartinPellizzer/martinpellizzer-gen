    "intro": "Salicornia pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. It is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae, characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Salicornia pygmaea is often found in brackish water habitats and can tolerate a wide range of salinity levels. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
