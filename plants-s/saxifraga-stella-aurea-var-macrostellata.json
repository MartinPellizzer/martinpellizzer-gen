    "intro": "Saxifraga stella-aurea var. macrostellata, commonly known as the golden star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, creating a striking visual contrast against its silver-green foliage. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
