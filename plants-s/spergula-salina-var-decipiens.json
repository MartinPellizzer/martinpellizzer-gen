    "intro": "Spergula salina var. decipiens, commonly known as the salt marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations and frequent flooding."
