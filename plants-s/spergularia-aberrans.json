    "intro": "Spergularia aberrans, commonly known as the red sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, pink to red flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Spergularia aberrans is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
