    "intro": "Sessea, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive milky sap, which is often used in traditional medicine. The plants typically have a shrub or tree-like structure with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sessea species are often found in savannah and woodland habitats, adapting to seasonal droughts. Their flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by colorful bracts that attract pollinators."
