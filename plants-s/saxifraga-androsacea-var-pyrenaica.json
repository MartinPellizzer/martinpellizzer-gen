    "intro": "Saxifraga androsacea var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
