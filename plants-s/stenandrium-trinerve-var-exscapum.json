    "intro": "Stenandrium trinerve var. exscapum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed stenandrium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered leaves with a distinct trinerve venation pattern. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is often described as having a glossy texture and a subtle aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
