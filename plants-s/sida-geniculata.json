    "intro": "Sida geniculata, commonly known as wild cotton or Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its slender stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed pods. Sida geniculata is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has been used traditionally in some regions for its fibers and medicinal properties."
