    "intro": "Scirpus thouarsianus, commonly known as the New Caledonia bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and fibrous leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Scirpus thouarsianus is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are adapted for wind pollination."
