    "intro": "Setaria impressa, commonly known as rough millet, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Africa and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a hardy crop in arid regions. Setaria impressa is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used as both a food source and forage in traditional agriculture."
