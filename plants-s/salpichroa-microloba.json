It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Salpichroa microloba is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, arid conditions."
