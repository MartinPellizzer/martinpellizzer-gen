    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilissima, commonly known as the brittle willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus, Salix. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and delicate, narrow leaves that are typically a soft green. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it can tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
