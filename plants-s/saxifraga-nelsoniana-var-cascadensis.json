    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana var. cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. The plant features rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring. It has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat."
