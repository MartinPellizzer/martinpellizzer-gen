    "intro": "Socratea montana, commonly known as the mountain socratea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bombacaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the Andes Mountains. The plant is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Socratea montana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
