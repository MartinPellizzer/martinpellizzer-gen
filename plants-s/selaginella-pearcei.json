    "intro": "Selaginella pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem system with upright, spirally arranged leaves that are often lance-shaped. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are formed on the upper part of the stems. Selaginella pearcei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
