    "intro": "Sarracenia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-tongued sarracenia, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and its distinctive, hooded pitchers that are often tinged with purple and red. The plant's leaves form elongated, tubular structures that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to green, and they bloom in late summer. This species is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake."
