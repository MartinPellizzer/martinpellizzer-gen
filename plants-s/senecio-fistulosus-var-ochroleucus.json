    "intro": "Senecio fistulosus var. ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow-rayed everlasting or yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, slightly hairy stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces papery, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize open, disturbed habitats. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its long-lasting floral display."
