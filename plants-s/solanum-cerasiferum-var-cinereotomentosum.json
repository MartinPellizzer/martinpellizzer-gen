    "intro": "Solanum cerasiferum var. cinereotomentosum, commonly known as the silver-haired nightshade, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its toxic compounds, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
