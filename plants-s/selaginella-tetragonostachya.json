    "intro": "Selaginella tetragonostachya, commonly known as the stair-step spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ascending arrangement of leaves that form a stair-step pattern. It is a vascular plant with a sporophyte stage that produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called strobila. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in dry environments with its ability to enter a state of dormancy. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and is also appreciated for its ornamental value in horticulture. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and ecological studies."
