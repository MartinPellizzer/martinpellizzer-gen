    "intro": "Stenocereus weberi, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often branch into multiple stems resembling organ pipes. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, providing protection while allowing for some airflow. Stenocereus weberi is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a slow growth rate."
