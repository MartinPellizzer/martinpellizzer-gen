    "intro": "Sinopogonanthera caulopteris, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect rhizome and bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humusy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
