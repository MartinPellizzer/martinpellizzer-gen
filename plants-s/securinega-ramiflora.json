    "intro": "Securinega ramiflora, commonly known as the branching securinega, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with dense, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
