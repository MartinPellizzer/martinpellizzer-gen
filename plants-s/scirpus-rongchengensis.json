    "intro": "Scirpus rongchengensis, commonly known as the Rongcheng bulrush, is a flowering plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus rongchengensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and potential for wetland restoration efforts."
