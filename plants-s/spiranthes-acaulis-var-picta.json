It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. The flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern, giving the plant its common name."
