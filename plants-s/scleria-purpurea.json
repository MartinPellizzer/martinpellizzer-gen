    "intro": "Scleria purpurea, commonly known as purple-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue or purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Scleria purpurea is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
