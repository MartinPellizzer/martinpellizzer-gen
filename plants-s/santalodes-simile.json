    "intro": "Santalodes simile, commonly known as the sacred sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in religious and medicinal contexts for centuries. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it adaptable to a range of ecological conditions."
