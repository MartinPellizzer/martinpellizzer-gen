    "intro": "Senecio arborluco, commonly known as the tree senecio, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its branching structure and dense foliage. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are usually narrow, slightly hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Senecio arborluco is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
