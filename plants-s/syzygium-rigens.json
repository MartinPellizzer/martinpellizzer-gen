    "intro": "Syzygium rigens, commonly known as the rambutan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny exterior covering its fruits, which are typically bright red or yellow. The plant belongs to the Myrtaceae family and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The rambutan is valued not only for its unique appearance but also for its sweet, fibrous pulp that is enjoyed in many tropical regions."
