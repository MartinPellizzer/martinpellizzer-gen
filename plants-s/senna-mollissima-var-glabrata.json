    "intro": "Senna mollissima var. glabrata, commonly known as the silky senna, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, releasing small, hard seeds. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization due to its hardy nature."
