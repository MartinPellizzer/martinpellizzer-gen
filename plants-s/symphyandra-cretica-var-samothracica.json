    "intro": "Symphyandra cretica var. samothracica, commonly known as the Samothrace symphyandra, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Greek island of Samothrace. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
