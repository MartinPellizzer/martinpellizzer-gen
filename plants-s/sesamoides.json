    "intro": "Sesamoides, commonly known as the sesame plant, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its erect stem, alternate leaves, and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain numerous seeds covered in a hard, oil-rich shell. Sesamum indicum is the scientific name for the species most widely cultivated for its seeds, which are used to produce oil and are a common spice. The botanical features of Sesamoides make it well-suited for growing in warm climates with well-drained soil."
