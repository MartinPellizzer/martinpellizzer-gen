    "intro": "Sida collina, commonly known as seaside cotton or beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, five-petaled blue or violet flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sida collina thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
