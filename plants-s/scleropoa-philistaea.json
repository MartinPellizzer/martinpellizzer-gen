    "intro": "Scleropoa philistaea, commonly known as the Philistine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tough, fibrous leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. Scleropoa philistaea is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional landscaping for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
