    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaraguan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafy, evergreen appearance. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus, through a specialized structure called a haustellum. It lacks true roots and relies on its host for water and minerals, while performing photosynthesis to produce its own food. Sciodaphyllum nicaraguense plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, influencing both its host trees and the local fauna."
