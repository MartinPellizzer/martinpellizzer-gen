    "intro": "Sorbus cretica, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a small shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits called pomes. Sorbus cretica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
