    "intro": "Smilax rettiana, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, opposite leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some wildlife. Smilax rettiana is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets in its natural habitat."
