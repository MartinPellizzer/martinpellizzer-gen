    "intro": "Sambucus pubens var. arborescens, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but are toxic when unripe and should be handled with care. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental in gardens due to its attractive foliage and berries."
