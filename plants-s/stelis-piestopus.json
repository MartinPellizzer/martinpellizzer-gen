    "intro": "Stelis piestopus, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces small, clustered flowers. Its flowers are usually white or pale in color, with a distinct three-lobed lip. Stelis piestopus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments."
