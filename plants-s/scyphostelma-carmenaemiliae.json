    "intro": "Scyphostelma carmenaemiliae, commonly known as the Carmen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on the trunks of trees or moss-covered rocks. Its flowers, which bloom only briefly during the wet season, are pollinated by specific species of moths and bees. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Scyphostelma carmenaemiliae is considered critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
