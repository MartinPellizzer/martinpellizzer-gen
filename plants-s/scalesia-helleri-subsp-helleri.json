    "intro": "Scalesia helleri subsp. helleri, commonly known as the Heller's tree heather, is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It has adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos, including high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
