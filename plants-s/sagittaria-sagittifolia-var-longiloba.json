    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. longiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that emerge from submerged stems. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which bloom above the water surface. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often with a distinct midrib, and they float on the water's surface or remain submerged. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
