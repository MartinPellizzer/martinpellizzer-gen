    "intro": "Salix pingliensis, commonly known as the Pingli willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
