    "intro": "Schefflera minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded crown composed of multiple stems that branch out into clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by small, red berries. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
