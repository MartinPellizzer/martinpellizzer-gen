    "intro": "Salacia velutina, commonly known as the velvet salacia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, velvety leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Salacia velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
