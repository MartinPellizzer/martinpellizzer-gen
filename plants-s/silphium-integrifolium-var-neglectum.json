    "intro": "Silphium integrifolium var. neglectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved compass plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and historical use in traditional medicine."
