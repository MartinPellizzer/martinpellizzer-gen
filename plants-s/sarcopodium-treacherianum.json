    "intro": "Sarcopodium treacherianum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming in the early morning. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
