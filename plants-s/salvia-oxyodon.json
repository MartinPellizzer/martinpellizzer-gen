    "intro": "Salvia oxyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
