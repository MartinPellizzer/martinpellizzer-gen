It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, often with a fragrant, mint-like scent.
