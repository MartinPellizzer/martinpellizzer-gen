    "intro": "Senecio portalesianus var. lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
