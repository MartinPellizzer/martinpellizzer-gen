    "intro": "Selaginella erythropus var. major, commonly known as the red-stemmed spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of foliage and elongated, spore-bearing strobila that appear at the tips of its stems. The plant exhibits a distinct coloration, with red pigmentation in its stems and leaves, which is often more pronounced under certain environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
