    "intro": "Sempervivum hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum hispanicum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including drought and frost."
