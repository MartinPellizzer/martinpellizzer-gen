    "intro": "Scirpus iseensis, commonly known as the Japanese bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in wetland environments. Scirpus iseensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
