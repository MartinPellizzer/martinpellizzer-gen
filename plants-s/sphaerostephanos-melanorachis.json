    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos melanorachis, commonly known as the black-veined star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare and striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a bulbous perennial that produces showy, star-shaped flowers with dark purple veins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
