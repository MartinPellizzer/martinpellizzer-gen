    "intro": "Struthiopteris papuana, commonly known as the Papuan wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Papua and New Guinea. It is a large, robust fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant features a tall, slender rhizome with a dense crown of lanceolate, dark green fronds that are often leathery in texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Struthiopteris papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its striking foliage."
