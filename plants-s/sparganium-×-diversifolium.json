    "intro": "Sparganium \u00d7 diversifolium, commonly known as the fragrant bur reed, is a hybrid wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikes of bright yellow flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance, particularly in the evening. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help stabilize the soil. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
