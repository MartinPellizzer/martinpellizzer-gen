    "intro": "Sanguisorba decandra, commonly known as red sandwort, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Sanguisorba decandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
