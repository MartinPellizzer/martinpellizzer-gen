    "intro": "Sterigma tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly stigmaria, is a unique plant belonging to the family Stigmaraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched, and often hairy stems that resemble the structure of ancient tree roots. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly covering, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and evolutionary botany."
