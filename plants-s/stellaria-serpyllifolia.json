    "intro": "Stellaria serpyllifolia, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and garden beds. Stellaria serpyllifolia is known for its ability to spread through seed dispersal and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
