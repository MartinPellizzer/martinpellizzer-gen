    "intro": "Schefflera hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera hirsuta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
