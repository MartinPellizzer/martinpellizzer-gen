    "intro": "Smilax lappacea var. ornata, commonly known as the ornate smilax, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and secure itself to supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warmer climates."
