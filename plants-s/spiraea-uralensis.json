It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has finely divided, feathery leaves that provide ornamental value throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. Spiraea uralensis is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
