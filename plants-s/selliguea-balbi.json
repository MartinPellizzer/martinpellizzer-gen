    "intro": "Selliguea balbi, commonly known as the Balbi's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a gametophyte-dominated life cycle, with the sporophyte being short-lived and dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition. Its leaves are usually small, elongated, and have a distinct midrib, contributing to its overall appearance. Selliguea balbi plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
