    "intro": "Scleria bancana var. nana, commonly known as dwarf umbrella sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features dense, grass-like foliage with a rosette growth habit, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers that are clustered in dense, umbrella-shaped inflorescences, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in coastal areas or along freshwater streams. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
