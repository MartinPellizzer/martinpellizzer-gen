    "intro": "Sempervivum propinquum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Sempervivum propinquum is also known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh climates."
