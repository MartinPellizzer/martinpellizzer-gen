    "intro": "Salix subconcolor, commonly known as the smooth-barked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, light gray bark that remains smooth throughout its life. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers arranged separately on the same plant. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams."
