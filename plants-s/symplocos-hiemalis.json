    "intro": "Symplocos hiemalis, commonly known as winter snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in short, glandular hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Symplocos hiemalis is valued for its ornamental berries and its role in supporting local wildlife."
