    "intro": "Senecio linariifolius var. subdiscoideus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
