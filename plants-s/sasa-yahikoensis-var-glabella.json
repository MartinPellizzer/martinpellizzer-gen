    "intro": "Sasa yahikoensis var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous bamboo, is a variant of the Sasa yahikoensis species native to Japan. It is a clump-forming perennial grass that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous (hairless) stems and narrow, lanceolate leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical seed pods. This bamboo is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its dense, upright growth habit."
