It is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand cold and harsh weather conditions. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
