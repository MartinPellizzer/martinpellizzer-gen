    "intro": "Schlumbergera candida, commonly known as the white Christmas cactus, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that resemble a cactus, though it is not a true cactus but a type of epiphytic plant. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the holiday season. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular houseplant. Schlumbergera candida is known for its ease of care and ability to bloom reliably with proper conditions."
