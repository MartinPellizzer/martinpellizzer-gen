    "intro": "Struthanthus guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a short, branched stem. The plant's botanical features are adapted to its harsh, desert-like habitat, allowing it to survive in low-water conditions."
