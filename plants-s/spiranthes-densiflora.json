    "intro": "Spiranthes densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered spirea, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and its clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as wetlands, meadows, and forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, making it an important component of local pollinator ecosystems."
