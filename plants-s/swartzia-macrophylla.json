    "intro": "Swartzia macrophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its use in musical instruments and furniture. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
