    "intro": "Salix alba var. leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a variant of the white willow species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green foliage, which sets it apart from other willow varieties. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, thriving in wetland environments. It has elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a striking appearance. This willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
