    "intro": "Saussurea minutiloba, commonly known as the small-fruited yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. Its fibrous roots and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
