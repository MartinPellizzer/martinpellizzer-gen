    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus subsp. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on short stalks above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its compact form and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plantings."
