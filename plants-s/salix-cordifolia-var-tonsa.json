    "intro": "Salix cordifolia var. tonsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Its adaptability to wet conditions and ornamental value make it both ecologically and aesthetically significant."
