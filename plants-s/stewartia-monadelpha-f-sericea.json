    "intro": "Stewartia monadelpha f. sericea, commonly known as the silver-leafed stewartia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is a variant of Stewartia monadelpha, characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by ornamental, cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth and ornamental value make it a prized specimen in horticulture."
