    "intro": "Sphaerostigma hilgardii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sphaerostigma hilgardii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in harsh desert conditions."
