    "intro": "Sitanion \u00d7 lanceolatum, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. Sitanion \u00d7 lanceolatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
