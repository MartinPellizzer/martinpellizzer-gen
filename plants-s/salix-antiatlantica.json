    "intro": "Salix antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
