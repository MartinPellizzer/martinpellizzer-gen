    "intro": "Santolina zamorana, commonly known as Spanish santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features compact, aromatic foliage with silver-green leaves that are densely packed and emit a strong, herbaceous scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina zamorana is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in Mediterranean climates."
