It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Scleria neogranatensis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and ponds."
