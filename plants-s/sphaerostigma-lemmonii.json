    "intro": "Sphaerostigma lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's globeflower, is a rare and striking member of the Montiaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Sphaerostigma lemmonii is often found growing in rocky soils and is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
