    "intro": "[WRONG START] Spatalllopsis ericifolia, commonly known as the Ericifolius heath, is a shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
