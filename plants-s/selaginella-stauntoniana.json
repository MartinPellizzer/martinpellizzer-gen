    "intro": "Selaginella stauntoniana, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often a deep green color. Selaginella stauntoniana reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This plant is also noted for its ability to survive in poor soil conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
