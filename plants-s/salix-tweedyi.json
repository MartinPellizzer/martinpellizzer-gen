    "intro": "Salix tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant has slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, which are important for pollination. Tweedy's willow is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
