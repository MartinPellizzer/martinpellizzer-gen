    "intro": "Scheelea kewensis, commonly known as the Kew scheelea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, slender grass-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scheelea kewensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
