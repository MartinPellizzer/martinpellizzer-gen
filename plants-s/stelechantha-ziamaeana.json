    "intro": "Stelechantha ziamaeana, commonly known as the Zaire orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its survival in the humid, shaded understory of its native habitat. Its flowers, typically small and fragrant, are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, adapting to pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stelechantha ziamaeana is critically threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
