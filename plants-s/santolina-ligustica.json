    "intro": "Santolina ligustica, commonly known as stonecrop santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, silver-gray foliage with a strong aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, adding a delicate touch to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina ligustica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
