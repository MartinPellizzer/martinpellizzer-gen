It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with a central disk. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
