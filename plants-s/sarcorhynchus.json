It has broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing habitat for various aquatic life. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of water bodies. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators. Sarcorhynchus plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
