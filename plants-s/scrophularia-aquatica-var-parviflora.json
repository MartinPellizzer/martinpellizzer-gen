    "intro": "Scrophularia aquatica var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fig, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to other varieties within the Scrophularia genus."
