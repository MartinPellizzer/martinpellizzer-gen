    "intro": "Spermacoce lateralis, commonly known as the small false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual plant with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
