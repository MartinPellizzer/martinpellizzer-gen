    "intro": "Saccolabium macrantherum, commonly known as the large-flowered saccolabium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Saccolabium macrantherum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
