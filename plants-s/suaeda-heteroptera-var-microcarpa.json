    "intro": "Suaeda heteroptera var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically greenish or yellowish, and it produces small, hard seeds. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is often found in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines."
