    "intro": "Salix alba f. argentea, commonly known as the silver willow, is a variant of the white willow characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves. It is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, temperate environments. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a distinctive pale, almost metallic appearance that becomes more pronounced in the sunlight. It produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
