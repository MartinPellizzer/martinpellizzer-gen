    "intro": "Selaginella trichobasis var. strigosa, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it produces microspores and megaspores for reproduction. This variant is distinguished by its finer, more delicate foliage compared to other varieties of Selaginella."
