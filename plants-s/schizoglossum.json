    "intro": "Schizoglossum, commonly known as the \"slender spurge,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Schizoglossum species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East, where they thrive in dry, rocky habitats. These plants are adapted to withstand drought conditions and are often used in traditional medicine in their native regions."
