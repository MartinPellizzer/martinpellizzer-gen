    "intro": "Scutellaria columnae subsp. columnae, commonly known as the columnar skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
