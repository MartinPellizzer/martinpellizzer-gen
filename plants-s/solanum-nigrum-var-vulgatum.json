It features hairy, branched stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into globose, black berries when mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic compounds such as solasodine and solasodine-related alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed and requires caution during handling."
