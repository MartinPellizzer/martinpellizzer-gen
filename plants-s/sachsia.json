    "intro": "Sachsia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. Sachsia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
