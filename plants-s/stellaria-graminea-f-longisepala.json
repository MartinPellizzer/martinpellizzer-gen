    "intro": "Stellaria graminea f. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled starwort, is a rare botanical variant of the starwort plant. It is characterized by its elongated sepals, which distinguish it from the typical form of Stellaria graminea. This plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. It has small, white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
