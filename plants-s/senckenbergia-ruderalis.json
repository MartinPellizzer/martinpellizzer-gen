    "intro": "Senckenbergia ruderalis, commonly known as the rough-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, and it is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Senckenbergia ruderalis plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
