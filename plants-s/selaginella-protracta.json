    "intro": "Selaginella protracta, commonly known as the long-stemmed spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its branching, leafy stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella protracta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
