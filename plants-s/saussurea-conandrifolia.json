    "intro": "Saussurea conandrifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and other high-altitude regions of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
