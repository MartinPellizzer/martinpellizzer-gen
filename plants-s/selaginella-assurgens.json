    "intro": "Selaginella assurgens, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its compact, low-growing structure and tiny, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella assurgens is also notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms."
