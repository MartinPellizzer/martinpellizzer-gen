    "intro": "Scaevola kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. Scaevola kauaiensis is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
