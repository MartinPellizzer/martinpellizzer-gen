    "intro": "Solanum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by yellow berries that contain toxic alkaloids. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
