    "intro": "Steinhauera gigantea, commonly known as the giant steinhauer, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is known for its unique leaf morphology, featuring waxy, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern in the wild."
