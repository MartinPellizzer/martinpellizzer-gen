It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and fragrant, clustered purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms and hardy nature. The subspecies is distinguished by its more woolly leaves and slightly smaller flowers compared to other Syringa species."
