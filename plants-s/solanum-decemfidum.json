    "intro": "Solanum decemfidum, commonly known as the devil's fig, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and the fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both animals and humans."
