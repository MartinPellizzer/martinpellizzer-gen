It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or purple in color, adapted to store water. The leaves are typically narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. This variant is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
