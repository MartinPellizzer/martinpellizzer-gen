It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio subnudus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
