    "intro": "Sophora japonica f. praecox, commonly known as the early Japanese pagoda tree, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is a frost-tolerant plant that thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that turn yellow in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its early blooming habit and hardy nature."
