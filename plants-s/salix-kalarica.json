    "intro": "Salix kalarica, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and capable of stabilizing soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Salix kalarica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
