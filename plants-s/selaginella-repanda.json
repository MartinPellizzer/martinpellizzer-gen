    "intro": "Selaginella repanda, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense, mat-like colonies on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, with a distinctive spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Selaginella repanda is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-conserving mechanisms."
