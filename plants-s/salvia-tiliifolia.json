    "intro": "Salvia tiliifolia, commonly known as meadow sage, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodlands. Salvia tiliifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
