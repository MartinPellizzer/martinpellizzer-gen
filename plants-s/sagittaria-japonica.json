    "intro": "Sagittaria japonica, commonly known as Japanese arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are ribbon-like and often tinged with red. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Sagittaria japonica is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
