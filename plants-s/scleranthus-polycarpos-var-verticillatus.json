    "intro": "Scleranthus polycarpos var. verticillatus, commonly known as the clustered weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems with opposite, narrow leaves that are often hairy. Its small white flowers are clustered in dense, whorled arrangements at the ends of the stems. It produces small, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
