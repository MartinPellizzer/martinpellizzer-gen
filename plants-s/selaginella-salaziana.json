It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and strobilus structures that bear spores. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It has a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Selaginella salaziana is also noted for its role in ecological succession and its potential applications in phytoremediation."
