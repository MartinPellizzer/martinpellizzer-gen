    "intro": "Saxifraga germanica, commonly known as the German saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features upright, branched stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are arranged in cymes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga germanica is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, well-drained conditions."
