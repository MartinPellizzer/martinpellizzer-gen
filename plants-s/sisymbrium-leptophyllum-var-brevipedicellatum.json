    "intro": "Sisymbrium leptophyllum var. brevipedicellatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on parasitic relationships with host plants. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and exhibits a root system that forms haustoria to penetrate the vascular system of its host. The plant typically has a prostrate or ascending growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are yellow and occur in racemose inflorescences, though the plant is mostly known for its parasitic nature rather than its floral display. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
