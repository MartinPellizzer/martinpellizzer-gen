    "intro": "Sedum maximum, commonly known as the giant stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Sedum maximum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is popular in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
