    "intro": "Senecio pinnatifolius var. latilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green, pinnately divided leaves that have narrow, lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, daisy-like heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and subtle floral display, though it can be invasive in some regions."
