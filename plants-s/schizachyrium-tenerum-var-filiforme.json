    "intro": "Schizachyrium tenerum var. filiforme, commonly known as slender threadgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often hairless, with small, narrow leaves that are also smooth and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is loosely arranged, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
