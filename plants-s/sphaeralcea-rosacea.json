    "intro": "Sphaeralcea rosacea, commonly known as the roseleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive rose-like clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea rosacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, showy blooms."
