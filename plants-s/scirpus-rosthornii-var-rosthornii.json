    "intro": "Scirpus rosthornii var. rosthornii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is adapted to saline and freshwater marshes, playing an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
