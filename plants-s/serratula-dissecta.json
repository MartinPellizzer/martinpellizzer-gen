It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, dry fruits called achenes. Serratula dissecta is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
