    "intro": "Schoenobiblus cannabina, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and rocky soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its foliage is generally blue-gray in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring or early summer. Schoenobiblus cannabina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native plant gardens."
