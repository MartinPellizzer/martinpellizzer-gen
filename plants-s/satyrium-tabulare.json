    "intro": "Satyrium tabulare, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Satyrium tabulare is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
