    "intro": "Stachys spinulosa, commonly known as the hairy betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture. Stachys spinulosa is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
