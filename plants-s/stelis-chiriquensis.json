    "intro": "Stelis chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed stelis, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant orchid flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the cloud forests of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
