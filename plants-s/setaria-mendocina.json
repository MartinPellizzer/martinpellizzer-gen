    "intro": "Setaria mendocina, commonly known as the Mendo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Setaria mendocina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
