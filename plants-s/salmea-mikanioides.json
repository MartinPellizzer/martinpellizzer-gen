    "intro": "Salmea mikanioides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure. Salmea mikanioides is often used in ornamental gardening due to its rapid growth and attractive foliage."
