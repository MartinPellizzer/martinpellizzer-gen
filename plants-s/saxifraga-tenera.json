    "intro": "Saxifraga tenera, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
