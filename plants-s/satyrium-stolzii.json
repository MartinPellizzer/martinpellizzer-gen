It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. The genus Satyrium is known for its intricate floral structures, which play a role in attracting specific pollinators."
