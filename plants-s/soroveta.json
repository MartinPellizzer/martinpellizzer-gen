    "intro": "Soroveta, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a striking flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and can grow as a climbing vine or a small tree, reaching heights of up to 15 feet. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape. Soroveta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
