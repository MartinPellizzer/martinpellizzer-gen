It is characterized by its compound umbellate inflorescences, which consist of small white or greenish flowers. The plant produces schizocarps, which are dry fruits that split into two parts upon maturity. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance."
