It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some areas. Botanically, it is noted for its unique leaf structure and adaptability to various soil types."
