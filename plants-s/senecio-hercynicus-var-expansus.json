    "intro": "Senecio hercynicus var. expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
