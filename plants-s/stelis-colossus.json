    "intro": "Stelis colossus, commonly known as the giant stelis orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. The orchid thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
