    "intro": "Smilax larvata, commonly known as the creeping smilax, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to red berries in the fall. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense thickets. Smilax larvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing habitat for wildlife."
