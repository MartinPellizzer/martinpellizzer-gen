    "intro": "Stachys saxicola, commonly known as the rock betony, is a perennial herb native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, forming dense, violet to purple spike-like inflorescences. Stachys saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
