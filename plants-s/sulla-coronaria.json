    "intro": "Sulla coronaria, commonly known as crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in full sun and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
