    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 densum, commonly known as the dense stonecrop, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. Native to mountainous regions of Europe, it is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Its resilience and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
