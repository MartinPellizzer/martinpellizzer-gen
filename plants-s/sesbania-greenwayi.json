    "intro": "Sesbania greenwayi, commonly known as the greenway's sesbania, is a tropical legume native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Sesbania greenwayi is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
