    "intro": "Schoenorchis eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often appearing in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, soil, and debris around its host. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
