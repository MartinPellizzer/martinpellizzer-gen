It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces striking white spathe flowers that resemble a modified leaf, with a central spadix that bears small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular houseplant."
