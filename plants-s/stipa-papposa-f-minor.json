    "intro": "Stipa papposa f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are characteristic of the Stipa genus. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact size and ornamental seed heads make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
