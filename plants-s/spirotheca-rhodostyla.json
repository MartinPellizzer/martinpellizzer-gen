    "intro": "[WRONG START] Spirrotheca rhodostyla, commonly known as the red-stemmed spirea, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy floral displays. It features slender, reddish-brown stems that become more prominent as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of small, fluffy white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. Native to temperate regions, it thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
