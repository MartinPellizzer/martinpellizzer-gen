It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange when mature, which are edible but often tart. Its botanical features include a distinctive bark that becomes fissured with age and small, alternate leaves with serrated edges. This form is a natural variant of the common whitebeam, showing genetic diversity within the species."
