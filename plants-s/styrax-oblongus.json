    "intro": "Styrax oblongus, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by oblong, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its resin has been used in traditional medicine and as a perfume, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance in gardens. Styrax oblongus thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for temperate climates."
