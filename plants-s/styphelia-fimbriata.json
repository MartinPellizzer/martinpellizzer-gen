    "intro": "Styphelia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of Tasmania. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Styphelia fimbriata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. It is an important component of the Tasmanian flora and is often found in heath and forest margins."
