    "intro": "Selliguea pellucidifolia, commonly known as the translucent fern, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern, typically found growing on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The fronds are pinnately divided and have a distinctive translucent appearance due to their thin, papery texture. It produces spores in small, clustered capsules that are often covered in a protective operculum. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
