    "intro": "Salix glauca f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved willow, is a variant of the common white willow. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often longer than they are wide. This form typically grows in moist or wet habitats, such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
