    "intro": "Stelis perexigua, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
