    "intro": "Styphelia lavarackii, commonly known as the Lavarack's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of Tasmania. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Styphelia lavarackii is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cool, moist environments."
