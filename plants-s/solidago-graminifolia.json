It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Solidago graminifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late season."
