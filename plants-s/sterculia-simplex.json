    "intro": "Sterculia simplex, commonly known as the silky gum or silky tallowwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in rainforest and mangrove ecosystems. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy timber and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
