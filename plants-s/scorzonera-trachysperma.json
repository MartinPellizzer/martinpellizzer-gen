    "intro": "Scorzonera trachysperma, commonly known as the rough thistle or mountain thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a robust taproot system and can grow up to 1 meter in height, with hairy, spiny stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, followed by bracts that enclose the spiny, oval-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Scorzonera trachysperma is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
