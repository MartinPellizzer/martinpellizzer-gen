    "intro": "Smilax procera, commonly known as the climbing smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny foliage, which help it climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. Smilax procera is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife."
