    "intro": "Struthiola striata var. imbricata, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species is native to parts of Africa and is often found in forested areas where it relies on specific host trees for nutrients."
