    "intro": "Saxifraga sendaica var. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are finely serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
