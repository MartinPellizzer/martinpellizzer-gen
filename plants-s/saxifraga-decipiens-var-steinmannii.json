    "intro": "Saxifraga decipiens var. steinmannii, commonly known as the Steinmann's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
