    "intro": "Salvia radula, commonly known as the silver salvia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Salvia radula thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
