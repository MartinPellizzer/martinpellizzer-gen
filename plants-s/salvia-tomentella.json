    "intro": "Salvia tomentella, commonly known as wooly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Salvia tomentella is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
