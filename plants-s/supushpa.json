    "intro": "Supushpa, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are aquatic, anchoring it in the mud. The lotus is also known for its symbolic significance in various cultural and religious contexts."
