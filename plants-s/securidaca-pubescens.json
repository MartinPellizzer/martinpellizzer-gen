    "intro": "Securidaca pubescens, commonly known as the hairy devil's bit, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its common name. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a strong, aromatic scent when crushed."
