    "intro": "Sporobolus asperifolius, commonly known as roughleaf sanddrop, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Sporobolus asperifolius is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal dune ecosystems."
