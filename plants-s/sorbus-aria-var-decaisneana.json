    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. decaisneana, commonly known as the Decaisne whitebeam, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
