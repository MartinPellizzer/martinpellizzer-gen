    "intro": "Stelis exasperata, commonly known as the fiery stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis exasperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
