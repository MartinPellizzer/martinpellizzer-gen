    "intro": "Schefflera myriantha var. attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, umbrella-like crown composed of many feathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by black, spherical berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Its adaptability makes it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in suitable climates."
