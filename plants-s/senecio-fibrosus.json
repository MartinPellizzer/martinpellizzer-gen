    "intro": "Senecio fibrosus, commonly known as the fibrous groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
