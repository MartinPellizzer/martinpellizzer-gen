    "intro": "Salix triandra f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and it is often found near water sources such as rivers and streams. Its growth habit is usually deciduous, with leaves turning yellow in autumn. The narrow-leaf willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
