It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Spartium spinescens is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
