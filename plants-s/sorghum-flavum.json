    "intro": "Sorghum flavum, commonly known as the yellow millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stalks and small, yellowish flowers that appear in panicles. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable crop in arid environments. Its seeds, which are rich in carbohydrates and protein, are used for food, animal feed, and even biofuel production. Additionally, Sorghum flavum plays an important role in traditional agriculture and cultural practices in many parts of the world."
