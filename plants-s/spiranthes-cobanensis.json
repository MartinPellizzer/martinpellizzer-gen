    "intro": "Spiranthes cobanensis, commonly known as the Coban spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, spiral-shaped flower clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
