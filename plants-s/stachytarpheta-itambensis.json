    "intro": "Stachytarpheta itambensis, commonly known as the itamb\u00e9 or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. The showy bracts make it a popular ornamental plant, though it can also be invasive in some regions."
