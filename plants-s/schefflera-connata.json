    "intro": "Schefflera connata, commonly known as the Hawaiian schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, with each leaflet being elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Schefflera connata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Its unique foliage makes it a popular ornamental plant, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
