    "intro": "Struthiopteris regalis, commonly known as the royal wood horsetail, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are covered in a smooth, green, waxy coating. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in clusters. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Struthiopteris regalis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
