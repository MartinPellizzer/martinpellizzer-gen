It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in wetland environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshy areas. Scirpus fuirenoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
