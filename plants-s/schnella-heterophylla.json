    "intro": "Schnella heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water flea, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions. The plant exhibits morphological variation, with different leaf shapes depending on environmental factors such as light and water movement. Its small, delicate leaves are often arranged in whorls, and it produces tiny, floating fruits that aid in dispersal. Schnella heterophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
