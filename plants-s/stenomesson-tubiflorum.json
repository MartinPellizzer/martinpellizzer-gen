    "intro": "Stenomesson tubiflorum, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
