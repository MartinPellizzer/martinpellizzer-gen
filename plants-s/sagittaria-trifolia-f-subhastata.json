    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia f. subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are narrower than the typical form. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant's leaves are often submerged, with some extending above the water surface, and it produces small, white, flower-like structures that are actually modified leaves. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wet soils, while its roots contribute to water filtration. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
