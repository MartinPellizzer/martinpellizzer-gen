    "intro": "Sebaea paludosa, commonly known as the marsh spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to retain moisture in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in swampy areas, contributing to its ecological role. Sebaea paludosa is often found in association with other wetland flora, thriving in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils."
