    "intro": "Syngonanthus caulescens var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are densely covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with two to three bracteate flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its hairy stems and compact growth habit make it well adapted to its wetland habitat."
