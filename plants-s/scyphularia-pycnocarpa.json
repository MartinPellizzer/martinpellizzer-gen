It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny, globe-shaped fruits. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Scyphularia pycnocarpa is often found in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to partial shade to full sun conditions."
