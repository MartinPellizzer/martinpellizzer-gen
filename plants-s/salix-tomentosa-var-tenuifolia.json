    "intro": "Salix tomentosa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the silky willow or slender-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray pubescent stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in riparian areas."
