    "intro": "Scaevola uniflora, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along beaches and dunes. Scaevola uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
