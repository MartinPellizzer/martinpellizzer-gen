    "intro": "Selago spuria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in harsh, arid environments. Selago spuria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
