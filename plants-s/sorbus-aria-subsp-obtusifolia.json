    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. obtusifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, often serrated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Sorbus aria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, apple-like berries that are edible for birds. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and slightly different growth habits compared to other Sorbus species."
