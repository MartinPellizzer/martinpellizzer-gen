    "intro": "Solanum humile, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a small, perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom in the spring. These flowers give way to small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum humile is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
