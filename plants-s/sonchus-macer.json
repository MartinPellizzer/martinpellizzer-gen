    "intro": "Sonchus macer, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy, erect stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, spiky fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
