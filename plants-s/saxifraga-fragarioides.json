    "intro": "Saxifraga fragarioides, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often described as spoon-shaped or ovate. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga fragarioides is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
