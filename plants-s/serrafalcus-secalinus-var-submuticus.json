    "intro": "Serrafalcus secalinus var. submuticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically grass-like in appearance, with a prominent midrib and a smooth, often waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing three-lobed, yellowish flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
