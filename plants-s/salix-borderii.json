It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and it produces catkins in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix borderii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and adaptability."
