    "intro": "Sterculia darbyshirei, commonly known as the Darbyshire's sterculia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
