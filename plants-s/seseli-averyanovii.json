    "intro": "Seseli averyanovii, commonly known as the Averianov's seseli, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
