    "intro": "Saxifraga schraderi, commonly known as Schrader's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against freezing temperatures. Saxifraga schraderi is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
