    "intro": "Stipa lagascae var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which help it survive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, pubescent hairs, contributing to its common name. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
