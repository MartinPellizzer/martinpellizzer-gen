    "intro": "Selaginella boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin spikemoss, is a rare vascular plant native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with both sexual and asexual reproduction mechanisms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
