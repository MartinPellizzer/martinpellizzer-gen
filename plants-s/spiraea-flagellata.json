    "intro": "Spiraea flagellata, commonly known as the weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in early summer. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. Spiraea flagellata thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
