    "intro": "Saxifraga unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Unalaska saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is a low-growing perennial with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to harsh, maritime climates. Saxifraga unalaschcensis is an important component of the alpine and subalpine flora in its native range."
