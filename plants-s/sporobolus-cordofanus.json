    "intro": "Sporobolus cordofanus, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Sporobolus cordofanus is well adapted to harsh environments, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
