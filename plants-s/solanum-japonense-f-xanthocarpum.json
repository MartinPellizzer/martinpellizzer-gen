    "intro": "Solanum japonense f. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the yellow-fruited Japanese nightshade, is a botanical variant of the Solanum japonense species. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange berries, which contrast with the typical red or purple fruits of the species. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, white flowers in the spring. This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique fruit coloration and potential ornamental value."
