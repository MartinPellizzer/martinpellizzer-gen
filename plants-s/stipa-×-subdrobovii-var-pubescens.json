It is native to regions of Central Asia and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive pubescent appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
