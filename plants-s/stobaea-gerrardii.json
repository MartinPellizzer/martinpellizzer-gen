It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, spineless stem that often branches into a shrub-like form. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
