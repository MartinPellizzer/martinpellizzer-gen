    "intro": "Sporobolus eximius var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and wide, flat leaves that are often hairy along the margins. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
