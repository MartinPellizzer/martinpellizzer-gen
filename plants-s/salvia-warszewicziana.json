    "intro": "Salvia warszewicziana, commonly known as the Warszewicz's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which help it withstand arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited availability."
