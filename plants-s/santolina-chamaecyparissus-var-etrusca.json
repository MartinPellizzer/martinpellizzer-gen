It features dense clusters of silver-gray foliage that are aromatic and drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice in horticultural settings."
