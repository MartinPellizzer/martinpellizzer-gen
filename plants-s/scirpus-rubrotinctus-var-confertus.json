It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that often display a reddish tinge, especially during the flowering season. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and avian life."
