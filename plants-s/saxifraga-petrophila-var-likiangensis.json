    "intro": "Saxifraga petrophila var. likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments, often growing in crevices and on steep slopes. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient yet rare species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable plant in its native range."
