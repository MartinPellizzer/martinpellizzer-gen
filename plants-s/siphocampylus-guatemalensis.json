    "intro": "Siphocampylus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies."
