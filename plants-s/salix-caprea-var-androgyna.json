    "intro": "Salix caprea var. androgyna, commonly known as the male willow, is a variant of the common goat willow. It is characterized by its dioecious nature, where male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The male plants produce catkins that release pollen, while the female plants develop seed capsules. This variety is often found in moist, woodland habitats across Europe. Its botanical significance lies in its role in pollination dynamics and ecological interactions within its native environment."
