    "intro": "Schismus barbatus var. perennis, commonly known as the everlasting grass, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked, but its main ornamental feature is its long-lasting, fluffy seed heads. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This species is valued in gardens for its low maintenance and ability to provide texture and interest throughout the growing season."
