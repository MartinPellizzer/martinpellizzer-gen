    "intro": "Stechmannia chaetolepis, commonly known as the woolly leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants. Stechmannia chaetolepis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
