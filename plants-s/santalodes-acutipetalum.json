    "intro": "Santalodes acutipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a hemi-parasitic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant yellow flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which it uses to obtain nutrients from the soil. Its roots can also attach to other plants, making it a partial parasite. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
