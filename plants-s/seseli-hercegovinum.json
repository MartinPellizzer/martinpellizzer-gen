    "intro": "Seseli hercegovinum, commonly known as the Herzegovina seseli, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region, particularly Herzegovina. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
