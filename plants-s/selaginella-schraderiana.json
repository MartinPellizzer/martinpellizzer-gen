    "intro": "Selaginella schraderiana, commonly known as the Schrader's spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are needle-like in appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from sporophylls that are clustered in cone-like structures. Selaginella schraderiana is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in the study of plant evolution."
