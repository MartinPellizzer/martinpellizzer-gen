    "intro": "Silene vallesiaca, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene vallesiaca is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and open slopes."
