    "intro": "Sarcochilus weinthalii, commonly known as the Weinthal's sarcochilus, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers with distinctive red-brown markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers typically bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
