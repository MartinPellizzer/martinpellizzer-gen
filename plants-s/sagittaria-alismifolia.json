    "intro": "Sagittaria alismifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters above the water, contributing to its ornamental value. Sagittaria alismifolia is also valued for its ability to help filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
