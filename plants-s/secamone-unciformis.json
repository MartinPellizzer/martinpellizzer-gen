    "intro": "Secamone unciformis, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance that becomes more pronounced in the evening. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
