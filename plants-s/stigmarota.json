    "intro": "Stigmarota, commonly known as the \"giant horsetail,\" is an extinct genus of plants that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. It was a member of the lycophyte group, characterized by its tall, jointed stems and whorled leaves. Stigmarota had a unique root system called stigmaria, which consisted of root-like structures that anchored the plant and facilitated water and nutrient absorption. These plants played a significant role in the formation of coal deposits due to their abundance and rapid growth. Their fossils are often found in coal seams, providing valuable insights into ancient plant life and ecosystems."
