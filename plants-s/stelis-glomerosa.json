    "intro": "Stelis glomerosa, commonly known as the clustered stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Stelis glomerosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical greenhouses."
