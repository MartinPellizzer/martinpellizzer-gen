    "intro": "Sparganium, commonly known as bur-reed, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil near the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its distinctive seed heads, which resemble small burrs, are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur or clothing of animals. Sparganium species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
