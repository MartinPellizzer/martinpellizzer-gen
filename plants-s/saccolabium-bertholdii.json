It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, narrow leaves, and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
