    "intro": "Senecio peltatus, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with soft, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clustered heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
