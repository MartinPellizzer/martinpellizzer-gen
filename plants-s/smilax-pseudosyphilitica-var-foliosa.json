    "intro": "Smilax pseudosyphilitica var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf smilax, is a species of climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features woody stems with thorn-like projections and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vigorously in suitable habitats."
