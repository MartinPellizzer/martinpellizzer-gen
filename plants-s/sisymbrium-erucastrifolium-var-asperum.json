    "intro": "Sisymbrium erucastrifolium var. asperum, commonly known as the rough leafed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a weed in crops, affecting plant growth and yield."
