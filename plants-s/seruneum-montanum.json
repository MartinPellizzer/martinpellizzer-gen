    "intro": "Seruneum montanum, commonly known as the mountain seruneum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Seruneum montanum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
