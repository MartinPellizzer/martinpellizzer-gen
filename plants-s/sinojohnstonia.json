    "intro": "Sinojohnstonia, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to southern China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Sinojohnstonia is noted for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
