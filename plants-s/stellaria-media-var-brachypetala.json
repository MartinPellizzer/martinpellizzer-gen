    "intro": "Stellaria media var. brachypetala, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. This variety is closely related to other Stellaria species but is distinguished by its shorter petals and narrower leaves."
