It is a perennial wetland plant that thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clumps. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
