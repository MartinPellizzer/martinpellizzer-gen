It is a low-growing, succulent annual or perennial that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Salicornia procumbens subsp. procumbens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
