    "intro": "Smeathmannia pubescens, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and finely hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a silvery appearance due to the dense pubescence. Smeathmannia pubescens is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in woodland and heathland habitats."
