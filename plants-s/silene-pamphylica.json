    "intro": "Silene pamphylica, commonly known as the Pamphylian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Silene pamphylica has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
