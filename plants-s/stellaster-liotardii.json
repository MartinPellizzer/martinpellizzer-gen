    "intro": "Stellaster liotardii, commonly known as the star-shaped sea star, is a species of echinoderm belonging to the family Stellasteridae. It is characterized by its distinctive radial symmetry and a central disc surrounded by multiple arms. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a soft, leathery texture with a complex internal structure including a water vascular system. It typically inhabits shallow marine environments, where it plays a role in the ecosystem as a predator of bivalves and other invertebrates. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to marine biologists and conservationists."
