    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. allionii, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
