    "intro": "Stipa arcuata, commonly known as the bentgrass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. Stipa arcuata is valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
