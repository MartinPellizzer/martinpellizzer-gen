It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its habitat. Its leaves are linear and often arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
