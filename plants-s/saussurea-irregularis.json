    "intro": "Saussurea irregularis, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Saussurea irregularis is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
