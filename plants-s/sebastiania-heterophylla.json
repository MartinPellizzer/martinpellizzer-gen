    "intro": "Sebastiania heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-sepal sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which range from ovate to elliptical, and its showy, red-orange flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that contain numerous seeds. Sebastiania heterophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and striking floral display."
