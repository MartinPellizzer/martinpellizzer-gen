    "intro": "Siliquastrum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches in length and have a smooth, waxy texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits called capsules. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
