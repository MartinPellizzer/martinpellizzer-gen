    "intro": "Selaginella hortensis, commonly known as the basket fern or walking fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping rhizomes and clustered, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl as they grow. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper portion of the plant and contain the spores. Selaginella hortensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
