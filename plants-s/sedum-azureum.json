    "intro": "Sedum azureum, commonly known as blue stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
