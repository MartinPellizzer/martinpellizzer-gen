    "intro": "Specklinia glandulipetala, commonly known as the glandular-petaled specklinia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique glandular structure on the petals. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a subtle yet striking presence to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
