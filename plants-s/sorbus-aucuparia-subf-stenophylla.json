    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subf. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a subspecies of the rowan tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
