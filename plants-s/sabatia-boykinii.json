    "intro": "Sabatia boykinii, commonly known as Boykin's sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the tribe Verbenae and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or coastal prairies. It has hairy foliage and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
