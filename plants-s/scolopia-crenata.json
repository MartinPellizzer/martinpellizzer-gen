    "intro": "Scolopia crenata, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and a hairy stem, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Scolopia crenata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
