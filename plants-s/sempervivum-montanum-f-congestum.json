    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum f. congestum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a compact, low-growing succulent with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the tips. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both garden and indoor settings."
