    "intro": "Seriphidium arbuscula subsp. longilobum, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Seriphidium arbuscula subsp. longilobum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
