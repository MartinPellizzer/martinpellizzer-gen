    "intro": "Scleranthus polycarpos subsp. ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Carpathian sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
