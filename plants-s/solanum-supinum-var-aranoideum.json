    "intro": "Solanum supinum var. aranoideum, commonly known as the Arano Island nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the island of Arano in the Philippines. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential medicinal properties."
