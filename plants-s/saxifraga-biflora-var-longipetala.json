    "intro": "Saxifraga biflora var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of white hair. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments."
