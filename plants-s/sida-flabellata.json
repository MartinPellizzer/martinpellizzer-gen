It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, fan-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sida flabellata is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
