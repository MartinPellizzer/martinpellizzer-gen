    "intro": "Sporobolus minutus, commonly known as little wiregrass, is a small annual grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its flowers are spike-like, and the plant produces small, three-angled seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sporobolus minutus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
