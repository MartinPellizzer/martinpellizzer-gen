    "intro": "Senna orientalis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a yellowish, powdery coating. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require caution in use."
