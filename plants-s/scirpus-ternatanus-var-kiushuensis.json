    "intro": "Scirpus ternatanus var. kiushuensis, commonly known as the Japanese bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, typically blooming in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in wetland environments. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies."
