    "intro": "Scaevola linearis, commonly known as the coastal scabious, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive white or pale center. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Scaevola linearis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
