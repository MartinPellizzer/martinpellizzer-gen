    "intro": "Spathiphyllum abelianum, commonly known as the African peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy, and glossy leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces striking white spatulate flowers that are enclosed within a leaf-like bract, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in low light conditions and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum abelianum is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
