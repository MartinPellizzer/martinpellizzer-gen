    "intro": "Saccolabium palustre, commonly known as the marsh saccolabium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist conditions. Saccolabium palustre is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
