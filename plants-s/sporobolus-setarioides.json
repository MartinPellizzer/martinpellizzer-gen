    "intro": "Sporobolus setarioides, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Sporobolus setarioides is often found in disturbed soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
