    "intro": "Stelis anolis, commonly known as the Anolis orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is often found in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees and other plants rather than in soil. Stelis anolis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
