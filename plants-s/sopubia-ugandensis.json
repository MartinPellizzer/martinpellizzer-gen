It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Sopubia ugandensis is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its thick, water-storing tissues."
