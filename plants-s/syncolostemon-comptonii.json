    "intro": "Syncolostemon comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's syncolostemon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the island of Comoros in the Indian Ocean. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
