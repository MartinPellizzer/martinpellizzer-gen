    "intro": "Salix septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in wet, acidic soils. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and its leaves are elongated with a serrated margin. It is often found in riparian zones, wetlands, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The northern willow plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
