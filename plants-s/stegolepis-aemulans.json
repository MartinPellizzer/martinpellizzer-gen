It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble other orchid species, a trait that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, providing a lush appearance. Stegolepis aemulans thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
