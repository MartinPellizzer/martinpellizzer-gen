    "intro": "Saritaea triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a sprawling habit with numerous small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The leaves are linear, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in environments with limited water availability."
