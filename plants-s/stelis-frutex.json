    "intro": "Stelis frutex, commonly known as the shrub orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows as a compact shrub with erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white, yellow, or green, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Stelis frutex is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
