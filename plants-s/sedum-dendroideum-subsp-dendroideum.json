    "intro": "Sedum dendroideum subsp. dendroideum, commonly known as the tree sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape plant. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal care."
