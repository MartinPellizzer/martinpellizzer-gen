    "intro": "Santolina linearifolia, commonly known as threadleaf santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the summer, which are borne on terminal spikes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina linearifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract beneficial insects."
