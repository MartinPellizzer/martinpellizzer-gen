    "intro": "Salix rectijulis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for erosion control and habitat restoration."
