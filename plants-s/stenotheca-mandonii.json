    "intro": "Stenotheca mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's stenotheca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
