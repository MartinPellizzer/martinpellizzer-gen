It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas."
