    "intro": "Selenipedium steyermarkii, commonly known as the Mexican hooded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, hooded flowers that resemble a cat's face, with a distinctive white and green coloration. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It blooms once every few years, making it a rare and highly sought-after species in botanical gardens. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires specific conditions to thrive."
