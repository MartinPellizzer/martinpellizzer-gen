    "intro": "Sericocarpus acutisquamosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silverweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-tomentose leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces achene fruits that are covered in a silky, hairy layer, which aids in seed dispersal. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Sericocarpus acutisquamosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
