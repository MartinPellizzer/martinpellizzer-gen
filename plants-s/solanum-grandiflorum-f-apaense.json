    "intro": "Solanum grandiflorum f. apaense, commonly known as the Apa mountain nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Its berries, which are small and usually yellow or red when mature, contain toxic alkaloids and are not edible. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
