    "intro": "Santolina millefolium, commonly known as silver thyme or sweet santolina, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and gray-green foliage that is densely covered with fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Santolina millefolium is also valued in herbal medicine for its aromatic properties and mild antiseptic qualities."
