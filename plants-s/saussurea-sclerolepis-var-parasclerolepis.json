    "intro": "Saussurea sclerolepis var. parasclerolepis, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stem and yellowish to reddish flower heads. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its slightly different morphology and habitat preferences."
