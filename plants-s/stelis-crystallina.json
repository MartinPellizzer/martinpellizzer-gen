    "intro": "Stelis crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, translucent appearance due to the presence of fine, crystalline structures on the petals. Stelis crystallina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique aesthetic and relatively easy care requirements."
