    "intro": "Serianthes margaretiae, commonly known as Margaret's ironwood, is a rare and woody tree native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by winged fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest habitats, often growing in dry or sandy soils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Serianthes margaretiae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
