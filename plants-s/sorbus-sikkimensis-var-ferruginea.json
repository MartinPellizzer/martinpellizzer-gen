    "intro": "Sorbus sikkimensis var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is often covered in a rusty-colored, flaky exfoliating layer, giving it its common name. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
