    "intro": "Setaria ambigua var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf foxtail, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
