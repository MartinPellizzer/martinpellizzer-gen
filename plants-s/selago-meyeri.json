    "intro": "Selago meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's selago, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Selago meyeri is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
