    "intro": "Spirostylis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered spirostylis, is a striking member of the Myrtaceae family native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling inflorescence that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in pairs, hence the species name *biflora*. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture. Spirostylis biflora is often found in sandy soils near coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
