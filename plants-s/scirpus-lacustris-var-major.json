    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris var. major, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, marshes, and pond edges, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. The plant has fibrous roots that help prevent erosion, and its leaves are often used in traditional crafts or as a source of fiber. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dark, spherical berries, which are an important food source for waterfowl and other wildlife. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy aquatic ecosystems."
