    "intro": "Senefelderopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Senefelderopsis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in wetlands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
