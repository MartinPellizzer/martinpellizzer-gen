The plant has hairy, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Samolus pyrolifolius is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
