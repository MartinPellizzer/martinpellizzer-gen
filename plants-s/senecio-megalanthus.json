    "intro": "Senecio megalanthus, commonly known as the giant groundsel, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features a sturdy, branched stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
