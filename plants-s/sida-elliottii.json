    "intro": "Sida elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a soft, hairy texture and produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wet environments. Sida elliottii is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
