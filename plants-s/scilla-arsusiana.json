    "intro": "Scilla arsusiana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to their hardiness and ornamental value. Scilla arsusiana is also valued for its early blooming habit, adding color to gardens in late winter or early spring."
