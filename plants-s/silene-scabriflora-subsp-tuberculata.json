    "intro": "Silene scabriflora subsp. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Its subspecific name, *tuberculata*, refers to the tuberculate (wart-like) structures on its stems and leaves."
