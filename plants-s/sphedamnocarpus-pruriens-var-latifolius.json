    "intro": "Sphedamnocarpus pruriens var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf itching bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its irritating properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
