It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, yellowish-green inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. Setaria panis is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
