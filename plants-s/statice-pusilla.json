    "intro": "Statice pusilla, commonly known as sea thrift, is a small, hardy flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, colorful flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its salt tolerance and resilience to harsh maritime conditions make it a popular choice for coastal landscaping. Statice pusilla is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
