It features fleshy, upright stems and small, pale green or yellowish leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Sedum peregrinum is popular in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
