    "intro": "Scilla albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers with distinct white margins, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are relatively small and white in color. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, often growing in woodland or rocky habitats. Scilla albomarginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
