    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 praegaudens, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a rough texture and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist soils."
