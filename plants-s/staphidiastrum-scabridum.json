It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native habitat."
