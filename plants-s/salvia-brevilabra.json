    "intro": "Salvia brevilabra, commonly known as the narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, violet to blue-purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia brevilabra is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
