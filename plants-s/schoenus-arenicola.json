    "intro": "Schoenus arenicola, commonly known as the sandy couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Schoenus arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
