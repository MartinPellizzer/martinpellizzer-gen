    "intro": "Sedum anglicum subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid and rocky environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ability to tolerate cold temperatures allows it to flourish in temperate and subalpine climates."
