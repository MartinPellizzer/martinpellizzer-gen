    "intro": "Santaloides luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, woody structure and reduced leaves. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. It is often found growing on the roots of other trees, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
