    "intro": "Simocheilus patens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Simocheilus patens plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
