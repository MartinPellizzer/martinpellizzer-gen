    "intro": "Scilla bifolia subsp. drunensis, commonly known as the Drunian scilla, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of the Balkans. It is a bulbous perennial that produces clusters of striking blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
