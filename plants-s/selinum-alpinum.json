    "intro": "Selinum alpinum, commonly known as alpine garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and aromatic, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves and roots contain sulfur compounds that give it a strong, pungent odor. Selinum alpinum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations."
