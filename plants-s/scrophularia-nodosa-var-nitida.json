    "intro": "Scrophularia nodosa var. nitida, commonly known as the glossy scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape with a distinctive glossy surface. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display."
