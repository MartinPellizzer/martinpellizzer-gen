    "intro": "Sonchus pinnatifidus var. pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lanceolate to linear, with a distinctive pinnatifid (deeply lobed) shape, and are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by small, spiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
