    "intro": "Sambucus pubens var. heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of seven leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and wildlife."
