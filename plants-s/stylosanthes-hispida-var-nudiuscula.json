    "intro": "Stylosanthes hispida var. nudiuscula, commonly known as the hairy stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, hairy leaves that are trifoliate in structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, followed by legumes that contain several elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in forage and soil conservation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
