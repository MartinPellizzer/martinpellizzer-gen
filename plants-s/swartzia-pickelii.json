    "intro": "Swartzia pickelii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also threatened by overharvesting. Swartzia pickelii typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and montane forests."
