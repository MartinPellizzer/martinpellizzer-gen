    "intro": "Scolopia parkinsonii, commonly known as the Texas false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Scolopia parkinsonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native pollinators."
