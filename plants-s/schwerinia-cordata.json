    "intro": "Schwerinia cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy, and its clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Schwerinia cordata is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
