    "intro": "Sonchus laevis, commonly known as the white sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are edible when young but can become bitter and less palatable as the plant matures. Sonchus laevis has a taproot system and reproduces through seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals."
