    "intro": "Strychnos tetragona, commonly known as the four-angle strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody, spindle-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds, which contain the alkaloids strychnine and brucine. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for ornamental or medicinal use, though it has been studied for its chemical composition."
