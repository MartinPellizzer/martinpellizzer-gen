    "intro": "Stoebe plumosa, commonly known as silky geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, and it produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas. Stoebe plumosa is also known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
