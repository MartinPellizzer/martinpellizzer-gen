It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, with a leathery texture, and the fruit is a small, dark purple drupe. Syzygium fazangii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
