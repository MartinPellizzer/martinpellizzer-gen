The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are flat and narrow, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus complanatus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects, birds, and small mammals."
