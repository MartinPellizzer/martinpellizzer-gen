    "intro": "Sinobambusa nandanensis, commonly known as the Nandanensis bamboo, is a species native to China, particularly found in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. It is a tall, slender bamboo that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with slender culms that are often used in traditional Chinese architecture and crafts. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. Sinobambusa nandanensis is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
