    "intro": "Stipa scabra var. pallida, commonly known as the pale silky grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale spikelets that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
