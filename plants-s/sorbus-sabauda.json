    "intro": "Sorbus sabauda, commonly known as the Alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by edible berries that are dark red to black in color. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with finely toothed margins and a bluish-green upper surface. Sorbus sabauda is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
