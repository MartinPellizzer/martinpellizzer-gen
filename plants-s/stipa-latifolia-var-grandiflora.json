    "intro": "Stipa latifolia var. grandiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf feathergrass, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to landscapes. The variety grandiflora is distinguished by its larger, more showy flower heads compared to the typical form of S. latifolia."
