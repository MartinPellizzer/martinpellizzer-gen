    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. prostrata, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a low-growing, succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of salt. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other habitats with high salt content. Its ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves makes it an important component of salt-tolerant ecosystems."
