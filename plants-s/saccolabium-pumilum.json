    "intro": "Saccolabium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sicklepod, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, and the plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Saccolabium pumilum is adapted to arid environments and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
