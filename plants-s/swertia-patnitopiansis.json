    "intro": "Swertia patnitopiansis, commonly known as the Himalayan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,000 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. The flowers bloom during the summer months and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies."
