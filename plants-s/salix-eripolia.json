    "intro": "Salix eripolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowers, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and swampy areas. Salix eripolia is known for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
