    "intro": "Schoenoplectus orthorhizomatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spadix-like flowers. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in moist to wet soils. It is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife makes it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
