    "intro": "Salix integra f. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-veined weeping willow, is a unique cultivar of the weeping willow tree. It is characterized by its striking white and green variegated leaves that contrast beautifully with its cascading, slender branches. The plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and graceful appearance. Due to its slow growth rate, it is suitable for smaller gardens or as a specimen plant."
