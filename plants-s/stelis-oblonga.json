    "intro": "Stelis oblonga, commonly known as the oblong lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, compact growth habit with a short, creeping rhizome and a dense cluster of linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem that bears a loose raceme of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their three-lobed sepals and petals, with a distinctive spur at the base of the lip. Stelis oblonga thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild."
