It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and produces striking clusters of bright red flowers with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The flowers bloom during the warm season, adding vibrant color to the surrounding vegetation."
