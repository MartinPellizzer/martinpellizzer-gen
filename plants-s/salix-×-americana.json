    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 americana, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are broad, oval, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. The weeping willow is often planted for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive near water sources."
