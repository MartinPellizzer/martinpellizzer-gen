It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it tolerates cool temperatures and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely available."
