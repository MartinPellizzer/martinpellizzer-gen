    "intro": "Scirpus triqueter var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its triangular, ribbed stems and dense clusters of small, spadix-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they often form a rosette at the base. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing habitat for aquatic life."
