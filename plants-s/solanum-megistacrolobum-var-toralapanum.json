    "intro": "Solanum megistacrolobum var. toralapanum, commonly known as the Toralapanum nightshade, is a shrub native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, tomatoes, and potatoes. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens to a deep red, containing several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies."
