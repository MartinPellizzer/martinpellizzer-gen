It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
