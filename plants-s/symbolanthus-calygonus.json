    "intro": "Symbolanthus calygonus, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a striking contrast between the flower and its velvety, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Symbolanthus calygonus is a climbing vine that can grow quite long, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in suitable environments."
