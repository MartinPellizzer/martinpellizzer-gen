    "intro": "Selaginella martensii var. robusta, commonly known as the clubmoss or spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and root-like structures called rhizophores, which help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
