    "intro": "Stryphnodendron gracile, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and smooth, light-colored bark. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
