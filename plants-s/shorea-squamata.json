    "intro": "Shorea squamata, commonly known as the yellow meranti or white meranti, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, pale bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and elongated, fibrous fruits that contain winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its strength, durability, and workability, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
