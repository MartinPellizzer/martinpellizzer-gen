    "intro": "Solanum pterocaulum var. deppei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctively narrow appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, toxic berries that are edible only when fully ripe. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
