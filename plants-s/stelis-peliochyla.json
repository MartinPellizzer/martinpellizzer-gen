It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. The flowers are usually pale pink to purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more prominent."
