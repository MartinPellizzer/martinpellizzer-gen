    "intro": "Schoenocaulon megarrhizum var. megarrhizum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
