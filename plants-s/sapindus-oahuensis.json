    "intro": "Sapindus oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu soapberry, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, orange-red fruits that split open to reveal a cluster of seeds. Its fruits are notable for their soapy texture, which gives the plant its common name. This species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii and is an important component of the local flora."
