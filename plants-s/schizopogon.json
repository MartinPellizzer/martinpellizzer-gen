    "intro": "Schizopogon, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that often appear in tufts. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compressed flower clusters. Schizopogon species are typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. They are known for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and are often used in ecological restoration projects."
