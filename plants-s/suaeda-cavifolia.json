    "intro": "Suaeda cavifolia, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its roots are adapted to excrete excess salt, making it highly tolerant of saline soils. Suaeda cavifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion."
