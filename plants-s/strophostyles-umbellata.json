    "intro": "Strophostyles umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences called umbels, which give it its common name. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish and are followed by small, three-angled berries. Strophostyles umbellata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
