It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Salix yanbianica is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and forest edges."
