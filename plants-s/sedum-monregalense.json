    "intro": "Sedum monregalense, commonly known as the Monregalense stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
