    "intro": "Sclerochloa dura var. arenosa, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tough, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
