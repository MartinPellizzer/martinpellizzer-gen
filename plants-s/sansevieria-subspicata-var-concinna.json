It features long, narrow, upright leaves that are typically dark green with subtle yellow or white markings. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in low light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an ideal houseplant. Its leaves are often ribbed and have a waxy texture, which helps it store water efficiently. This variety is prized for its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
