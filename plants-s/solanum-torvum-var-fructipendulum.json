It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
