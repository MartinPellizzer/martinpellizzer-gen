    "intro": "Stobaea oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved stobaea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
