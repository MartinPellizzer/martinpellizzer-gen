    "intro": "Stelis scalena, commonly known as the scalene stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, strap-like leaves. Its flowers are usually small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in a spike. Stelis scalena is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
