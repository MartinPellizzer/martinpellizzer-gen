    "intro": "Sedum ochroleucum subsp. mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
