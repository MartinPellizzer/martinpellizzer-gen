    "intro": "Senecio kalmii, commonly known as Kalm's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and have a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Senecio kalmii is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by Native American tribes."
