    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 monandra var. monadelpha, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a light green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive near water sources."
