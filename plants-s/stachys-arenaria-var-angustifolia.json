    "intro": "Stachys arenaria var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces spikes of purple or blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as gravelly slopes and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh environments with limited moisture."
