    "intro": "Salix columbiae, commonly known as the Columbia willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green catkins. The plant thrives in moist, often riparian environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Salix columbiae plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native habitat."
