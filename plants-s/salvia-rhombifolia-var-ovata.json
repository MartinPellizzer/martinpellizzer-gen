    "intro": "Salvia rhombifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features lance-shaped, slightly hairy leaves that are broader than those of the typical salvia species. The plant produces striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms."
