    "intro": "Sphenogyne chamaemeloides, commonly known as the creeping tansy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist or shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage contains compounds that have been historically used in herbal medicine, though it is generally considered toxic in large quantities. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of native plant ecosystems."
