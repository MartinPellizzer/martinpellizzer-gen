    "intro": "Salvia chloroleuca, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and striking spikes of pale blue to white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and traditional herbal practices. Salvia chloroleuca is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
