It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. The plant features a compact rosette of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically blue or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
