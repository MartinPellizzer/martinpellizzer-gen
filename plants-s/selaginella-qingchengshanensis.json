    "intro": "Selaginella qingchengshanensis, commonly known as the Qingchengshan spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to China. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, cone-like structures that produce spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, its population is under significant threat."
