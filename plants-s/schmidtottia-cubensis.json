    "intro": "Schmidtottia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Schmidtottia cubensis has lance-shaped leaves and produces a unique, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
