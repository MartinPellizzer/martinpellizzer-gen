    "intro": "Selaginella plumosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
