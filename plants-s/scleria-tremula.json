    "intro": "Scleria tremula, commonly known as the trembling bulrush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleria tremula typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
