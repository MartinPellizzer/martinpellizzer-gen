    "intro": "Spergularia microspermoides, commonly known as the small-seeded sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or saline environments. Spergularia microspermoides is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal and semi-arid flora."
