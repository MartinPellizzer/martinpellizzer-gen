    "intro": "Streptopus amplexifolius var. oreopolus, commonly known as the Oregon crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that often curl around the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme at the end of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
