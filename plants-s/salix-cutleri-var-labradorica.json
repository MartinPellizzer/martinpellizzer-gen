It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and coastal areas. The plant has slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
