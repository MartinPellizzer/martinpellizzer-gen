It is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl as the plant matures. The plant belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is known for its robust, upright growth habit. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, fuzzy texture on the underside. Strongyloma struthionum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
