    "intro": "Salix pomeranica, commonly known as the goat willow, is a species of willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows along riverbanks and in moist, temperate environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and catkin-like flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture and a distinct midrib. Salix pomeranica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
