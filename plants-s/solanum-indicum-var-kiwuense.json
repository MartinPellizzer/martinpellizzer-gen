    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. kiwuense, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
