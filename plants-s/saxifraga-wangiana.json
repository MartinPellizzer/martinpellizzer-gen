    "intro": "Saxifraga wangiana, commonly known as the Wangiana saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with dense, rosette-like foliage that helps it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to low light conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
