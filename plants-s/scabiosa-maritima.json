    "intro": "Scabiosa maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, thistle-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline and windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and coastal grasslands. Scabiosa maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
