    "intro": "Spiranthes pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered spiral orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and supports microbial life. Spiranthes pauciflora is valued for its ecological role and is often found in conservation efforts due to its habitat specificity."
