    "intro": "Serianthes kanehirae, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, iron-hard wood, which gives it its common name and makes it highly valued for traditional canoe building. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats within the native forests of Kauai. Due to habitat loss and limited seed viability, Serianthes kanehirae is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
