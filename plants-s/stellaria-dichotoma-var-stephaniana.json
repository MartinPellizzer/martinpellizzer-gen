    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma var. stephaniana, commonly known as the stephanian mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its small, pale green leaves and tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its dichotomous branching pattern and its association with the genus Stellaria, which includes many star-shaped flowers. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form."
