    "intro": "Solanum secedens, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that give way to berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
