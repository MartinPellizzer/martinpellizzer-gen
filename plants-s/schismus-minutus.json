    "intro": "Schismus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf schismus, is a small annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, narrow leaves and clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed areas effectively. Due to its low profile and rapid growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
