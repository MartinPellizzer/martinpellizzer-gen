    "intro": "Styloglossum lyroglossum, commonly known as the lyre-lipped orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, lyre-shaped lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor or as an epiphyte. Its flowers are small and colorful, often displaying shades of pink, purple, and white, which attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
