    "intro": "Stevia bangii var. dyscrita, commonly known as the red stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often red or pink in color, which distinguish it from other stevia varieties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, making it a popular natural sweetener. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
