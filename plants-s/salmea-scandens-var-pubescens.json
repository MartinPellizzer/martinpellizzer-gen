It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands or along fences. Its hairy texture provides a unique adaptation for moisture retention and protection against herbivores."
