    "intro": "Senecio eligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer months. Senecio eligulatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
