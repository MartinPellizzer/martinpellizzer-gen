    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella orthorhizomata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bur-reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base, with flowering stems that rise above the foliage. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Schoenoplectiella orthorhizomata has rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively and survive in fluctuating water levels."
