    "intro": "Stelis colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, helping it store water and nutrients. Stelis colombiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
