    "intro": "Sansevieria polyphylla, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, spiral arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the growing season, though it is more notable for its foliage than its blooms. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Sansevieria polyphylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal and low maintenance requirements."
