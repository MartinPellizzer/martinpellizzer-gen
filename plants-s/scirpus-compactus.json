    "intro": "Scirpus compactus, commonly known as the compact tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and typically grows in clusters, forming tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown flowers in spikes during the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Scirpus compactus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
