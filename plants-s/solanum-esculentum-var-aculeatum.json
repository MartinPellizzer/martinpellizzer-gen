It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruits are similar to regular tomatoes but are often smaller and have a more acidic flavor. This variety is less commonly cultivated than standard tomatoes but is appreciated for its unique texture and appearance."
