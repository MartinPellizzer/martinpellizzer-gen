    "intro": "Sporobolus torreyanus, commonly known as Torrey's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in panicle-like structures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus torreyanus is well adapted to drought conditions and is an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
