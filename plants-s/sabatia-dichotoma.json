    "intro": "Sabatia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked pink, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals that are often tinged with purple. Sabatia dichotoma plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich blooms."
