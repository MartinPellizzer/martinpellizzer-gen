    "intro": "Syringodea pinea, commonly known as the pineapple lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that resemble a pineapple, with a dense cluster of red or orange bracts surrounding its actual blooms. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are narrow and pointed, contributing to its elegant appearance. Syringodea pinea thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
