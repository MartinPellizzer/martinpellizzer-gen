    "intro": "Spiranthes itararensis, commonly known as the Itarare orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
