    "intro": "Senecio lautus var. montanus, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or talus slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, sharing structural similarities with other members of the sunflower family."
