    "intro": "Silphium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved compass plant, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the central United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and dry habitats. Historically, it was valued for its edible roots and medicinal properties."
