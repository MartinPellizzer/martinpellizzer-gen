It is a shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sclerocladus tenax plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
