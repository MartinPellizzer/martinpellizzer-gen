    "intro": "Sempervivum caucasicum var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender houseleek, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to the Caucasus region. It features fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges, especially in cooler conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, though it prefers well-draining soil."
