    "intro": "Schnella nigra, commonly known as black schnella, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Primulaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. The plant features dark green, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schnella nigra is considered a rare and endangered species."
