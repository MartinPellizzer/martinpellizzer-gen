    "intro": "Sagina litoralis, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves and stems help it retain moisture in arid or salty conditions. Sagina litoralis is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
