    "intro": "Solidago rugosa f. villosa, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"rugosa\" meaning rough. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
