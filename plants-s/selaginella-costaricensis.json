    "intro": "Selaginella costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a characteristic appearance with spiral-arranged leaves and a creeping rhizome that produces upright shoots. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are formed at the tips of the shoots, facilitating spore dispersal. Selaginella costaricensis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
