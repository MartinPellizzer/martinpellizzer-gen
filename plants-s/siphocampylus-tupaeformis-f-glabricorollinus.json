    "intro": "Siphocampylus tupaeformis f. glabricorollinus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, glabrous stems that are often covered in a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, adapted to its rocky and arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
