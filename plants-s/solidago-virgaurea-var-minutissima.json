    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky habitats. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a valuable role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
