It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white powder. It is valued in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal or maritime conditions."
