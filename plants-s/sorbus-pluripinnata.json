    "intro": "Sorbus pluripinnata, commonly known as the many-lobed whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
