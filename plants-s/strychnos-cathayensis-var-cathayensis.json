    "intro": "Strychnos cathayensis var. cathayensis, commonly known as the Chinese strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is notable for containing alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine, which are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and is primarily of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
