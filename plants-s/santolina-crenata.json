    "intro": "Santolina crenata, commonly known as silver mound santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact foliage composed of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Santolina crenata is known for its hardiness and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
