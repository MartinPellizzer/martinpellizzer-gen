    "intro": "Statice obovata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. Statice obovata is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
