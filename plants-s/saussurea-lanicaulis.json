    "intro": "Saussurea lanicaulis, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
