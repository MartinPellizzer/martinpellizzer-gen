    "intro": "Steganthera chimbuensis, commonly known as the Chimbu sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, succulent leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
