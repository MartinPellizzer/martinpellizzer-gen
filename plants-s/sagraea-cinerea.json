    "intro": "Sagraea cinerea, commonly known as the gray sagraea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
