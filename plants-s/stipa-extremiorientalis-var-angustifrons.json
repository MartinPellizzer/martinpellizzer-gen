    "intro": "Stipa extremiorientalis var. angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fruited feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that turns a striking golden hue in autumn. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical spikelets that are adorned with small, bristle-like florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
