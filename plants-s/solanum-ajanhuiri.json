    "intro": "Solanum ajanhuiri, commonly known as the Amazonian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Peruvian Amazon. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making it both a botanical curiosity and a cautionary example of plant toxicity. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in dense rainforest undergrowth. Due to its medicinal properties and potential for misuse, it is a subject of ongoing botanical and pharmacological study."
