    "intro": "Sphaeropuntia sphaerica subsp. leucophaea, commonly known as the white-tipped prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that are typically light green to whitish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive white-tipped spines and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
