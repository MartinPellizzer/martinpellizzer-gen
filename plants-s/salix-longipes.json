    "intro": "Salix longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its flowers are small and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix longipes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native environment."
