    "intro": "Sceptridium minus, commonly known as the lesser tamarisk, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, woody stems, and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. Sceptridium minus is often found in washes, dunes, and other disturbed or marginal habitats."
