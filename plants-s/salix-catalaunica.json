    "intro": "Salix catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalaunian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically male and female, with the female catkins appearing later in the season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. Salix catalaunica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological habitats."
