    "intro": "Saxifraga presolanensis, commonly known as the Andean saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its alpine environment. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Saxifraga presolanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
