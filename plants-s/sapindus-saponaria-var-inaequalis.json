    "intro": "Sapindus saponaria var. inaequalis, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of ovate to elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits that turn red when mature. The fruits contain a single seed surrounded by a starchy, soap-like pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural detergent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
