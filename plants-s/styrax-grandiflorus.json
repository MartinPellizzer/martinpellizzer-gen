    "intro": "Styrax grandiflorus, commonly known as the largeflower styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a heavy, aromatic resin that has been historically used in incense and perfumes. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for gardens. Styrax grandiflorus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
