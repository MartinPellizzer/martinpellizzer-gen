    "intro": "Strigosella tadzhikistanica, commonly known as the Tajikistan lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth and tightly adherent texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on limestone or granite substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
