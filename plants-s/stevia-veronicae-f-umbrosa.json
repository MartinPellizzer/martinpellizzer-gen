    "intro": "Stevia veronicae f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving stevia, is a variant of the stevia plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green foliage. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are used as a natural sweetener, similar to other stevia species, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use. This variety is valued for its adaptability to partial shade and its role in ecological gardening."
