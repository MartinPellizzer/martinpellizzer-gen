    "intro": "Spergularia rubra subsp. echinosperma, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain minute seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited to harsh, dry habitats."
