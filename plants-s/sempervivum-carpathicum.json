It features dense clusters of fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
