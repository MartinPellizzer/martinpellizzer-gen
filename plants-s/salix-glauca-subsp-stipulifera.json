    "intro": "Salix glauca subsp. stipulifera, commonly known as the stipulate willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and grayish bark. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a bluish-green underside, and they have distinctive stipules at the base. It produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. This subspecies is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
