    "intro": "Smelowskia alba, commonly known as the white smelowskia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white flowers with yellow centers, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Smelowskia alba is known for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in local herbal remedies."
