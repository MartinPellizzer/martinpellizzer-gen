    "intro": "Sonchus spicatus, commonly known as spiked sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and alternate, broadly lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, spiky inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
