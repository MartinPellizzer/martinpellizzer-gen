    "intro": "Stenosiphon virgatum, commonly known as the narrow-sheath grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive sheathing base, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a compact cluster. Stenosiphon virgatum is typically found in grassland habitats and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
