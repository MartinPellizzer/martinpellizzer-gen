    "intro": "Solanum cicatricosum, commonly known as the scarred nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its distinctive scarred leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. Its fruits are berries that mature to a deep purple color, and they are often used in traditional medicine. However, like many members of the nightshade family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
