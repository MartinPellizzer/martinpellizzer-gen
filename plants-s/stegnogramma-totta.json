It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous roots that anchor it to its substrate. Stegnogramma totta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
