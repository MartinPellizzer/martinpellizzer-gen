    "intro": "Stelis praemorsa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stelis praemorsa is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
