    "intro": "Sideritis condensata var. procumbens, commonly known as creeping ironweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and woodland edges. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it of interest in traditional herbal practices."
