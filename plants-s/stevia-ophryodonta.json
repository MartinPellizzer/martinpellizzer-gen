It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high levels of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in various food products. Stevia ophryodonta is often cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and medicinal value."
