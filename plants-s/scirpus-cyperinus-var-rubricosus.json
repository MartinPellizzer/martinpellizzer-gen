It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, fibrous stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering spikes are usually reddish-brown, giving it its common name. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and improve water quality."
