    "intro": "Sulcorebutia lepida, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular stem with a grayish-green color and is covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal watering. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
