    "intro": "Stylosanthes juncea f. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stylosanthes, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop in dryland agriculture. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia enhances soil fertility. The variety intermedia is often used in pasture systems due to its drought tolerance and nutritional value for livestock."
