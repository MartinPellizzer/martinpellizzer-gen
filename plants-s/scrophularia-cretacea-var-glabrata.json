It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal cliffs. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
