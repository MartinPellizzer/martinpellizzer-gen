    "intro": "Solanum occidentale, commonly known as the western nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
