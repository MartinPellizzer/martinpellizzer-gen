    "intro": "Salsola dioica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is an annual or biennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has succulent, spiny stems and leaves that are usually covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Salsola dioica is adapted to harsh environments and is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
