    "intro": "Smilacina stellata, commonly known as star-twining vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern North America. It features slender, wiry stems that twine around supports and can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Smilacina stellata is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
