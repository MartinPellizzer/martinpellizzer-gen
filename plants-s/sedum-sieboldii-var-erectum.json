It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
