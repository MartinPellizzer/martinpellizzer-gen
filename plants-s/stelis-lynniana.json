    "intro": "Stelis lynniana, commonly known as the Lynn's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil. Stelis lynniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
