    "intro": "Salix secta, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found along streams, wetlands, and other moist habitats. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. The bark of Salix secta is generally smooth and may have a reddish or grayish hue, depending on the age of the plant."
