    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor, commonly known as millet, is a tall, drought-resistant grass native to Africa. It produces edible grains that are rich in carbohydrates and protein, making it an important staple crop in many regions. The plant's inflorescence consists of spikelets that contain the seeds, which are harvested for food, animal feed, and biofuel. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure. Sorghum bicolor is also valued for its adaptability to a wide range of climates and soils."
