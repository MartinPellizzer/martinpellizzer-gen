    "intro": "Sclerochloa arenaria var. maritima, commonly known as maritime sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastlines."
