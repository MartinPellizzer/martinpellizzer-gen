    "intro": "Stevia bicrenata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are the primary part used, either fresh or dried, for their intense sweetness. Stevia bicrenata is valued for its low-calorie sweetening properties and is widely used in herbal remedies and as a sugar substitute."
