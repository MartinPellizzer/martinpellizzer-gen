    "intro": "Sagittaria guianensis, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, aiding in photosynthesis. Its flowering stems produce small, white or greenish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Sagittaria guianensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
