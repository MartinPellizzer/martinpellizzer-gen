    "intro": "Sciuris simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved sciuris, is a unique plant characterized by its simple, elongated leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It belongs to the family Sciuridaceae, which is primarily composed of shrubs and small trees. The plant exhibits a woody stem with a rough, bark-like surface, and its leaves are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. Sciuris simplicifolia is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
