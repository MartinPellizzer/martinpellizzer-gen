It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically fleshy, thick, and often covered with a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to withstand dry conditions."
