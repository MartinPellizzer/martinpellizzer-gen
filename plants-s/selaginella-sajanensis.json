    "intro": "Selaginella sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in specialized structures called strobila. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary history as a member of the lycophytes, a group that diverged from other vascular plants over 300 million years ago. Selaginella sajanensis is of interest to botanists due to its potential role in understanding plant adaptation and conservation in fragile ecosystems."
