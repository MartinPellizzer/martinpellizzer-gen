    "intro": "Stanhopea tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima stanhopea, is a rare orchid species native to Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests of its native range. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, supporting its epiphytic growth habit. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stanhopea tolimensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
