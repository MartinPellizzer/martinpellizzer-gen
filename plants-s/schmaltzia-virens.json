    "intro": "Schmaltzia virens, commonly known as the green sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in the summer months. Schmaltzia virens thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or high mountain habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor conditions."
