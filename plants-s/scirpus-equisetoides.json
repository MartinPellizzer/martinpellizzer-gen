    "intro": "Scirpus equisetoides, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers at the top of the stem, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it thrive in moist or aquatic environments. Scirpus equisetoides plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
