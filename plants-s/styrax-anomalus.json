    "intro": "Styrax anomalus, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. Styrax anomalus prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
