    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves, which give it a unique appearance. This cultivar is primarily grown for ornamental purposes rather than as a food crop. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares the same basic growth habits as other potato varieties. Its tubers, while edible, are typically smaller and less productive compared to standard potato cultivars."
