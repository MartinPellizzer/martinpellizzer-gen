It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
