    "intro": "Sabina recurva var. coxii, commonly known as the Mexican juniper or Coxi's juniper, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces blue-gray berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in dry climates."
