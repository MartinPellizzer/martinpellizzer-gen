    "intro": "Sempervivum molle, commonly known as the woolly houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy rosettes of leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or containers. Sempervivum molle is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
