    "intro": "Senecio ampullaceus var. floccosus, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
