    "intro": "Saurauia alvarezii, commonly known as the Alvarez's everlet, is a rare shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Saurauia alvarezii is notable for its unique leaf morphology, with thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
