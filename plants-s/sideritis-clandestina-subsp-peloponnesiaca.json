    "intro": "Sideritis clandestina subsp. peloponnesiaca, commonly known as the Peloponnesian ironwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. It grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
