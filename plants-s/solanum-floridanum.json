    "intro": "Solanum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and typically grows in wetland habitats. The plant produces small, purple to white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it bears berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum floridanum is often considered a weed but has ecological significance in its native environment."
