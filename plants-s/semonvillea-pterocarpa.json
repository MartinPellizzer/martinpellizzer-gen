    "intro": "Semonvillea pterocarpa, commonly known as the horned screw pine, is a unique tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a spiral-shaped appearance. The plant has a fibrous, woody structure with a thick, fleshy trunk that stores water, adapting to its arid environment. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or green, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Semonvillea pterocarpa is often found growing near coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role."
