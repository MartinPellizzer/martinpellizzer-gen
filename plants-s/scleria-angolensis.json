    "intro": "Scleria angolensis, commonly known as the Angola sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Scleria angolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
