    "intro": "Spiraeanthemum collinum, commonly known as the mountain spirea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has elliptical leaves with finely serrated edges and a compact, rounded form. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
