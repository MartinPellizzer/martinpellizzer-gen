    "intro": "Sesamopteris alata, commonly known as the winged water fern, is a member of the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four parts, with the lateral lobes often having a distinct wing-like structure. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, and thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Sesamopteris alata is also used in traditional medicine and as a water purifier in some cultures."
