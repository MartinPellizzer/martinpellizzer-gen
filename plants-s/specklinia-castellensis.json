    "intro": "Specklinia castellensis, commonly known as the Castell's polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Specklinia castellensis is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical rainforests."
