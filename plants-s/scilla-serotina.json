    "intro": "Scilla serotina, commonly known as late scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. Scilla serotina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in gardens."
