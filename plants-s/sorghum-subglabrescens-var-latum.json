    "intro": "Sorghum subglabrescens var. latum, commonly known as the broad-leaved sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for marginal agricultural lands. Its growth habit and morphology make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential for forage or biofuel production. The variety latum is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to other varieties within the species."
