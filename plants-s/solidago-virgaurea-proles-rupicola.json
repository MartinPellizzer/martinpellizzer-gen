    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea proles rupicola, commonly known as the rock goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicles and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to poor, well-drained soils makes it a hardy species often found in mountainous regions. The plant's resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ecological restoration projects."
