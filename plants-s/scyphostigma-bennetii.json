    "intro": "Scyphostigma bennetii, commonly known as the Bennett's ghost flower, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often colorful bracts that resemble small flowers, which are actually modified leaves. These bracts can range in color from deep red to orange and are used in traditional medicine by local communities. Scyphostigma bennetii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforests."
