    "intro": "Syzygium revolutum subsp. cyclophyllum, commonly known as the round-leaf tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
