    "intro": "Stellaria ebracteata, commonly known as the starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has narrow, lanceolate leaves arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Stellaria ebracteata is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
