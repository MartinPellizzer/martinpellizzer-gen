    "intro": "Solanum skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at high altitudes. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum skutchii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
