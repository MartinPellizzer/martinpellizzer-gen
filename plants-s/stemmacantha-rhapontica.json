    "intro": "Stemmacantha rhapontica, commonly known as the Russian knapweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eurasia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branched towards the top. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
