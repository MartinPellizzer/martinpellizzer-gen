    "intro": "Soliva pedicellata, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Soliva pedicellata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
