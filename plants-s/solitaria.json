    "intro": "Solitaria, commonly known as the solitary bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of down, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. Solitaria thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
