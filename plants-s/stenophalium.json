It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The plants typically have showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds. Stenophalium species are often shrubs or small trees, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs.
