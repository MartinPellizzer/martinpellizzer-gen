    "intro": "Smilax panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian greenbriar, is a climbing shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny foliage, which help it to cling to trees and other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. Smilax panamensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
