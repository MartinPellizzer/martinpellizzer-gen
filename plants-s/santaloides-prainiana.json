    "intro": "Santaloides prainiana, commonly known as the Prain's sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a slender, woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in association with other plants. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from host plants, while it also performs photosynthesis."
