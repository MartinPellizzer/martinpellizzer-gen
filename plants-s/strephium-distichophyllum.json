    "intro": "Strephium distichophyllum, commonly known as the two-ranked strephium, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique foliage, with leaves arranged in two vertical rows along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical species from further decline."
