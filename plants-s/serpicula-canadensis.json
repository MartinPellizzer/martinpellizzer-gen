    "intro": "Serpicula canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian serpyllium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. Serpicula canadensis is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with high moisture content."
