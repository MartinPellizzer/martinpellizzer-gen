    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, needle-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are borne on the upper parts of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
