    "intro": "Strychnos brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved strychnos, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and rocky areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
