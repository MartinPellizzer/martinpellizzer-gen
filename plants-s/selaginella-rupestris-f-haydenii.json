It is a vascular plant characterized by its upright, spiky stems and small, scale-like leaves. Native to specific regions of the southwestern United States, it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing microspores and megaspores on separate structures. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
