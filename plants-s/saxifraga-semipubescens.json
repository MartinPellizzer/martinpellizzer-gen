    "intro": "Saxifraga semipubescens, commonly known as the pubescent saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga semipubescens is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to the alpine flora."
