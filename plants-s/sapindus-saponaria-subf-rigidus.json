    "intro": "Sapindus saponaria subf. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid soapberry, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 11 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. Its fruit is notable for containing a foamy latex, which has been traditionally used for cleaning purposes. The rigid form of the plant is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other subspecies."
