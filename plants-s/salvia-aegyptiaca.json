    "intro": "Salvia aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with pairs of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flower spikes in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a popular choice in both gardens and traditional herbal practices."
