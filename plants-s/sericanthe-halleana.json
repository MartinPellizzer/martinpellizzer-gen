    "intro": "Sericanthe halleana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sericanthe halleana is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
