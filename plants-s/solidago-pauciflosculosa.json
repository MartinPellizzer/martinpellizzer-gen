It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
