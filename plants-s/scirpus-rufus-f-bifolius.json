    "intro": "Scirpus rufus f. bifolius, commonly known as the red sedge with two leaves, is a variant of the red sedge species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive two-leaf morphology, which differentiates it from the typical three-leaf structure of the species. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish in color, especially at the base. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator plant for wetland ecosystems and its use in ecological restoration projects."
