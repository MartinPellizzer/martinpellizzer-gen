    "intro": "Solanum aureitomentosum, commonly known as the golden-haired nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
