It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and opposite, simple, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
