    "intro": "Silene pilosa, commonly known as the hairy catchfly, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Silene pilosa thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is a perennial species that plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
