    "intro": "Sium medium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a distinctive, branched stem that grows up to 1 meter tall, often with a hairy texture. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of theApiaceae family. The roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine and as a food source by some indigenous communities."
