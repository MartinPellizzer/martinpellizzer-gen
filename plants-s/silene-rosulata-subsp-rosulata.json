    "intro": "Silene rosulata subsp. rosulata, commonly known as the rosette campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces striking clusters of pink to red flowers in late summer, which are borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and specialized plant collections."
