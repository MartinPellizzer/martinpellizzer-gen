It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in moist, open habitats. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Sida triquetra is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
