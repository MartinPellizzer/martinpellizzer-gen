    "intro": "Stachys veronicifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. Stachys veronicifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
