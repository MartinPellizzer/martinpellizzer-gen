    "intro": "Semecarpus ngoyensis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and East Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
