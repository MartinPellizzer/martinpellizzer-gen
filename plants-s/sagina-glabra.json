    "intro": "Sagina glabra, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Its simple, prostrate growth habit allows it to spread efficiently across the ground. Sagina glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
