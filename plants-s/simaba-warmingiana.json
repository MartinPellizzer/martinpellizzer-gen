    "intro": "Simaba warmingiana, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic reasons."
