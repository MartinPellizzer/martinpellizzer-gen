    "intro": "Smelowskia alba var. tilingii, commonly known as the Tilingii snowbell, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its elegant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with smooth, gray-green foliage. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
