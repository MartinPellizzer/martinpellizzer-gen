    "intro": "Stellaria heterantha, commonly known as the white-stemmed starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Eurasia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Stellaria heterantha is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
