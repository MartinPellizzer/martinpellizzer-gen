    "intro": "Scirpus racemosus, commonly known as the common tussock sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, three-lobed flowers in spikelets. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Scirpus racemosus is also valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for waterfowl."
