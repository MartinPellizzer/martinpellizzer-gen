    "intro": "Sinapis alba subsp. alba, commonly known as white mustard, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and lobed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. White mustard is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed due to its ability to spread quickly."
