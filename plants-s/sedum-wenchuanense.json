    "intro": "Sedum wenchuanense, commonly known as the Wenchuan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to China. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Sedum wenchuanense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water landscapes."
