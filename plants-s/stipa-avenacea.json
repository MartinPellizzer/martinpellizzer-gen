It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Stipa avenacea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
