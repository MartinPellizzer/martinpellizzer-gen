    "intro": "Stevia pyrolifolia, commonly known as the Mexican stevia, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Stevia pyrolifolia is known for its sweet taste, similar to other stevia species, and has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
