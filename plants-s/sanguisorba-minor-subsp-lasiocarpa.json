    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor subsp. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly sanguisorbe, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Arctic. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
