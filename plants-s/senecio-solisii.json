It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, displaying vibrant yellow blooms. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio solisii is popular in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
