    "intro": "Scilla bifolia var. drunensis, commonly known as the Drunensk scilla, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
