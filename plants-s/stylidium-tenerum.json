    "intro": "Stylidium tenerum, commonly known as the slender triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive trigger-like structure on its flowers, which aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Its small, tubular flowers are usually bright red or orange, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Stylidium tenerum is a herbaceous perennial that produces a basal rosette of leaves and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
