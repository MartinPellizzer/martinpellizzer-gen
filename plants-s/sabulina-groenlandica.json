    "intro": "Sabulina groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a shallow root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Sabulina groenlandica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an important part of the local flora."
