    "intro": "Scutellaria sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in whorls along the stem, and the plant has a compact, low-growing habit. Scutellaria sciaphila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
