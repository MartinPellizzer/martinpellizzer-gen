    "intro": "Scleropoa divaricata, commonly known as the variable grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rigid, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Scleropoa divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and distinctive appearance."
