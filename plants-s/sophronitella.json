    "intro": "Sophronitella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Sophronitella is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
