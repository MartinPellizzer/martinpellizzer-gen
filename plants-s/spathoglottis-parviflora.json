    "intro": "Spathoglottis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ginger orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Spathoglottis parviflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
