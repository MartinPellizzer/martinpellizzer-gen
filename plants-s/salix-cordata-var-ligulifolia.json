    "intro": "Salix cordata var. ligulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its growth habit and foliage make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
