It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
