It is characterized by its distinctive, club-like inflorescences that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to saline and windy conditions. Its flowers are small and blue or purple in color, often appearing in clusters. Sacciolepis claviformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
