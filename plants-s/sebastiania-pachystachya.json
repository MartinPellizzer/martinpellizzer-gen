    "intro": "Sebastiania pachystachya, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, clustered purple berries that persist through the winter, making it a visually appealing plant in ornamental gardens. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by the distinctive berries. Sebastiania pachystachya is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
