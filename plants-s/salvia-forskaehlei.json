    "intro": "[WRONG START] Salvia forskahlei, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow gray-green leaves, and striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological landscaping. Salvia forskahlei also serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
