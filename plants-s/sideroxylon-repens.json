    "intro": "Sideroxylon repens, commonly known as the creeping ironwood, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems that grow close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Sideroxylon repens is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its hard, durable wood."
