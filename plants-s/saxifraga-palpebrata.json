    "intro": "Saxifraga palpebrata, commonly known as the eyelash saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga palpebrata is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
