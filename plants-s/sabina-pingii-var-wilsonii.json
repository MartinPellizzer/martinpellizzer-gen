It features needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that are reddish-brown when mature. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The variety is prized for its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
