    "intro": "Swartzia mayana, commonly known as the red cedar or yellow wood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are alternate and pinnate. Swartzia mayana is valued for its hard, durable timber and is often used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
