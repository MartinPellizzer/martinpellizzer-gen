    "intro": "Sonchus daltonii, commonly known as Dalton's sow thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spiny, hairy seeds. Dalton's sow thistle is often considered a weed but has potential for use in ecological restoration due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
