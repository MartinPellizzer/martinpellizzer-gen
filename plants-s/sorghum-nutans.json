    "intro": "Sorghum nutans, commonly known as the nodding sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its drooping inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces small, dry fruits called caryopses. Sorghum nutans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local communities."
