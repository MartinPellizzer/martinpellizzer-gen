    "intro": "Statice mucronata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of maritime conditions, including wind and salt spray. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Statice mucronata is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
