    "intro": "Sphaeropteris auriculifera, commonly known as the auriculate cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that are often adorned with distinctive ear-shaped lobes. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of its cycad classification. Its growth habit is slow, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
