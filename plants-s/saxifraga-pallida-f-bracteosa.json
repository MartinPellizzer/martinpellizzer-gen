    "intro": "Saxifraga pallida f. bracteosa, commonly known as the pale saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It features rosettes of pale green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings."
