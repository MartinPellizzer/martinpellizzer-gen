    "intro": "Stipa cazorlensis, commonly known as the Cazorla needlegrass, is a species of grass native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often found in areas with low rainfall. Stipa cazorlensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
