    "intro": "Scolymus giganteus, commonly known as giant scorzonera, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features large, lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. Its root system is notable for being thick and fleshy, which contributes to its common name. Scolymus giganteus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and long blooming period."
