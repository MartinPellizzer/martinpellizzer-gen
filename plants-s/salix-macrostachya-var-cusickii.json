    "intro": "Salix macrostachya var. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's willow, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, typically appearing in early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture. This willow thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
