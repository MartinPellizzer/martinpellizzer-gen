    "intro": "Scabiosa bailletii, commonly known as the alpine scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, aiding in water retention and protection from harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Scabiosa bailletii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
