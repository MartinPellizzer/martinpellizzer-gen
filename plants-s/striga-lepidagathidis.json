    "intro": "Striga lepidagathidis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant agricultural damage. It is native to Africa and has become a major weed in regions with warm climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it is difficult to control and poses a serious threat to food security in affected areas."
