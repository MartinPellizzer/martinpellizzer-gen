    "intro": "Salvia compar, commonly known as the narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Salvia compar is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
