    "intro": "Stipa tortilis, commonly known as the curly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and fine, needle-like leaves that curl inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Stipa tortilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
