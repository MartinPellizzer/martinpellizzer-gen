    "intro": "Salvia dolichantha, commonly known as the \"blue mistflower,\" is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in dense, mist-like clusters during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are hairy to the touch, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia dolichantha is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
