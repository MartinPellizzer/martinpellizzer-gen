    "intro": "Sarracenia leucophylla var. alba, commonly known as the white-tongued pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps, which secrete a digestive fluid to break down insects. The plant's white, waxy interior of the pitcher gives it its distinctive appearance, and it often has a red or purple coloration along the rim. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This variety is prized by growers for its ornamental value and unique predatory behavior."
