It typically grows in open, arid, or semi-arid environments, often found on rocky soils or in grasslands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle of spikelets, which are small and often tinged with purple or brown.
