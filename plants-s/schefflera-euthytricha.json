    "intro": "Schefflera euthytricha, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of palmate leaves, which are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by reddish-brown berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens. Schefflera euthytricha is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
