    "intro": "Solanum bicorne, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped calyx that encloses the fruit. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it produces small, oval berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some regions."
