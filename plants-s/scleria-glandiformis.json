It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and triangular leaves, typical of many sedges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, arranged in spikelets. Scleria glandiformis is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.
