    "intro": "Santolina squarrosa, commonly known as squarrosa santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and resistance to pests. Santolina squarrosa is also valued for its aromatic leaves and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
