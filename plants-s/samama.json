    "intro": "Samama, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant belonging to the Nymphaeaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water surface. Its leaves are broad, round, and often float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. The samama holds cultural and religious significance in many societies, especially in Hinduism and Buddhism."
