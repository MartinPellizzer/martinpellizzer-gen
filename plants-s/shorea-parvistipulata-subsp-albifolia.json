    "intro": "Shorea parvistipulata subsp. albifolia, commonly known as the white-leafed tamanu, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a medium to large evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses. The subspecies albifolia is distinguished by its distinctive white pubescence on the leaves, setting it apart from other Shorea species."
