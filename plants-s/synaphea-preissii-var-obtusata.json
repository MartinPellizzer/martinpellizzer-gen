    "intro": "Synaphea preissii var. obtusata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved synaphea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
