    "intro": "Sonchus friesii, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by spiky, bristly seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
