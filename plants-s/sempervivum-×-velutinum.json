    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 velutinum, commonly known as the velvet sedum, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating. The leaves are typically green to bluish-green, with a velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
