    "intro": "Sempervivum debile, commonly known as the common houseleek, is a low-growing succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its dense rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with reddish or purple hues under stress. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a houseplant."
