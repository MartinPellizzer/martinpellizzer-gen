    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or silver-gray pubescent leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
