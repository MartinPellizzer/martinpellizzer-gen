It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and small, catkin-like flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of drought conditions. Its root system helps stabilize loose soils, making it useful for erosion control. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining desert ecosystems."
