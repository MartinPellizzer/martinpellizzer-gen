    "intro": "Salvia lanuginosa, commonly known as wooly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, which gives it a woolly appearance. Salvia lanuginosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
