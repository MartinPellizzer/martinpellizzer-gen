    "intro": "Scribaea, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants typically grow in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their most distinctive feature is the large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are usually broad and floating, providing shade and oxygen to the water. Scribaea species are valued for their ornamental beauty and cultural significance in various traditions."
