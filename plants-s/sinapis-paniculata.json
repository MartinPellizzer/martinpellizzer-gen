    "intro": "Sinapis paniculata, commonly known as field mustard, is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils effectively. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and have a peppery taste, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Botanically, it belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants."
