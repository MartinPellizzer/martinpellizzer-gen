    "intro": "Scleropoa memphitica var. dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in disturbed areas. This variety is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
