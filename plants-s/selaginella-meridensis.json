    "intro": "Selaginella meridensis, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a dense rosette of needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged around its central axis. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microsporangia and megasporangia, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Selaginella meridensis is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems."
