    "intro": "Swida oblonga var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf swida, is a shrub native to specific regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native habitat."
