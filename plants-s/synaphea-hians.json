It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, upright clump. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thickets. Its fronds are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside, giving it a striking appearance. Synaphea hians thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
