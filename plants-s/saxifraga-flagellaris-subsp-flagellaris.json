    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris subsp. flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in tight, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it a characteristic component of alpine and tundra ecosystems."
