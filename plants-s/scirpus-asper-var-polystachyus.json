    "intro": "Scirpus asper var. polystachyus, commonly known as the stiff bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spiky flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lake margins, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland vegetation structure. The leaves are narrow, tough, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its \"asper\" designation."
