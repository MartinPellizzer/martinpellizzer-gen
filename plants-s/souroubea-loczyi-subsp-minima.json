    "intro": "Souroubea loczyi subsp. minima, commonly known as the dwarf souroubea, is a rare and small shrub native to the high altitudes of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
