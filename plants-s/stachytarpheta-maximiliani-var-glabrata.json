It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
