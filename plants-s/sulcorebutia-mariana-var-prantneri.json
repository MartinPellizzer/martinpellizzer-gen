    "intro": "Sulcorebutia mariana var. prantneri, commonly known as the Prantner's moon cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It features a swollen, rounded stem that often displays a variety of colors, including red, pink, and purple, due to its high concentration of pigments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its vibrant stem. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
