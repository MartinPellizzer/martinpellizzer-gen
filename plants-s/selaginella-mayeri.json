    "intro": "Selaginella mayeri, commonly known as the Hart's tongue fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This plant is a spore-bearing species, producing microspores and megaspores on separate structures called microsporophylls and megasporophylls. Selaginella mayeri is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
