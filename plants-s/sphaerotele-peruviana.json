    "intro": "Sphaerotele peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian globe cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is a low-growing cactus characterized by its globular stems and spiny, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climate gardens."
