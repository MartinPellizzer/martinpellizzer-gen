    "intro": "Sarcanthus bicuspidatus, commonly known as the two-pointed sarcanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with two distinct lobes on each petal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus bicuspidatus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
