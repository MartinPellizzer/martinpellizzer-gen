    "intro": "Stylocline filaginea, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats and can be a challenge to detect due to its lack of visible foliage. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions and is of interest to botanists studying plant symbiosis."
