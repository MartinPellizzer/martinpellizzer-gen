    "intro": "Schefflera jahnii, commonly known as the Jahn's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, clustered leaves that form a compact, umbrella-like shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera jahnii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
