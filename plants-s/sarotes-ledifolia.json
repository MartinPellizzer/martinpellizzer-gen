    "intro": "Sarotes ledifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with succulent leaves that help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact size and striking floral display."
