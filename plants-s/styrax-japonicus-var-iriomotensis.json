    "intro": "Styrax japonicus var. iriomotensis, commonly known as Iriomote styrax, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iriomote Island in Japan. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, glossy, dark purple berries. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a smooth texture, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
