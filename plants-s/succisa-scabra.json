It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. Succisa scabra is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
