    "intro": "Salix capitata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Salix capitata thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds."
