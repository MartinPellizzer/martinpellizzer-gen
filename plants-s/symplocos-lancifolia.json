    "intro": "Symplocos lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by bright blue berries that are a key feature of the species. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Symplocos lancifolia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
