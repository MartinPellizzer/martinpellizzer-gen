    "intro": "Salix fuscescens subsp. poronaica, commonly known as the Poronai willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with short, soft hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
