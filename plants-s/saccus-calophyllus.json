    "intro": "Saccus calophyllus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Saccus calophyllus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth. Its presence can sometimes indicate soil disturbance or environmental change."
