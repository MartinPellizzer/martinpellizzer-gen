It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
