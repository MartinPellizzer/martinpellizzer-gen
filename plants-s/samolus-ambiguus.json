    "intro": "Samolus ambiguus, commonly known as the water avens, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and moist soils in the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions. Samolus ambiguus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect life."
