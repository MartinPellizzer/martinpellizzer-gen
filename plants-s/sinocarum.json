    "intro": "Sinocarum, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Campanulaceae family. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, and includes several species that are often found in mountainous regions. The plants typically have showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sinocarum species are characterized by their upright growth habit and simple, lance-shaped leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
