    "intro": "Sophronitis mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
