    "intro": "Sonchus integrifolius, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, hairy, and lobed leaves, which are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, surrounded by pale green bracts. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, gardens, and along roadsides. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
