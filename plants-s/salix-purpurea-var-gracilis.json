    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, often boggy soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and lakes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
