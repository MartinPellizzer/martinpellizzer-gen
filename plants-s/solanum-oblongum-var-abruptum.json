    "intro": "Solanum oblongum var. abruptum, commonly known as the abrupt leaf nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, abruptly narrowing leaves and small, usually yellow or white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally not cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
