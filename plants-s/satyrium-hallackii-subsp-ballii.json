    "intro": "Satyrium hallackii subsp. ballii, commonly known as the Ball's ghost orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-white coloration. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested habitats. Its small, tubular flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
