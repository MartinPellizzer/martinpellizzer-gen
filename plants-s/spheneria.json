    "intro": "Spheneria, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, herbaceous plants belonging to the order Sphenophyta. These plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and spore-bearing cones, which are typically found on the stems. Spheneria species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. They have a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and are considered ancient plants. Despite their small size, they play an important role in soil stabilization and as habitat for various microorganisms."
