    "intro": "Saxifraga oregana var. typica, commonly known as the Pacific silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States and coastal regions of Canada. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal and maritime climates."
