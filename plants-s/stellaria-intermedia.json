    "intro": "Stellaria intermedia, commonly known as common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white star-shaped flowers with five petals, which give it its common name. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Stellaria intermedia is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
