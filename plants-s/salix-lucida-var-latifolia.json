    "intro": "Salix lucida var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. Its flowers are catkins, which are grouped in clusters and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
