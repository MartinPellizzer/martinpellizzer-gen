    "intro": "Strigosella hyrcanica, commonly known as the Hyrcanian strigosella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Caucasus region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, typically in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
