    "intro": "Stenoptera valida, commonly known as the golden feather fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that resemble feathers, with a yellowish-green hue. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Stenoptera valida prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical rainforests."
