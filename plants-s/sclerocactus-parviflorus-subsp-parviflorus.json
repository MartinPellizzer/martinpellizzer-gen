    "intro": "Sclerocactus parviflorus subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered stonecactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globose cactus with a ribbed, cylindrical stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the apex of the stem. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
