    "intro": "Scleria natalensis, commonly known as Natal marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its three-ranked leaves and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spikelets, and are pollinated by wind."
