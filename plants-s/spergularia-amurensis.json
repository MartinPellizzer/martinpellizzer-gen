    "intro": "Spergularia amurensis, commonly known as Amur sandwort, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly found in regions of Russia, China, and Korea. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Spergularia amurensis is known for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
