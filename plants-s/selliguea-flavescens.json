    "intro": "Selliguea flavescens, commonly known as the yellow hepatic, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Its bright yellow color comes from the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments in its cells. Selliguea flavescens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
