    "intro": "Salix libanii, commonly known as the Lebanon willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has small, elliptical leaves that are usually gray-green in color. It is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. The Lebanon willow plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
