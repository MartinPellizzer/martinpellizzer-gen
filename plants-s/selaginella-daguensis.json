    "intro": "Selaginella daguensis, commonly known as the Daguena spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobilae, which are cone-like structures containing spores, typical of its reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages."
