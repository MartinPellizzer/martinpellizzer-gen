It features upright, branched stems with opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
