    "intro": "Sorghastrum apalachicolense, commonly known as the Apalachicola grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often found along the Apalachicola River and other similar habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
