    "intro": "Saussurea sumneviczii, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rhizomes are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
