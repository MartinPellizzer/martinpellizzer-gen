    "intro": "Specklinia longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed speckled orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, speckled pattern, giving it its common name. Specklinia longicaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
