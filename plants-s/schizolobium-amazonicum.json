    "intro": "Schizolobium amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and plays a vital role in the ecological structure of the rainforest. Due to its slow growth and high value, it is also threatened by deforestation and overharvesting."
