    "intro": "Selaginella pennata, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, cone-like formations. Selaginella pennata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
