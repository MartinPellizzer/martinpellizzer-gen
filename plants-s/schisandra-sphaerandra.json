    "intro": "Schisandra sphaerandra, commonly known as the spherical schisandra, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a member of the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spherical fruit that resembles a small orange. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties, though it remains poorly studied due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
