    "intro": "Sorbus commixta var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. This species is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
