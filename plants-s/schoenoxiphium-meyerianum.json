    "intro": "Schoenoxiphium meyerianum, commonly known as the Meyer's goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its rugged appearance. Schoenoxiphium meyerianum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
