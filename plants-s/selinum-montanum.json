    "intro": "Selinum montanum, commonly known as mountain parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its aromatic leaves and stems contain compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine. Selinum montanum is also valued as a decorative plant due to its delicate appearance and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
