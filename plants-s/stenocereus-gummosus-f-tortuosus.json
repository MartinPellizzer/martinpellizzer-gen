It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often twisted or spiraled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.
