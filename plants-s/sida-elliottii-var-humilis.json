It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually oval with a hairy texture. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The species is often found in disturbed or saturated soils, making it a common indicator of wetland environments."
