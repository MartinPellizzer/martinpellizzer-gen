    "intro": "Silene donetzica subsp. sillingeri, commonly known as the Donets Basin catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
