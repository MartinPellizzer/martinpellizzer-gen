It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and rocky areas. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
