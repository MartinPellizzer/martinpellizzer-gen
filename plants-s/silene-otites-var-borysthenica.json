    "intro": "Silene otites var. borysthenica, commonly known as the Crimean catchfly, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of the Crimean Peninsula. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is adapted to sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a characteristic species of the region's dry grasslands. Silene otites var. borysthenica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
