    "intro": "Salix lanata subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and flexible, often pendulous branches. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
