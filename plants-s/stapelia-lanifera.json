    "intro": "Stapelia lanifera, commonly known as the woolly stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in soft, woolly hair, giving it a unique and somewhat fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom in late summer and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia lanifera is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
