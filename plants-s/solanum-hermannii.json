    "intro": "Solanum hermannii, commonly known as the Hermann's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, glandular hairs, and a preference for well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded environments. Solanum hermannii is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
