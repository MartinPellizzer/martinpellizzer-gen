    "intro": "Sempervivum marmoreum f. longirameum, commonly known as the Long-stemmed Rosy Alp, is a compact, evergreen succulent with a rosette-forming growth habit. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often adorned with red or pink hues, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact colonies."
