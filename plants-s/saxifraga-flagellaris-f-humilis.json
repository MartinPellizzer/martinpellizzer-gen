    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically clustered at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler regions."
