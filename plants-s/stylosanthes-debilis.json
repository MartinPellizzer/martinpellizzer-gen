    "intro": "Stylosanthes debilis, commonly known as smallleaf stylosanthes, is a tropical legume native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Stylosanthes debilis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and agricultural purposes. It also has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
