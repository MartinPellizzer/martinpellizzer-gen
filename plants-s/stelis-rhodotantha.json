    "intro": "Stelis rhodotantha, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks, and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive red or pinkish hue on the stems. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining substrates, making it a popular choice for terrariums and hanging gardens. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is appreciated by both novice and experienced orchid growers."
