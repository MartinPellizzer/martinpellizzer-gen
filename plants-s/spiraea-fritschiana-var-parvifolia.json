It is characterized by its delicate, arching branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a fine texture and a bluish-green hue, providing an attractive contrast to the flowers. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
