It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with branched stems and small, green leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
