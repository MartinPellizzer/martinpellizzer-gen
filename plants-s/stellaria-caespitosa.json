    "intro": "Stellaria caespitosa, commonly known as mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common indicator species in moist, temperate habitats."
