    "intro": "[WRONG START] S tegia trimestris var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed three-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the end of its short stem. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stem compared to the typical form of *S. trimestris*."
