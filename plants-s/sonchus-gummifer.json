It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and basal rosettes of broadly lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is known for its milky latex sap, which is a distinguishing feature. Sonchus gummifer is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments."
