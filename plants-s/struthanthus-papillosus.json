    "intro": "Struthanthus papillosus, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Struthanthus papillosus is known for its nocturnal blooming habit, attracting night-flying pollinators such as moths."
