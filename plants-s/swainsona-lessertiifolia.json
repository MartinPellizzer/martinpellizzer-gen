    "intro": "Swainsona lessertiifolia, commonly known as the lesser leaf swainsona, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Swainsona lessertiifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
