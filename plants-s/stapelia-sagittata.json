    "intro": "Stapelia sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, fleshy, leaf-like structure that resembles a sword, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's unique morphology and adaptive features make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
