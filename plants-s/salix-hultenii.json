    "intro": "Salix hultenii, commonly known as Hult\u00e9n's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Salix hultenii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
