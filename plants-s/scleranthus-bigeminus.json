    "intro": "Scleranthus bigeminus, commonly known as the twin-seeded sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the plant has a short, upright stem."
