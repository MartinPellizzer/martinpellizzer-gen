    "intro": "Sonneratia \u00d7 urama, commonly known as the mangrove hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Sonneratia alba and Sonneratia ovata. It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along tropical coastlines. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species."
