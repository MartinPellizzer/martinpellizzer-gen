    "intro": "Sorghum schirense, commonly known as the red sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or purple-colored stems and leaves, which are often used in traditional crafts and as ornamental plants. The plant thrives in warm climates and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its fibrous stalks can be processed into textiles or used as a source of biofuel. Additionally, it plays a role in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
