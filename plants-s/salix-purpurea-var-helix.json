    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. helix, commonly known as the purple willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are bright green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental planting and erosion control."
