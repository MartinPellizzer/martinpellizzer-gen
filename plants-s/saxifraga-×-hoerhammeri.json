    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 hoerhammeri, commonly known as the Hoerhammer's saxifrage, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, often clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
