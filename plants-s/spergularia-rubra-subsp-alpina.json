    "intro": "Spergularia rubra subsp. alpina, commonly known as alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, pink or red flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra. Its growth habit is mat-forming, allowing it to spread and stabilize soil in unstable environments. The plant plays a role in providing habitat and food for various alpine invertebrates and small mammals."
