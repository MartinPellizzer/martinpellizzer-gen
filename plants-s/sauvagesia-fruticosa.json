    "intro": "Sauvagesia fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
