    "intro": "Saxifraga mutabilis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant features rosettes of dark green, woolly leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a compact growth habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
