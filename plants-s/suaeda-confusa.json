    "intro": "Suaeda confusa, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Suaeda confusa plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
