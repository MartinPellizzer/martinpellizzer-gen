    "intro": "Scilla cupaniana, commonly known as the purple scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Scilla cupaniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
