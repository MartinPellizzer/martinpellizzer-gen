    "intro": "Stelis monetaria, commonly known as the money orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, clustered leaves that are often dark green and glossy. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators. Stelis monetaria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
