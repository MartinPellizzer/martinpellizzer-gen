    "intro": "Saussurea zeaeensis, commonly known as the Tibetan yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its flowers are usually visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
