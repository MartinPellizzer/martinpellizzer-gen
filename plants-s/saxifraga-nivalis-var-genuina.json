    "intro": "Saxifraga nivalis var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to grow."
