    "intro": "Sorocea sprucei subsp. subumbellata, commonly known as the dwarf sorocea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool and moist environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in dense rosettes. Its flowers are clustered in umbellate inflorescences, featuring pale blue to violet petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
