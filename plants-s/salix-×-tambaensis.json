It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Salix \u00d7 tambaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
