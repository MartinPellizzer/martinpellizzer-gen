    "intro": "Saxifraga columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Saxifraga columbiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
