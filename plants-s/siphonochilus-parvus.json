    "intro": "Siphonochilus parvus, commonly known as the small-leaf siphonochilus, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires high air humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
