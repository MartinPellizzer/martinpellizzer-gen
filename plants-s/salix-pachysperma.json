    "intro": "Salix pachysperma, commonly known as the thick-seeded willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a rough texture and a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
