    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
