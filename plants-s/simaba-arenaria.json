    "intro": "Simaba arenaria, commonly known as the beach simaba, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and high wind exposure. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its fragrant white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Simaba arenaria is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
