    "intro": "Struthiopteris spicant var. crenata, commonly known as the serrated field shield fern, is a variant of the field shield fern native to North America. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, triangular, and serrated fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, shield-like pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
