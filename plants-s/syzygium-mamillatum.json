    "intro": "Syzygium mamillatum, commonly known as the white corymbia, is a tropical rainforest tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces edible, red, fleshy berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental value. Syzygium mamillatum plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
