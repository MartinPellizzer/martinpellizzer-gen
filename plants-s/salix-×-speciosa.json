    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 speciosa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, papery leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and riparian restoration projects."
