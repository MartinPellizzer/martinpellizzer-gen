    "intro": "Solidago lepida var. salebrosa, commonly known as the slender goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. This variant is distinguished by its more slender growth habit compared to other goldenrod species."
