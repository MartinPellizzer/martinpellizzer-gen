It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. This plant thrives in coastal areas with high salinity, showcasing remarkable tolerance to salt stress. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are typically clustered at the tips of its branching stems. Selaginella salinoi plays a crucial ecological role in stabilizing salt marsh soils and supporting local biodiversity."
