It is characterized by its slender, often aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, with long, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its root system is fibrous and can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Stenosemia waterlotii is often found in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in other moist habitats."
