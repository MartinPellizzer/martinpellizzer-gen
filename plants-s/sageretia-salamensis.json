    "intro": "Sageretia salamensis, commonly known as the Salam's sageretia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Sageretia salamensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
