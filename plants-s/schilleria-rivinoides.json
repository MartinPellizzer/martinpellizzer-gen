    "intro": "Schilleria rivinoides, commonly known as the river schilleria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in South America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are often submerged or floating in shallow water. Schilleria rivinoides plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
