    "intro": "Salix japonica subf. fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and long, narrow leaves that are typically a bright green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
