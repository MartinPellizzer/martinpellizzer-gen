    "intro": "Scirpus olneyi f. australis, commonly known as the Australian bulrush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in regions with high moisture levels."
