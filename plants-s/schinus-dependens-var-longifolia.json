    "intro": "Schinus dependens var. longifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or \"pau-d'arco,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing as a shrub or small tree. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
