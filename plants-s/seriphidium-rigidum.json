    "intro": "Seriphidium rigidum, commonly known as rigid wormwood, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are rigid and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, dry fruits."
