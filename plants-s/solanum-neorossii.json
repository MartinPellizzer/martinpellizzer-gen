    "intro": "Solanum neorossii, commonly known as the Neorossii nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing numerous seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
