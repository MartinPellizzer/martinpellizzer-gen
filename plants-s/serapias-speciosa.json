    "intro": "Serapias speciosa, commonly known as the showy orchid or the red orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from orange to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Serapias speciosa is known for its unique floral structure, which includes a long, narrow spur that stores nectar to attract pollinators."
