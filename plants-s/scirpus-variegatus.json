It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often display a striking variegation of green and white or yellow. This species typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters near the top of the stems. Scirpus variegatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
