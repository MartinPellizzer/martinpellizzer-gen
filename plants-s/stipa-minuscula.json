    "intro": "Stipa minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a small perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its low profile and hardy nature, it is an important component of high-altitude vegetation."
