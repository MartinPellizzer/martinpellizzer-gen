    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. pyramidata, commonly known as the European elderberry tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, pyramidal shape, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces clusters of small, white or greenish flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high concentration of antioxidants. The leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
