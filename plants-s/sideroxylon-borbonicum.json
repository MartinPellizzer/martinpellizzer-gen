    "intro": "Sideroxylon borbonicum, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in dry forest and thorn scrub habitats, often reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds."
