    "intro": "Sanguisorba vulgaris var. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough sanguisorba, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, especially along the veins. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered with a fine layer of pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in moist garden soils for its ability to thrive in partial shade."
