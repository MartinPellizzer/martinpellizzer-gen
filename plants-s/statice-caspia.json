    "intro": "Statice caspia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Statice caspia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
