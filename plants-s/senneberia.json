    "intro": "Senneberia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Senneberia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures. Its ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it an important plant in dryland ecosystems."
