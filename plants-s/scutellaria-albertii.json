It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scutellaria albertii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value and medicinal potential have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
