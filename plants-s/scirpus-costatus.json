    "intro": "Scirpus costatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant has broad, flat, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. Its flowering spikes consist of small, clustered brownish flowers that appear in late summer to early fall. Scirpus costatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland wildlife."
