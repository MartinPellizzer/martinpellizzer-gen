    "intro": "Spergula arvensis subsp. nana, commonly known as dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense cushions of foliage close to the ground, with small, rounded leaves and white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid environments."
