    "intro": "Senegalia russelliana, commonly known as Russell's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry climates, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Senegalia russelliana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and as a forage plant."
