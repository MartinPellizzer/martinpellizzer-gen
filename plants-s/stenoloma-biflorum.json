    "intro": "Stenoloma biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered stenoloma, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, producing tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Stenoloma biflorum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
