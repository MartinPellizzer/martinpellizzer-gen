    "intro": "Sagina \u00d7 micrantha, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, prostrate stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
