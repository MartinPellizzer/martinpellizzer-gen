    "intro": "Solanum stellativelutinum, commonly known as the star-like yellow nightshade, is a unique species within the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, orange-red berry. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution."
