    "intro": "Sedum farronianum, commonly known as the Farroan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun. Sedum farronianum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
