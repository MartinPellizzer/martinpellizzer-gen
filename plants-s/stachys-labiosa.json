    "intro": "Stachys labiosa, commonly known as the pink mint or sticky leaved hedge nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stachys labiosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
