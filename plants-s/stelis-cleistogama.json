    "intro": "Stelis cleistogama, commonly known as the closed flower orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically closed at the time of pollination. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Stelis cleistogama relies on specific pollinators, such as certain flies, due to its unique reproductive strategy."
