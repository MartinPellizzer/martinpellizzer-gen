    "intro": "Setaria tenax var. antrorsa, commonly known as black dropsettle, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black bracts that are tightly wrapped around the inflorescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
