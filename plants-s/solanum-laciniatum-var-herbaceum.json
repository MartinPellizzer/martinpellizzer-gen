It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant bears edible berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
