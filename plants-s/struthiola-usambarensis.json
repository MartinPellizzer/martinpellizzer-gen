    "intro": "Struthiola usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara starling or Usambara starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, dark fruits that are dispersed by birds. Struthiola usambarensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
