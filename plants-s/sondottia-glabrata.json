    "intro": "Sondottia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Sondottia glabrata is often found in coastal and inland dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
