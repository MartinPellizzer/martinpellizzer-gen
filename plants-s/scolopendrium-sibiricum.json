    "intro": "Scolopendrium sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the colder regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically located at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Scolopendrium sibiricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or acidic soils."
