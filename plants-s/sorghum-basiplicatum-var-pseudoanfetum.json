It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, hard grains that are rich in carbohydrates and protein. It thrives in poor soil conditions and is often used as a staple food crop in arid regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for both agricultural and ecological studies."
