    "intro": "Saussurea saxosa, commonly known as the saxifrage saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears yellow to brown composite flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saussurea saxosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
