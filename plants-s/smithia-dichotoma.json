    "intro": "Smithia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked broom, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems that often branch at the base, forming a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stems. Smithia dichotoma is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
