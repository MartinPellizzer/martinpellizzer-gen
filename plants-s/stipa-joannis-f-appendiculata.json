    "intro": "Stipa joannis f. appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that resembles a feather. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically borne on long, arching stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in arid or rocky gardens."
