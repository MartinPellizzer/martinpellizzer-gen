    "intro": "Schoenus melanostachys var. laevinux, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed flax sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
