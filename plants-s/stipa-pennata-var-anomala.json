    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. anomala, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, arching culms that often form dense clumps. The plant produces feathery inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for dry, rocky landscapes. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular selection for native plant gardens and erosion control."
