    "intro": "Scilla carnea, commonly known as the pink scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a bluish tinge. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with clusters of flowers emerging from grassy meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Scilla carnea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
