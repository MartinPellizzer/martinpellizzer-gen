    "intro": "Salsola palaestinica, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. After flowering, it develops into a dry, wind-dispersed fruit that allows the plant to spread across vast areas. Salsola palaestinica is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
