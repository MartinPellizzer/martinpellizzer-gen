    "intro": "Stevia diversipapposa f. exaristata, commonly known as the exaristate stevia, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the stevia genus. It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. This plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. It is valued for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, making it a potential natural sweetener. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it remains a subject of botanical interest and conservation efforts."
