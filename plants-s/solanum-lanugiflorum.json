It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by berries that range in color from green to red. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Solanum lanugiflorum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
