    "intro": "Symphytum cordifolium, commonly known as heart-leaved comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall spikes of purple or blue flowers in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
