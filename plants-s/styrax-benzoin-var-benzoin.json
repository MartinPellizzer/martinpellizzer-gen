    "intro": "Styrax benzoin var. benzoin, commonly known as benzoin, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a resinous gum, known as benzoin, which is exuded from the bark and twigs. This resin has been historically used in incense, perfumes, and traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both horticulture and pharmaceutical applications."
