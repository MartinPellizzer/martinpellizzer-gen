    "intro": "Struthiola recta, commonly known as the straight-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Struthiola recta is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
