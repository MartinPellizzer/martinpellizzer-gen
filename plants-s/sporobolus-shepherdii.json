    "intro": "Sporobolus shepherdii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry foliage and produces small, pale blue to purple flower heads. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its spread across open landscapes. Sporobolus shepherdii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
