    "intro": "Selinum libanotis, commonly known as the Lebanon garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, garlic-like scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or mountainous areas. Selinum libanotis is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
