    "intro": "Scaphosepalum zieglerae, commonly known as the Ziegler's scaphosepalum, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, spurred petals and a distinctive, hood-like labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understorey of forests. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scaphosepalum zieglerae is considered a species of conservation concern."
