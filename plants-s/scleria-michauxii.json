    "intro": "Scleria michauxii, commonly known as Michaux's spikeroot, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, woodland habitats. Scleria michauxii is often found in shaded areas along stream banks and in wetlands."
