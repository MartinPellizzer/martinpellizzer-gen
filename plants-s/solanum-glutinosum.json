    "intro": "Solanum glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which often emit a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption and is more often found in wild or cultivated settings as an ornamental or weed."
