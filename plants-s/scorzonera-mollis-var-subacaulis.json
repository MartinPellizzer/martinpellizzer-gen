    "intro": "Scorzonera mollis var. subacaulis, commonly known as the slender scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a slender, often leafless stem that rises from a short, tuberous rootstock. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a central disk. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
