    "intro": "Setaria viridis var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese green millet, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
