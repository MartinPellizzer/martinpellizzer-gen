    "intro": "Stylosanthes bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release small, rounded seeds. Stylosanthes bojeri is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is often used in forage and soil conservation in arid and semi-arid environments."
