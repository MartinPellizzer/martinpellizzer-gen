    "intro": "Symplocos glomerata subsp. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are a striking feature, often appearing in late summer. These berries are edible for some bird species but are generally considered toxic to humans. The shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
