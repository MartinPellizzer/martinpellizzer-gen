    "intro": "Striga asiatica var. coccinea, commonly known as the red witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that primarily infests the roots of cereal crops such as maize. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, reddish-orange flowers and lack of true leaves. The plant relies entirely on its host for nutrients, weakening the host plant and reducing crop yields. It is native to Africa but has spread to other regions, posing a significant threat to agricultural production. Its life cycle involves producing numerous tiny seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years, making it a persistent weed problem."
