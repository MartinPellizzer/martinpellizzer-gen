It is characterized by its short, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella balfourii is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
