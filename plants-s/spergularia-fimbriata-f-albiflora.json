    "intro": "Spergularia fimbriata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant features small, clustered flowers with white petals, which distinguish it from other forms of Spergularia. Its leaves are usually narrow and fimbriate, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
