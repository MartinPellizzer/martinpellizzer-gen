    "intro": "Sarcochilus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a compact, hairy rhizome with a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
