    "intro": "Salix pseudoalba, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and long, narrow leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist soils along rivers and streams, making it a common riparian species. The bark of Salix pseudoalba has been historically used in traditional medicine for its salicin content, similar to that of willow bark."
