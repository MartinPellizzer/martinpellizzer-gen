    "intro": "Selaginella brachyclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive rosette-like structure with closely packed, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its sporophyte phase produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Selaginella brachyclada is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms."
