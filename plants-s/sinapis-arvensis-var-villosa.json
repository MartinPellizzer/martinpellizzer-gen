    "intro": "Sinapis arvensis var. villosa, commonly known as hairy mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in siliques, which are elongated pods that split open at maturity. Hairy mustard is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
