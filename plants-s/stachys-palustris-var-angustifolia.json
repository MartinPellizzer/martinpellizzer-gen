    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf hedge nettle, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and other wet habitats. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is reflected in its aromatic foliage and square stems. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Stachys palustris."
