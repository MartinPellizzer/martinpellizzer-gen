    "intro": "Selaginella blumei, commonly known as the Blume's spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. Selaginella blumei is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its capacity for vegetative propagation through its specialized structures called stolons. This plant is also notable for its primitive reproductive structures, which include microsporangia and megasporangia."
