    "intro": "Struthiopteris filicastrum f. pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania sword fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, sword-like shape and a glossy, dark green appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
