    "intro": "Solidago gigantea var. pitcheri, commonly known as the Pitcher's goldenrod, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It typically grows to heights of 2 to 4 meters, featuring a robust stem and large, showy yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of lakes. Its ecological significance makes it a valuable component of native plant communities."
