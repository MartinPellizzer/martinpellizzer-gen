    "intro": "Solanum robustum, commonly known as the robust nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features thick, hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, and it produces small, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and considered a weed in some regions."
