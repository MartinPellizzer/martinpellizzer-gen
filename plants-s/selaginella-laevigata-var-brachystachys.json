    "intro": "Selaginella laevigata var. brachystachys, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to southeastern North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like clusters with closely spaced, needle-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, upright spore cones that are clustered at the base of the leaves, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitat."
