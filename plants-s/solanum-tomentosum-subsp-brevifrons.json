    "intro": "Solanum tomentosum subsp. brevifrons, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by yellowish berries. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are usually covered in a dense, white tomentum, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a common garden plant in warmer climates. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct within the Solanaceae family, particularly due to its unique leaf structure and fruit morphology."
