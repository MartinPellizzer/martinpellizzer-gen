    "intro": "Spiraea tortuosa, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It features slender, arching stems that often twist and curl, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Spiraea tortuosa is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
