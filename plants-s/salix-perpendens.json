    "intro": "Salix perpendens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has slender, light green leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a hairy underside. It produces small, yellow catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found near water sources."
