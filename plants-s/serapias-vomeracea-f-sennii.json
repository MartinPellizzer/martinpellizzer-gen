    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea f. sennii, commonly known as the Senn's serapias, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Italy and parts of Sicily. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which are spurred at the base and resemble a small horn, giving it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This horticultural form is highly valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
