    "intro": "Socratea karstenii, commonly known as the giant banyan, is a large tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its extensive, aerial roots that form a dense network, supporting its massive canopy. The plant has a unique ability to grow in dense forest understory conditions due to its ability to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and glossy, contributing to its lush appearance. Socratea karstenii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
