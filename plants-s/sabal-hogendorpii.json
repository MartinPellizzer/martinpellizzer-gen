    "intro": "Sabal hogendorpii, commonly known as the Florida torreya, is a rare evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and dark green, glossy leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
