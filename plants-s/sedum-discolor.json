    "intro": "Sedum discolor, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to North America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that turn a striking white or pale pink when exposed to full sun. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique color change and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, ornamental plants."
