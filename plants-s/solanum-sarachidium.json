    "intro": "Solanum sarachidium, commonly known as the Ethiopian nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and produces small, yellow flowers followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy surface, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe, making proper identification crucial for safe consumption."
