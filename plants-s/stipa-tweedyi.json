    "intro": "Stipa tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa tweedyi is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
