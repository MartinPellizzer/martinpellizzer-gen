    "intro": "Sporobolus argutus var. tuberculatus, commonly known as the rough muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ability to withstand drought and grazing makes it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
