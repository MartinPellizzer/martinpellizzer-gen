    "intro": "Selaginella cathedrifolia var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. This variety is native to regions with moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it helps prevent soil erosion."
