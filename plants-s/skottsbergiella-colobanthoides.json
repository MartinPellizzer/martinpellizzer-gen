The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Skottsbergiella colobanthoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and contributing to the biodiversity of its alpine and Antarctic habitats."
