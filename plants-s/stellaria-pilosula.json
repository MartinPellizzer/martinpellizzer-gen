    "intro": "Stellaria pilosula, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has thin, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are usually narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. Stellaria pilosula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
