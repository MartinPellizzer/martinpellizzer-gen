    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum basiorevolutum, commonly known as the shadow-leaf fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It exhibits unique adaptations to low-light conditions, including large, broad leaves that maximize light absorption. The plant's fronds are typically bioluminescent, a trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its reproductive structures are enclosed within protective sheaths, enhancing seed dispersal efficiency. Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum basiorevolutum is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
