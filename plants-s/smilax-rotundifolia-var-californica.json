It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or chaparral habitats. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
