    "intro": "Selaginella jouanii, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures. Native to China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its life cycle includes a distinct alternation of generations, with a gametophytic phase dominated by the leafy shoots. Selaginella jouanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
