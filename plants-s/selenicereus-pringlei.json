    "intro": "Selenicereus pringlei, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a climbing plant that produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant has thick, fleshy stems covered in spines, and its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The flowers are pollinated by moths and bats, which are attracted to the plant's strong scent and nectar. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking nocturnal blooms."
