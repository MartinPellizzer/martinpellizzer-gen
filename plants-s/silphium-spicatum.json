    "intro": "Silphium spicatum, commonly known as the spike silphium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Silphium spicatum is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
