    "intro": "Statice bahusiensis proles rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
