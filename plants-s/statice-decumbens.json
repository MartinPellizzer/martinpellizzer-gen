    "intro": "Statice decumbens, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with silver or gray-green hues that help reflect sunlight in harsh environments. Statice decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils along shorelines."
