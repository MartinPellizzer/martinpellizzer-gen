    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana subsp. porsildiana, commonly known as the Porsild's saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and are usually pink or red, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Saxifraga nelsoniana subsp. porsildiana is adapted to cold climates and has mechanisms to survive extreme temperature fluctuations and limited sunlight."
