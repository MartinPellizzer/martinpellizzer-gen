It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
