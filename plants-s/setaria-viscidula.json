    "intro": "Setaria viscidula, commonly known as sticky millet, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Setaria viscidula is adaptable to various soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
