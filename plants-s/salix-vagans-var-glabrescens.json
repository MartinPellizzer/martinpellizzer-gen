    "intro": "Salix vagans var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, pendulous branches that give it a weeping appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, glossy surface, which distinguishes it from other willow species. It produces catkins in early spring, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
