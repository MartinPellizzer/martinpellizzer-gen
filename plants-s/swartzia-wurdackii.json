    "intro": "Swartzia wurdackii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several hard, flat seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its habitat."
