It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woods. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
