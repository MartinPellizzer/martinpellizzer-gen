    "intro": "Syngonanthus cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climates of its mountainous habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
