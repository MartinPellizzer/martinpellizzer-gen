    "intro": "Simbuleta forskaohlii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it endure long periods of drought. Simbuleta forskaohlii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
