    "intro": "Silene nizvana, commonly known as the Nizhny Tagil catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Ural Mountains in Russia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Silene nizvana has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
