    "intro": "Sanguisuga, commonly known as the leech, is a segmented annelid belonging to the class Hirudinea. It is characterized by its elongated, soft body and the presence of suckers at both ends, which it uses to attach to hosts. Sanguisuga lacks true legs and instead moves by undulating contractions of its body. These organisms are primarily aquatic, though some species can thrive in moist terrestrial environments. They are known for their ability to feed on blood, using a specialized jaw structure to rasp the skin of their hosts."
