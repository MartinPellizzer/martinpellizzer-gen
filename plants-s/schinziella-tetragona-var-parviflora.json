    "intro": "Schinziella tetragona var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered Schinziella, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
