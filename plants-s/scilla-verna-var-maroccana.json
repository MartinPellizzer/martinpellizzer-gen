    "intro": "Scilla verna var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan windflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. It produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. This variety is closely related to other scilla species but is distinguished by its unique floral coloration and habitat preferences."
