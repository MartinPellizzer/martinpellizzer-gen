    "intro": "Stachycarpus standleyi, commonly known as the Mexican stachyurus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Stachyuraceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive leaves and the delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring.
