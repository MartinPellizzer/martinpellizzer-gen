    "intro": "Stellilabium boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian star-labium, is a unique flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes a wide variety of orchids, and is characterized by its intricate and often showy floral structures. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive star-shaped labellum, which is a specialized petal that plays a role in pollination. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Stellilabium boliviense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its rare and exotic appearance."
