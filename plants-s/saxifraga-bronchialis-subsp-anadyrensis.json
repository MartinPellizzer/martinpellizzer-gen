It typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
