    "intro": "Saussurea serrata, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in extreme altitudes. Its roots are highly valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
