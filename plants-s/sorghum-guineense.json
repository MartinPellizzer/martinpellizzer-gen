    "intro": "Sorghum guineense, commonly known as Guinea sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous stalks and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop in tropical regions. Its botanical features make it valuable for both forage and industrial applications."
