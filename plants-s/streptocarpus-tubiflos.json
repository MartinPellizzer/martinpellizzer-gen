    "intro": "Streptocarpus tubiflos, commonly known as the woolly streptocarpus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of violet or blue, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its inflorescence is a raceme, with flowers arranged along a central stem. Streptocarpus tubiflos is well-suited for cultivation in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
