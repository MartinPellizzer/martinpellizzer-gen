    "intro": "Solanum melongenum, commonly known as the nightshade plant, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to South America and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance."
