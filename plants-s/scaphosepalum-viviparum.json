    "intro": "Scaphosepalum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, where the plant produces live offspring through vivipary, a process in which seedlings develop on the mother plant before being dispersed. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and a rosette of fleshy, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with purple or brown markings, and they are arranged in a spike. Scaphosepalum viviparum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological studies due to its unusual reproductive biology."
