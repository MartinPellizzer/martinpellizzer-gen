    "intro": "Saccharum sape, commonly known as sugar cane. It is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stalks that contain a high concentration of sucrose. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, with a fibrous structure that supports its growth in wet, nutrient-rich soils. Saccharum sape plays a significant role in agriculture, particularly in the production of sugar and biofuels."
