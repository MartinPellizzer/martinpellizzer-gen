    "intro": "Sarcochilus calcaratus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, wiry stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its unique morphology includes a distinctive, calcified root system that helps it anchor in harsh environments. Sarcochilus calcaratus is a rare and protected species, valued for its ecological and botanical significance."
