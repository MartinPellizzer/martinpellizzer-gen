    "intro": "Saxifraga yarlungzangboensis, commonly known as the Yarlungzangbo saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found on rocky slopes and mountain ridges. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh, arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals, and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a vulnerable species."
