    "intro": "Stevia arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, spider-like appearance due to its dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its unique appearance and potential health benefits, it has gained interest in both horticultural and medicinal contexts."
