    "intro": "Styphelia brachyloma, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental value to its appearance. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and dark green, adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Styphelia brachyloma is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray."
