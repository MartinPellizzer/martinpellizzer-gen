    "intro": "Succisa alpina, commonly known as alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically features fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in its arid, alpine environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra. Succisa alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
