    "intro": "Satureja forbesii var. inodora, commonly known as the scentless woodruff, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are small, ovate, and often have a slight pubescence, while its flowers are small and clustered in whorls. Despite its name, it is not entirely scentless, but its fragrance is much milder compared to other members of the genus."
