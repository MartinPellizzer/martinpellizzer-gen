    "intro": "Saxifraga gibraltarica, commonly known as Gibraltar saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of Gibraltar. It thrives in well-drained, limestone soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal conditions of its native environment. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky surroundings. Saxifraga gibraltarica is a symbol of the unique flora found in the Rock of Gibraltar."
