    "intro": "Specklinia tamboensis, commonly known as the Tamboensis Vanda, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, arranged in racemes. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Specklinia tamboensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
