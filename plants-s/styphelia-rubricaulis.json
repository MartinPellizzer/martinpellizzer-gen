    "intro": "Styphelia rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, which are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Styphelia rubricaulis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. It is a valued species for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
