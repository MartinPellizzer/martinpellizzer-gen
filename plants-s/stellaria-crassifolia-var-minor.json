    "intro": "Stellaria crassifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Its stems are typically prostrate or ascending, often rooting at the nodes. This plant is often found in rocky soils and tundra habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
