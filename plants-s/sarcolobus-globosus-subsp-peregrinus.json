    "intro": "Sarcolobus globosus subsp. peregrinus, commonly known as the wandering globular lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive globular growth form. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is typically found on bark or stone in temperate regions. The thallus is crustose, with a dense, granular texture that gives it a rounded appearance. It produces spores in apothecia, which are small and often embedded within the thallus. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in forested areas."
