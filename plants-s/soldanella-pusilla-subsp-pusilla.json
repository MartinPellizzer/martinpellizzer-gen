    "intro": "Soldanella pusilla subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sandpink, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually unbranched. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
