    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-fruit elderberry, is a botanical variant of the common elderberry. It is characterized by its distinctive green berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter, setting it apart from the typical red or black berries of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub native to North America, often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by its unique green fruiting bodies. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
