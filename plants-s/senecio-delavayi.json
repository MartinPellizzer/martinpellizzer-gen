    "intro": "Senecio delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwest China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow, with prominent central disc flowers surrounded by ray florets, typical of the genus Senecio."
