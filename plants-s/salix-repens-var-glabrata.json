    "intro": "Salix repens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth willow or creeping willow, is a variant of the willow genus native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats or low shrubs. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, glabrous surface, which distinguishes it from other willow varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and along forest edges. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
