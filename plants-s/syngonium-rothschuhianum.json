    "intro": "Syngonium rothschuhianum, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that vary in color from solid green to variegated patterns of white and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used as a decorative vine in gardens and indoor spaces. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and hanging baskets."
