    "intro": "Sporobolus asper var. macer, commonly known as rough speargrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its wiry, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities in arid regions."
