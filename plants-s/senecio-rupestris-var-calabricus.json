    "intro": "Senecio rupestris var. calabricus, commonly known as the Calabrian rock everlasting, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features dense, fleshy foliage that is typically green with a bluish tinge, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in Mediterranean climates."
