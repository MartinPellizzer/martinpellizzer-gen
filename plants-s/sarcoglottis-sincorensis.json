    "intro": "Sarcoglottis sincorensis, commonly known as the Sierra Leone wax plant, is a flowering plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, waxy, yellow-orange bracts that enclose its small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Sarcoglottis sincorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
