    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled beauty, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy petals that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, often displaying vibrant shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers bloom during the late spring and early summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sudamerlycaste longipetala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
