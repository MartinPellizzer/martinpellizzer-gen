It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, silver-haired inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Silky foxtail is sometimes considered a weed but is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
