    "intro": "Solanum furcatum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, and they contain toxic compounds similar to other members of the Solanum genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
