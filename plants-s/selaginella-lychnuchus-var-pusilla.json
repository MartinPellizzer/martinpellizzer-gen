    "intro": "Selaginella lychnuchus var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a small, low-growing fern ally native to North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, giving it a soft, moss-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its compact size and ability to survive in harsh, humid conditions."
