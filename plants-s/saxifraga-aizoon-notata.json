It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Saxifraga aizoon notata is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
