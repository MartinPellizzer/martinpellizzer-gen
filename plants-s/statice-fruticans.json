    "intro": "Statice fruticans, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to pink. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal areas where it helps stabilize the soil. Its fibrous roots and salt tolerance make it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice fruticans is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
