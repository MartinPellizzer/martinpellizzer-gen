It features a fibrous root system and a tall, leafless stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
