    "intro": "Saxifraga adscendens, commonly known as the ascending saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are succulent and arranged in a rosette, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Saxifraga adscendens is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
