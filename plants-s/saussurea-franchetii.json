    "intro": "Saussurea franchetii, commonly known as the Tibetan yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Tibet. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, yellowish flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saussurea franchetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
