    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Central and South America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common wetland plant."
