    "intro": "Scilla ingridiae, commonly known as the Ingrid's scilla, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, Scilla ingridiae is considered a species of conservation concern."
