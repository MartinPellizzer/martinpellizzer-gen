    "intro": "Sorghum exaltatum, commonly known as the tall sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, erect stem and large, feathery panicles that produce small, white to pale blue flowers. This species is often cultivated for its high biomass yield and is used in forage, biofuel, and animal feed production. Its adaptability to diverse soil types and drought tolerance make it a valuable crop in arid environments. The plant also has cultural significance in some regions where it is used in traditional practices and rituals."
