    "intro": "Stenogyne hiloensis, commonly known as Hilo false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the island's wetter mountain slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
