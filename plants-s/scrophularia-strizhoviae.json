    "intro": "Scrophularia strizhoviae, commonly known as the Strizhovia scrophularia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species with showy, often tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
