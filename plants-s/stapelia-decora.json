    "intro": "Stapelia decora, commonly known as the star-shaped stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Stapelia decora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
