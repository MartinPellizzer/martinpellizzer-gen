    "intro": "Scabiosa pulsatilloides, commonly known as the creeping scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver, and its stems are usually prostrate or ascending. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa pulsatilloides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
