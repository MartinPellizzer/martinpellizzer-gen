    "intro": "Saxifraga demissa, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga demissa is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in mountainous and arctic regions."
