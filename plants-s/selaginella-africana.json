    "intro": "Selaginella africana, commonly known as the African spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like or needle-shaped. It is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms. Selaginella africana is also notable for its spore-producing structures, which are borne on specialized leaves called sporophylls."
