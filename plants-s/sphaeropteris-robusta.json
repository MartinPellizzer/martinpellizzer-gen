    "intro": "Sphaeropteris robusta, commonly known as the robust cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
