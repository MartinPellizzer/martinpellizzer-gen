The plant produces star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
