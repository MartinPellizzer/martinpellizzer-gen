    "intro": "Scabiosa maritima subsp. cupanii, commonly known as the sea scabious, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in maritime habitats."
