    "intro": "Schedonorus arundinaceus subsp. corsicus, commonly known as Corsican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. This plant is adapted to rocky and coastal environments, making it a hardy species suitable for erosion control in marginal soils."
