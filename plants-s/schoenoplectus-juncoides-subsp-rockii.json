    "intro": "Schoenoplectus juncoides subsp. rockii, commonly known as Rock's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
