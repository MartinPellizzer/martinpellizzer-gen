    "intro": "Spergularia rubra subsp. diandra, commonly known as red sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in disturbed or dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. The subspecies diandra is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Spergularia rubra."
