    "intro": "Scabiosa weyleri, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its dry environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Scabiosa weyleri is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
