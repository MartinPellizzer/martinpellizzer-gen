    "intro": "Sterculia cuneata, commonly known as the broad-leafed sterculia, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the wood is valued for its durability and workability in carpentry. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in rainforests and coastal areas."
