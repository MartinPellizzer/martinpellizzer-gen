    "intro": "Saxifraga ampullacea, commonly known as the bladder saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its harsh, cold environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine tundra habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a notable species in botanical studies of cold-climate flora."
