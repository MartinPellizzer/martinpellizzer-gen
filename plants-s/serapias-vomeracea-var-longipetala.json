    "intro": "Serapias vomeracea var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petalled sandwort, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its vivid yellow flowers with prominent, elongated petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
