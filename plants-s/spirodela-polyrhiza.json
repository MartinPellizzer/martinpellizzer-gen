    "intro": "Spirodela polyrhiza, commonly known as water velvet, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a simple, leafless stem with small, broad leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of small, round seeds. Spirodela polyrhiza is known for its rapid growth rate, making it both a valuable resource in ecological studies and a potential invasive species in some water bodies. Its ability to absorb nutrients makes it useful in bioremediation efforts."
