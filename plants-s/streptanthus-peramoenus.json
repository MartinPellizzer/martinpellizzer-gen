It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as hillsides and chaparral. It is an annual or biennial plant, often found in areas with well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
