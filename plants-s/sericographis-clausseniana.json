    "intro": "Sericographis clausseniana, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry grasslands. Sericographis clausseniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes."
