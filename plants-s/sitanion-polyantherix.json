    "intro": "Sitanion polyantherix, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. The flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom during the cooler months. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
