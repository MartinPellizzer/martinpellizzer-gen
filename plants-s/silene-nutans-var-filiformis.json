    "intro": "Silene nutans var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender nodding catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing herb with hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are alternate and linear, while its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, thread-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name."
