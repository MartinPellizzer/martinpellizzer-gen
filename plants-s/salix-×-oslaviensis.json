    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 oslaviensis, commonly known as the Oslewis willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its flexible, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkins as its primary reproductive structure, typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix \u00d7 oslaviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in ecological restoration projects."
