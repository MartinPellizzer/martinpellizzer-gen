It is characterized by its dense, radiating inflorescence that gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are sturdy and often reddish in color. This subspecies plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
