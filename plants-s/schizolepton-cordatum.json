    "intro": "Schizolepton cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf schizolepton, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Schizolepton cordatum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both horticultural collections and ecological studies."
