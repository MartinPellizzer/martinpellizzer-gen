It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The leaves are narrow and covered in a dense, silky layer of fine hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is characteristic of mesic to wetland habitats."
