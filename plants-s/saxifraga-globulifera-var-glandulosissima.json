    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative alpine plant."
