    "intro": "Sparaxis meleagris, commonly known as the \"Garden Sparaxis,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous narrow, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features linear, grass-like leaves. It blooms in late winter to early spring, producing vivid yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Sparaxis meleagris is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and sun-loving nature."
