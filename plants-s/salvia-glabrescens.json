    "intro": "Salvia glabrescens, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees, contributing to its ecological value in native gardens."
