    "intro": "Sideroxylon baladense, commonly known as the Baladense ironwood, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
