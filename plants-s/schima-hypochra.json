    "intro": "Schima hypochra, commonly known as Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. Schima hypochra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in some regions."
