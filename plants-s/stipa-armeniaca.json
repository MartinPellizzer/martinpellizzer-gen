    "intro": "Stipa armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, narrow spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native range. Stipa armeniaca is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its distinctive appearance."
