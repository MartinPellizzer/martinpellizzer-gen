    "intro": "Stapelia umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, waxy flowers that resemble a cluster of small umbrellas, hence its common name. These flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and bloom during the summer months. Stapelia umbellata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
