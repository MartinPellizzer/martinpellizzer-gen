    "intro": "Silene markamensis, commonly known as the Markam's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its mountainous ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, Silene markamensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
