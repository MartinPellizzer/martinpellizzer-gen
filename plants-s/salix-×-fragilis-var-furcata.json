It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. The plant has long, slender, drooping twigs that create a graceful, flowing appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal."
