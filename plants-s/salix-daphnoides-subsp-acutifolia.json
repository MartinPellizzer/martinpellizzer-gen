    "intro": "Salix daphnoides subsp. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing stream banks."
