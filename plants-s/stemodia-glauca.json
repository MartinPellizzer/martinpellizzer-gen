    "intro": "Stemodia glauca, commonly known as bluestem or coastal bluestem, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its blue-green foliage and small, clustered white or pale blue flowers. The plant has a woody stem that is often covered in a powdery blue or grayish bloom, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Stemodia glauca is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
