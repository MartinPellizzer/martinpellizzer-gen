    "intro": "Sphaeralcea endlichii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea endlichii is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
