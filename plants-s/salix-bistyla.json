    "intro": "Salix bistyla, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along dry streambeds. Salix bistyla is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
