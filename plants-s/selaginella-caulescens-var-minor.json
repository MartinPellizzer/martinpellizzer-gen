It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping stem with whorled leaves that are usually narrow and linear. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the branches and produce spores. This variety is noted for its low-growing habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
