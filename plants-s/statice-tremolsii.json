    "intro": "Statice tremolsii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy or saline soils. Statice tremolsii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
