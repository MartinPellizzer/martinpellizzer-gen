    "intro": "Stipa ucrainica, commonly known as the Ukrainian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, spikelike inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa ucrainica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
