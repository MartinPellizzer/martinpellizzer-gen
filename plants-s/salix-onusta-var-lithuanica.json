    "intro": "Salix onusta var. lithuanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe, particularly Lithuania. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along rivers, streams, and wetlands. It produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks."
