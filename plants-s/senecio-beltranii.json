    "intro": "Senecio beltranii, commonly known as the Beltran's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
