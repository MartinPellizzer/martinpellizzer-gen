    "intro": "Sisyrinchium arenarium subsp. arenarium, commonly known as the sandflower, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, blue to violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are usually low-growing and sprawling. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
