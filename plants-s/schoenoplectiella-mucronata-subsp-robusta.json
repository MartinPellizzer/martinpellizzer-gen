    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella mucronata subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust swamp reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a tall, cylindrical stem that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, which are often submerged or just at water level. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in its survival in aquatic conditions. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
