    "intro": "Salvia brandegeei, commonly known as the desert sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and gray-green, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its aromatic leaves and showy blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
