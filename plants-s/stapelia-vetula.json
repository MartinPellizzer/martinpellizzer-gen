    "intro": "Stapelia vetula, commonly known as the Cape Town stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia vetula is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
