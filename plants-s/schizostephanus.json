    "intro": "Schizostephanus, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. Schizostephanus species are often used in rock gardens due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
