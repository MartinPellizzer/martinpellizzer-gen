    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
