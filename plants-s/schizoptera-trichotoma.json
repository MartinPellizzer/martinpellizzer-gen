    "intro": "Schizoptera trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy leaf bladder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its drought-prone environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by hairy bracts. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Schizoptera trichotoma plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
