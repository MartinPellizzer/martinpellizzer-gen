    "intro": "Solidago retusa, commonly known as the threadleaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer and early autumn. Its floral structure is typical of the Asteraceae family, with composite flower heads that consist of disk flowers surrounded by ray flowers. Solidago retusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
