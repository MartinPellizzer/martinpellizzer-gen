It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are often fragrant. Its fruit is a pod that contains several elliptical seeds.
