    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 coesteri, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces catkins as its flowers, which are typically visible in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The weeping willow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
