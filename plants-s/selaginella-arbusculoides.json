It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct appearance with branching stems and small, scale-like leaves, which help reduce water loss in its habitat. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Selaginella arbusculoides is also notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
