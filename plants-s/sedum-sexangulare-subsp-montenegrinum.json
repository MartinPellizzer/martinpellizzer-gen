It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
