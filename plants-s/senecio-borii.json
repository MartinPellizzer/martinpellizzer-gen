    "intro": "Senecio borii, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Senecio borii is adapted to cold climates and has mechanisms to prevent water loss in arid conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
