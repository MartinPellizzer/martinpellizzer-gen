    "intro": "Saxifraga glaucescens, commonly known as the blue saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments where it thrives in well-drained, gritty soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of waxy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Saxifraga glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
