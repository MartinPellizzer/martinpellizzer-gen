    "intro": "Senecio trullifolius, commonly known as the wooly leaf senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
