It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Syzygium firmum is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and is valued for its ornamental and aromatic qualities."
