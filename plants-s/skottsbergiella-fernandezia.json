    "intro": "Skottsbergiella fernandezia, commonly known as the Fernandezia fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in coastal areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native ecosystem."
