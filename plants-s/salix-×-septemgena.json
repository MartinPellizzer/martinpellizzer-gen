    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 septemgena, commonly known as the seven-leaf willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba and Salix triandra. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring seven leaflets on each compound leaf, which sets it apart from other willow species. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as riverbanks and marshes, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it a useful species for erosion control and habitat creation. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and the plant plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
