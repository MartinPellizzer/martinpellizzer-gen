    "intro": "Stellaria barthiana, commonly known as the starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has thin, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stellaria barthiana is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
