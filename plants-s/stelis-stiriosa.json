    "intro": "Stelis stiriosa, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis stiriosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
