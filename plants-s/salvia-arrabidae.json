    "intro": "Salvia arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Salvia arrabidae is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
