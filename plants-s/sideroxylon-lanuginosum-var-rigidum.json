    "intro": "Sideroxylon lanuginosum var. rigidum, commonly known as the woolly ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures."
