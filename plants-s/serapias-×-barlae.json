    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 barlae, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a natural cross between Serapias acaulis and Serapias orchardii. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wet meadows and marshes of southern Europe. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in areas with seasonal flooding. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
