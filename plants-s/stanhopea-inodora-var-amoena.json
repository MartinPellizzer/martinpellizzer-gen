    "intro": "Stanhopea inodora var. amoena, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers have a subtle fragrance, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety. The plant is relatively rare and requires specific care to flourish in cultivation."
