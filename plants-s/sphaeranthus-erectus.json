    "intro": "Sphaeranthus erectus, commonly known as the upright sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Sphaeranthus erectus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
