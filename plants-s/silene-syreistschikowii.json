    "intro": "Silene syreistschikowii, commonly known as the Khabarovsk catchfly, is a flowering plant native to eastern Siberia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
