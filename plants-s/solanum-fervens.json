    "intro": "Solanum fervens, commonly known as the fiery nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, bright red berry that contains toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
