    "intro": "Salvia tenuistachya, commonly known as narrow-stamen sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia tenuistachya is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
