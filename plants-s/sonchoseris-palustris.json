    "intro": "Sonchoseris palustris, commonly known as swamp ragwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-haired leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
