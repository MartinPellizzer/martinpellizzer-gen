    "intro": "Schoenus rhynchosporoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, forming dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish colonies in suitable moist habitats. Schoenus rhynchosporoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
