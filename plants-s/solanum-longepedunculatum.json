    "intro": "Solanum longepedunculatum, commonly known as the long pedunculate nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white to purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or red when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
