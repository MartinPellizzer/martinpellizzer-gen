    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii var. alticola, commonly known as the Johnston's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and narrow, silvery-gray leaves. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. It is a perennial species that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its spread across its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
