    "intro": "Stevia ovata var. ovata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often used as a natural sweetener. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are responsible for its intense sweetness. Stevia ovata var. ovata is widely cultivated for its health benefits and as a sugar substitute in various food products."
