    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides var. conspicua, commonly known as the showy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color, adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its succulent leaves help store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. It is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
