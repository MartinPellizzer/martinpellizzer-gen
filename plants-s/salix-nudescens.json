    "intro": "Salix nudescens, commonly known as the naked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are male and female, and it is adapted to harsh, cold environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. Salix nudescens plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
