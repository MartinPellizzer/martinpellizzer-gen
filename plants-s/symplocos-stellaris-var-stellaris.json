    "intro": "Symplocos stellaris var. stellaris, commonly known as starflower or starwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often considered astringent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
