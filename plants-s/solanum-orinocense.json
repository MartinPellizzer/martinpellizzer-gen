    "intro": "Solanum orinocense, commonly known as the Orinoco nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided for human consumption but has been studied for potential medicinal uses."
