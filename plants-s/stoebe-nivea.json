    "intro": "Stoebe nivea, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for petals. Stoebe nivea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
