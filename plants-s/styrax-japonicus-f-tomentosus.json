    "intro": "Styrax japonicus f. tomentosus, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and a dense, compact growth habit. It is native to Japan and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils, preferring partial to full shade. The cultivar 'tomentosus' is notable for its hairy, grayish stems and foliage, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical form of S. japonicus. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
