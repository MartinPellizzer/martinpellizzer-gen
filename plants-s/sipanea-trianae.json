    "intro": "Sipanea trianae, commonly known as the Tana River cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to Kenya. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into flattened stems, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Sipanea trianae is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
