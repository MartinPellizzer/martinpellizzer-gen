    "intro": "Satureja domingensis, commonly known as Dominican thyme, is a small shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy leaves, and small, pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its aromatic properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
