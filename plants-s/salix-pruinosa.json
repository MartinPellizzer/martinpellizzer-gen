    "intro": "Salix pruinosa, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and striking silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin and a soft, fuzzy texture on the upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its main means of reproduction. This species is often found near water sources and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
