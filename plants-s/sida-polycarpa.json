    "intro": "Sida polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clusters of round, hairy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Sida polycarpa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and as a potential forage plant for livestock."
