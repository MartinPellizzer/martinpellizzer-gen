    "intro": "Spigelia chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and toxic compounds. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Spigelia chocoensis is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
