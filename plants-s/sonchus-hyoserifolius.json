    "intro": "Sonchus hyoserifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, spiky seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
