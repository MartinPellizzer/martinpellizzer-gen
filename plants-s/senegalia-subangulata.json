    "intro": "Senegalia subangulata, commonly known as the African broom, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, legume-like pods containing seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a common component of savanna ecosystems. Senegalia subangulata also has some traditional uses in local medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
