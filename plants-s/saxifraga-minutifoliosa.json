    "intro": "Saxifraga minutifoliosa, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a small, low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tiny, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are often borne on short, hairy stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga minutifoliosa is often found in mountainous areas of Europe, Asia, and North America, where it contributes to alpine flora diversity."
