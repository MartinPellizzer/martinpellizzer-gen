    "intro": "Scutellaria, commonly known as blue cohosh, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. These plants are characterized by their erect, often branched stems and showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Scutellaria species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. They are often found in woodland areas, meadows, and along stream banks, where they thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
