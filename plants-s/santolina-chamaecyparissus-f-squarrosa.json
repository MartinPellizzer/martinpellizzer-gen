    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus f. squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly santolina, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage with a dense, woolly texture that helps reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. Its aromatic leaves are often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
