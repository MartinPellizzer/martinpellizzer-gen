    "intro": "Selliguea dareiformis, commonly known as the rock tamarisk, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a mat-forming plant that typically grows on rocky substrates, often in humid and shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral differentiation, featuring a green upper surface and a darker, often reddish underside. Its reproductive structures, including both male and female gametophores, are borne on the thallus. Selliguea dareiformis is widely distributed across temperate regions and is an important component of moist, shaded ecosystems."
