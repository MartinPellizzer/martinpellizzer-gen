    "intro": "Scilla bifolia subsp. rara, commonly known as the rare bluebell, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family, characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue to violet. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and cool, humid climates. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are evergreen, providing a basal rosette that supports the flowering stems. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scilla bifolia subsp. rara is considered a rare and endangered species."
