    "intro": "Sophora juncea, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Sophora juncea is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
