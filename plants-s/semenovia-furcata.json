    "intro": "Semenovia furcata, commonly known as the forked lily, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short rhizome, which help it survive in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Semenovia furcata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
