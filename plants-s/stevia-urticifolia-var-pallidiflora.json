    "intro": "Stevia urticifolia var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food products. However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use compared to other stevia species."
