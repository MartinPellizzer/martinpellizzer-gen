    "intro": "Salix reticulata var. subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The leaves are usually bright green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a finely toothed margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of reproduction for this dioecious species. The plant thrives in moist soils along stream banks and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
