    "intro": "Silene cretacea, commonly known as the chalk hill caraway, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found on chalk grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene cretacea plays an important role in supporting local insect populations and is often found in conservation areas."
