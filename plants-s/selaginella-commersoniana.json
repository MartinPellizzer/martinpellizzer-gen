    "intro": "Selaginella commersoniana, commonly known as the Commerson's spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique form of spore reproduction, with both microspores and megaspores produced on separate structures. Native to South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant is notable for its ability to survive desiccation, a trait that has contributed to its adaptation to arid conditions. Its structure and reproductive mechanisms make it an important subject in the study of ancient plant lineages."
