    "intro": "Spiraea ostryfolia, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
