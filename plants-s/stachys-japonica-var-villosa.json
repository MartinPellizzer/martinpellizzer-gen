    "intro": "Stachys japonica var. villosa, commonly known as Japanese hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spikes of small, pale purple to pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and sprawling growth habit make it a resilient species in its native habitat."
