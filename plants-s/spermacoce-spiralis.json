    "intro": "Spermacoce spiralis, commonly known as the spiral morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, followed by distinctive, spiral-shaped capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas, and it is often found in moist, sunny environments. The spiral structure of its fruit is a notable characteristic that aids in seed dispersal."
