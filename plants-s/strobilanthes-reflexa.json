    "intro": "Strobilanthes reflexa, commonly known as the \"fairy lantern\" or \"kangkong flower,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped bracts that enclose its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Strobilanthes reflexa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
