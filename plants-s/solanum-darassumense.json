    "intro": "Solanum darassumense, commonly known as the Darassumense nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes plants such as tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when unripe. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is considered a species of interest for botanical research."
