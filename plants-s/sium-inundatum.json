    "intro": "Sium inundatum, commonly known as waterparsley, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It has slender, branching stems that often grow just above the water's surface. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
