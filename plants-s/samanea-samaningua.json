    "intro": "Samanea samaningua, commonly known as the raingreen acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Samanea samaningua is often used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and ability to improve soil quality."
