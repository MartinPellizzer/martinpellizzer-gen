    "intro": "Scirpus palustris var. vulgaris, commonly known as marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikelets that are wind-pollinated. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
