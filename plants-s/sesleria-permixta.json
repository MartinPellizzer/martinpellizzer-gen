    "intro": "Sesleria permixta, commonly known as the mixed hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Sesleria permixta is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
