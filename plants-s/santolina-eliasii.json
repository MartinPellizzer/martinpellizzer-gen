    "intro": "Santolina eliasii, commonly known as the Elias's santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features silver-gray foliage with a fragrant, lemony scent, and its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, mounding form and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often used in Mediterranean-style landscaping. Santolina eliasii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
