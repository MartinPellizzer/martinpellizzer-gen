    "intro": "Salix glauca var. macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's weeping willow, is a variant of the weeping willow native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a pale green or bluish hue. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
