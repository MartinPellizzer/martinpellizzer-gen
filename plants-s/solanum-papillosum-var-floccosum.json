    "intro": "Solanum papillosum var. floccosum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruits are berries that start green and mature to a deep red, often containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
