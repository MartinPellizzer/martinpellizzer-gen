    "intro": "Salix purpurea f. lambertiana, commonly known as the Lambert's willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and its distinctive purple-tinged leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
