    "intro": "Sedum surculosum var. fuscum, commonly known as the Black Rose Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, upright clusters of fleshy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-purple in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped, pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full to partial sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
