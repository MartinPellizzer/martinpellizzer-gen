    "intro": "Spiraea ostryfolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are densely packed, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to a variety of soil types and climates."
