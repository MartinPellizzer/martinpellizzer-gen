    "intro": "Sorghum subglabrescens var. rugulosum, commonly known as the rough sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall stature, typically reaching up to 3 meters in height, and its dense, fibrous foliage. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture, which is a defining trait of the rugulosum variety. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicle-like structures, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
