    "intro": "Sarcocornia alpini subsp. carinata, commonly known as the alpine glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It typically grows in wet, saline soils and is often found in estuaries, salt marshes, and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and salt, which helps it thrive in harsh, saline conditions. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
