    "intro": "Sapium tenellum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter green or sometimes pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release winged seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. The plant has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye in its native habitat."
