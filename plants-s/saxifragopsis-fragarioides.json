    "intro": "Saxifragopsis fragarioides, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, often white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Saxifragopsis fragarioides is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
