It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and is often found in moist, shady woodlands. It has a long, taproot that is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
