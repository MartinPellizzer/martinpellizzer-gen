    "intro": "Stelis ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis ottonis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
