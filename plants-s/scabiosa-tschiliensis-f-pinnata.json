    "intro": "Scabiosa tschiliensis f. pinnata, commonly known as the fernleaf scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
