    "intro": "Solanum glutinosum var. irazuense, commonly known as the Irazu nightshade, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in the highlands of Costa Rica. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. These berries contain numerous seeds and are often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not recommended for human consumption."
