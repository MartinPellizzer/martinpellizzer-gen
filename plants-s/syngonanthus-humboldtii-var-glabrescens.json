It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Amazon basin. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. The berries it bears are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds."
