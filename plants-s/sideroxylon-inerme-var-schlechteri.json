It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with thick, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-yellow in color, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
