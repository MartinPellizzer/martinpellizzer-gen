    "intro": "Solanum afzelii, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. Solanum afzelii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. It is important to note that, like many species in the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
