    "intro": "Scirpus oxylepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Scirpus oxylepis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
