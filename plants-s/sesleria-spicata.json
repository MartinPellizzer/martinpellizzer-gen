    "intro": "Sesleria spicata, commonly known as the spike grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Sesleria spicata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
