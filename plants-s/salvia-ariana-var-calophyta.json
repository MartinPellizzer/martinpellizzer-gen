    "intro": "Salvia ariana var. calophyta, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in whorled clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The species is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is characterized by aromatic oils and square stems."
