    "intro": "Solanum dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, berries that are often toxic, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
