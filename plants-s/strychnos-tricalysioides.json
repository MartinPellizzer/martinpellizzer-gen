    "intro": "Strychnos tricalysioides, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red or orange berries that contain toxic seeds. It is notable for containing strychnine, a potent neurotoxin, which makes it highly poisonous to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
