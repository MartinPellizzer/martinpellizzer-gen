    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 elsteadianum, commonly known as the Elstead hybrid, is a rare hybrid orchid resulting from the cross between Selenipedium alba and Selenipedium radicans. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the cloud forests of Central America and is adapted to high-altitude, humid environments. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
