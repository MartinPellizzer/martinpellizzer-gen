    "intro": "Sparganium \u00d7 splendens, commonly known as the golden burr rush, is a hybrid plant in the genus Sparganium, belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that develops into a showy, yellowish-brown spike during the late summer and autumn. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland vegetation structure. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
