    "intro": "Smilax glyciphylla, commonly known as the sweetgum smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of sharp, recurved spines along its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly wavy margin. Smilax glyciphylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks."
