    "intro": "Saxifraga pseudohirculus, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on slopes where other plants struggle to survive. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saxifraga pseudohirculus is valued for its resilience and beauty, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
