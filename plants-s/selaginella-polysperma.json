    "intro": "Selaginella polysperma, commonly known as the many-seeded clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its whorled arrangement of leaves and a short, erect stem. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations. Selaginella polysperma is notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation and fire, due to its unique physiological adaptations."
