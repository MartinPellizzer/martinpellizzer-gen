It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in two rows. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically located at the base of the plant. Selaginella grabowskyi is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
