    "intro": "Selaginella papagaiensis, commonly known as the Papagaii spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct appearance with upright, needle-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that helps it anchor in soil. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella papagaiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
