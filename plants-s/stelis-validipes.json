    "intro": "Stelis validipes, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
