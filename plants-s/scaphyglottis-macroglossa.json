It is characterized by its striking, elongated petals that resemble a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Scaphyglottis macroglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
