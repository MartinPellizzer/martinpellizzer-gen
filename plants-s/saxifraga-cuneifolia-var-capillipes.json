    "intro": "Saxifraga cuneifolia var. capillipes, commonly known as the hair-fringe saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Saxifragaceae family."
