It is characterized by its woody stems that twist and curl as they grow, creating an unusual and decorative appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Streblosa tortilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
