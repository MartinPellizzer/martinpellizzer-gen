It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The species is known for its alkaloid content, which makes it toxic and requires caution in handling or consumption."
