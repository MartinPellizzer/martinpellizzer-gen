    "intro": "Stenogrammitis wittigiana, commonly known as the Wittig's stenogrammitis, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Stenogrammitis wittigiana is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories."
