    "intro": "Sporobolus caroli, commonly known as Carolina sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed sites. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to stabilize soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
