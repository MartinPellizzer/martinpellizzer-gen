    "intro": "Saussurea prostrata, commonly known as the creeping safflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, branched stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Saussurea prostrata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
