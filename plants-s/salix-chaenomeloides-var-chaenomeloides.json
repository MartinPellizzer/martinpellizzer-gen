    "intro": "Salix chaenomeloides var. chaenomeloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
