It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its restricted range and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
