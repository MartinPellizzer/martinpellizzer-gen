    "intro": "Symplocos cuspidata, commonly known as the Indian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos cuspidata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with warm climates."
