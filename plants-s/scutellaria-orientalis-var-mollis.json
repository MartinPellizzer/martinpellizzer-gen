    "intro": "Scutellaria orientalis var. mollis, commonly known as the soft scutellaria, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
