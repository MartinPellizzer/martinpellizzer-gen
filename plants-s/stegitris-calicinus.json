    "intro": "Stegitris calicinus, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant typically has small, green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions. Stegitris calicinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion."
