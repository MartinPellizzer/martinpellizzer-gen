    "intro": "Stevia boliviensis, commonly known as the Andean sweetleaf, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, serrated leaves. The plant is renowned for containing high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Its leaves are typically harvested and processed to extract the sweet compounds. Stevia boliviensis is valued not only for its sweetening properties but also for its medicinal and cultural significance in indigenous communities."
