    "intro": "Swartzia laurifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and dense, aromatic foliage that resembles that of a laurel. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody pods containing elliptical seeds. Swartzia laurifolia is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
