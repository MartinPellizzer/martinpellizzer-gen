    "intro": "Sideroxylon lanuginosum subsp. rigidum, commonly known as the woolly ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has hard, woody bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. This subspecies is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can endure prolonged drought periods."
