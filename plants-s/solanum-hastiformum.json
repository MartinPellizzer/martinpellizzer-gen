    "intro": "Solanum hastiformum, commonly known as the arrowleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically green and later turn red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
