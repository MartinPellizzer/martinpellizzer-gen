    "intro": "Scrophularia rimarum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed scarlet root, is a horticultural form of the Scrophularia rimarum species. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant typically produces striking red or purplish flowers in the summer months. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. This form is adapted to well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
