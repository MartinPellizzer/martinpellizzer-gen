    "intro": "Senecio adenocalyx, commonly known as the whiteleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences."
