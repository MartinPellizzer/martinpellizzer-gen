    "intro": "Sclerochloa rigida var. major, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along a central axis, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Sclerochloa rigida var. major is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
