    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum sodiroi, commonly known as the shade-philic evergreen, is a rare plant species native to the humid forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and conical shape. The plant thrives in low-light conditions, making it well adapted to understory environments. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged spirally along the stems, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum sodiroi is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
