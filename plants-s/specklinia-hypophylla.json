    "intro": "Specklinia hypophylla, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, compact fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant typically has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Due to its unique morphology and limited natural habitat, it is highly sought after by collectors and botanists. Its cultivation requires specific humidity, light, and temperature conditions to thrive."
