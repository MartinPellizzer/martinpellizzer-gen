    "intro": "Sterigma chionophilum, commonly known as the snow-loving starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against frost. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
