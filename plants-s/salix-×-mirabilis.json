    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 mirabilis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often giving the tree a graceful, almost ethereal look. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a smooth margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive near water sources."
