    "intro": "Synoecia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf synoecia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Synoecia grandifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
