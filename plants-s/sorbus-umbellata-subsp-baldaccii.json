    "intro": "Sorbus umbellata subsp. baldaccii, commonly known as the Baldaccii whitebeam, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clustered umbels, followed by small, red-orange berries. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin, and they turn a striking red or orange in the autumn. This subspecies is often found in rocky or limestone soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
