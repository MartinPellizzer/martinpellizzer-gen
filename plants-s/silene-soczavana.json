    "intro": "Silene soczavana, commonly known as the Soczava catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene soczavana is considered a rare and endangered species."
