The plant thrives in cool, well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its flowers, which appear in early summer, are typically pink or red and are borne on tall, slender stalks. This species is known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates."
