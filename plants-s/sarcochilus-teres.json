    "intro": "Sarcochilus teres, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is a perennial species that thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
