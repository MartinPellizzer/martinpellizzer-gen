    "intro": "Salix balfouriana, commonly known as the Balfour's willow, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
