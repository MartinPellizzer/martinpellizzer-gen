    "intro": "Senecio sylvaticus subsp. viscidulus, commonly known as the sticky groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf texture and hair density."
