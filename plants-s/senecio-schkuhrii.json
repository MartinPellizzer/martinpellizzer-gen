    "intro": "Senecio schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhrii groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
