It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive reddish-brown bark. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn a striking red or purple in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streams and riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
