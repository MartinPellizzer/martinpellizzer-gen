It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arrowhead-shaped, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
