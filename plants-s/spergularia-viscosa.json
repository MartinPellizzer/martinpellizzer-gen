    "intro": "Spergularia viscosa, commonly known as sticky sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help in water retention. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Spergularia viscosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
