    "intro": "Staphisagria, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. Staphisagria is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
