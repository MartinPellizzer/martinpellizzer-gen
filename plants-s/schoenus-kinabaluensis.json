    "intro": "Schoenus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typical of sedges. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that are often concealed among the leaves. Schoenus kinabaluensis plays a role in the ecological diversity of its montane habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitat for other organisms."
