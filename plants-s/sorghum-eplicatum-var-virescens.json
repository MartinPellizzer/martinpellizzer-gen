    "intro": "Sorghum eplicatum var. virescens, commonly known as green sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species characterized by its distinctive green foliage and compact growth habit. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and thrives in warm, dry climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into hard, inedible grains, making it less suitable for human consumption but valuable for animal feed. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it an important crop in arid agricultural systems. The leaves are often used in traditional cooking, adding a unique flavor to local cuisines."
