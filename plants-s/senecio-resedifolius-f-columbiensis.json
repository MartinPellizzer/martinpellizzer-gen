It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
