    "intro": "Spodiopogon sibiricus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the Siberian hairgrass, is a grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Spodiopogon sibiricus var. tomentosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
