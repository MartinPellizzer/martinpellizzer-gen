    "intro": "Salix lavendulifolia, commonly known as the lavender willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
