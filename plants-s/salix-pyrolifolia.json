    "intro": "Salix pyrolifolia, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of the Salix genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, and they are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Salix pyrolifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and arctic ecosystems."
