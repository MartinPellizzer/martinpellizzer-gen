    "intro": "Salvia reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia reflexa is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
