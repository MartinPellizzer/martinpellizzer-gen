It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
