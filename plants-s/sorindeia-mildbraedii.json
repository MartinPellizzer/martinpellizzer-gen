    "intro": "Sorindeia mildbraedii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a rare and unique species native to South Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its thick, milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus. Its small, pale green leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorindeia mildbraedii is considered a vulnerable species."
