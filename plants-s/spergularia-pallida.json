    "intro": "Spergularia pallida, commonly known as the pale sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its small, pink or white flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its stems are typically prostrate, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. Spergularia pallida is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
