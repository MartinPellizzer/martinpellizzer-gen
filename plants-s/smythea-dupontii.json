    "intro": "Smythea dupontii, commonly known as the Dupont's smythea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are woody and upright. Smythea dupontii thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
