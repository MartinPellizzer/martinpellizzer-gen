    "intro": "Spergularia fallax, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to sandy and coastal habitats. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. Spergularia fallax is adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to retain moisture and withstand salt spray. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
