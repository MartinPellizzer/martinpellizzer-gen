It is characterized by its slender, wiry leaves and tall, spiky inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
