It is a small, creeping herb with closely spaced, scale-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces strobila, or cones, which contain spores for reproduction. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
