    "intro": "Stachys distans var. distans, commonly known as the wandering jew, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both versatile and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
