    "intro": "Suregada decidua, commonly known as the deciduous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are often deciduous, shedding in response to seasonal changes or environmental stress."
