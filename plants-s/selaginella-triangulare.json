    "intro": "Selaginella triangulare, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella triangulare is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its unique reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, contribute to its ecological significance in certain habitats."
