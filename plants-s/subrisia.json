    "intro": "Subrisia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, pale flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of scientific interest and botanical study. Due to its extreme habitat requirements, Subrisia is considered endangered and is rarely cultivated outside its natural range."
