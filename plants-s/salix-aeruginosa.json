    "intro": "Salix aeruginosa, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its bark and leaves contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, making it historically significant in traditional medicine."
