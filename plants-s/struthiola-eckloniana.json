    "intro": "Struthiola eckloniana, commonly known as the Cape ironwood, is a hardy shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it drought-tolerant. Its slow growth and resilience make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental use."
