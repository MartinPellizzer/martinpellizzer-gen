    "intro": "Stipa szowitsiana, commonly known as the Szowits' needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant flowers in late spring to early summer, forming dense panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Stipa szowitsiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
