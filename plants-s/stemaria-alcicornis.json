    "intro": "Stemaria alcicornis, commonly known as the horned stemaria, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its distinctive, branched stems that resemble horns. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a subtle beauty to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry climate. Stemaria alcicornis is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
