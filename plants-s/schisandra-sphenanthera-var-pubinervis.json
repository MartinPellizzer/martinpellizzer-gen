    "intro": "Schisandra sphenanthera var. pubinervis, commonly known as the pubinervous five-flower schisandra, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive five-flowered umbels and aromatic berries. The plant has lanceolate leaves with a hairy underside, and its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with five sepals and petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is highly valued in traditional medicine and conservation efforts."
