    "intro": "Sisymbrium linearifolium, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is an annual herb that lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its roots are parasitic, attaching to the roots of other plants to extract water and nutrients. Sisymbrium linearifolium is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
