    "intro": "Spiranthes seminuda, commonly known as the slender spirea or ghost orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a terrestrial herb with delicate, spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. The flowers are usually pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators."
