    "intro": "Shuttleworthia ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's shuttleworthia, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Shuttleworthia ruiziana thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soils, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
