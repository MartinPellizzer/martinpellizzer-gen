    "intro": "Salix rorida, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are elongated, narrow, and have a silvery underside, which adds to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal."
