    "intro": "Sassafras, commonly known as the sassafras tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant produces small yellow flowers that develop into orange or red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Sassafras has a distinctive root system that can be tapped for its aromatic sap, which contains safrole, a compound with historical use in the production of root beer. Its adaptability to various soil types and light conditions makes it a common sight in forested areas."
