    "intro": "Symplocos glauca var. tashiroi, commonly known as the Japanese waxleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental species in gardens."
