    "intro": "Stelis caucae, commonly known as the Cauca Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a delicate, fragrant appearance. Stelis caucae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
