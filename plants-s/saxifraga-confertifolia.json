    "intro": "Saxifraga confertifolia, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered with a fine layer of white wax. Saxifraga confertifolia is well adapted to harsh climates, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
