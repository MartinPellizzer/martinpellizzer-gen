    "intro": "Sabazia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sabazia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a bedding plant."
