    "intro": "Sempervivum ciliosum var. borisii, commonly known as the Borissii houseleek, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to the Alps. It features fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces upright, flower-bearing stems in late summer, which can reach heights of up to 30 cm. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. This variety is prized for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
