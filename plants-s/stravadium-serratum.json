    "intro": "Stravadium serratum, commonly known as the serrated thornplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
