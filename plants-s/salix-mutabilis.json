    "intro": "Salix mutabilis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has slender, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Salix mutabilis is also noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
