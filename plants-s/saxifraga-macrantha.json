    "intro": "Saxifraga macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered saxifrage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of showy, pink to white flowers with prominent stamens. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
