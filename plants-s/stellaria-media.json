    "intro": "Stellaria media, commonly known as common chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white star-shaped flowers with five petals, which give it its scientific name \"stellaria,\" meaning star. The plant has opposite, slender leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Stellaria media is an annual or biennial plant that spreads through seeds and can be considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
