    "intro": "Stanhopea insignis major, commonly known as the large white stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with intricate patterns of purple and green, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees rather than in soil. This species is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and unique floral structure."
