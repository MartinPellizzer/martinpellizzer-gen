    "intro": "Sagraea umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the shaded undergrowth of tropical forests. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-blue flowers that bloom in low light conditions. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve moisture. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific insects that are active in the dimly lit forest environment. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Sagraea umbrosa is considered a vulnerable species."
