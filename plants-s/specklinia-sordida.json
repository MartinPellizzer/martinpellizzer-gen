    "intro": "Specklinia sordida, commonly known as the dirty speckled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in small, speckled spots, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host, while its fronds are pinnately divided. Specklinia sordida is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
