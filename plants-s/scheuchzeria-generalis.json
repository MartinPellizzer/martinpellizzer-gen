    "intro": "Scheuchzeria generalis, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is an extinct species of lycophyte that lived during the Late Permian period. It was a large, tree-like plant with a trunk and branches, resembling a fern or a conifer. Its leaves were long and narrow, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. The plant reproduced via spores, typical of its evolutionary group. Fossil evidence suggests it thrived in swampy environments, contributing to the formation of coal deposits."
