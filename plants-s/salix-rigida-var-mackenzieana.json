    "intro": "Salix rigida var. mackenzieana, commonly known as Mackenzie's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in wet, boggy areas and is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a hairy surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
