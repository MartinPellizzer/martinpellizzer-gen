    "intro": "Salix alfredi, commonly known as the Alfred's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Salix alfredi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
