    "intro": "Solanum glaucum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. Solanum glaucum thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
