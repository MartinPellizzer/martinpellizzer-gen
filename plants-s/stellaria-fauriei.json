    "intro": "Stellaria fauriei, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a sprawling habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a silvery underside. Stellaria fauriei is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its ability to thrive in poor, rocky conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
