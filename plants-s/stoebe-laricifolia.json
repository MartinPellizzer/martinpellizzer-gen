    "intro": "Stoebe laricifolia, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Stoebe laricifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
