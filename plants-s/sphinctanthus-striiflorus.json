    "intro": "Sphinctanthus striiflorus, commonly known as the zigzag flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphinctanthus striiflorus is often found in rocky soils and is an important species in its native ecosystems."
