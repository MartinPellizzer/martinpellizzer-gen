    "intro": "Stipa diminuta, commonly known as dwarf needlegrass, is a small perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted clumps with fine, needle-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowering stalks bear small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple florets. Stipa diminuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
