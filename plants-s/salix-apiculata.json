    "intro": "Salix apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Salix apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
