    "intro": "Salsola splendens, commonly known as the silverleaf goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant has succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round, fleshy fruits. Salsola splendens is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, saline conditions."
