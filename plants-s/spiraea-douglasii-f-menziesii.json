    "intro": "Spiraea douglasii f. menziesii, commonly known as Douglas's weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with slender, arching branches that give it a weeping appearance. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth texture and a dark green color that turns yellow in the fall. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to moist, well-drained soils."
