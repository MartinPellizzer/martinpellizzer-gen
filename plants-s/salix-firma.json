    "intro": "Salix firma, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pale underside, and they turn a striking golden yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
