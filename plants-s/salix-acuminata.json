    "intro": "Salix acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically glandular and slightly hairy. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Salix acuminata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in woodland edges. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
