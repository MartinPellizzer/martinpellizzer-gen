It belongs to the family Salaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-winged fruit, which gives it its specific epithet \"disepala.\" The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Salacia disepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
