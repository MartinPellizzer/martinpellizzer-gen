    "intro": "Stanhopea esteponae, commonly known as the Estepona orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, thriving in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a complex inflorescence that supports its unique floral display. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stanhopea esteponae is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
