It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture. Silene chambaensis is a herbaceous perennial with a short stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the cold, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat."
