    "intro": "Savia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a nuisance in some areas but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
