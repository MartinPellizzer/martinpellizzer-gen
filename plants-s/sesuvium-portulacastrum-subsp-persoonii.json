    "intro": "Sesuvium portulacastrum subsp. persoonii, commonly known as seaside purslane, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, aiding survival in arid and coastal conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems along coastlines. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
