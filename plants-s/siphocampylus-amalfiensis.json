    "intro": "Siphocampylus amalfiensis, commonly known as the Amalfi siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
