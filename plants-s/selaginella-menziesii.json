    "intro": "Selaginella menziesii, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen herb with a rhizomatous stem that produces upright, spirally arranged leaves. The plant is characterized by its ability to survive in harsh environments, including rocky soils and arid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella menziesii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
