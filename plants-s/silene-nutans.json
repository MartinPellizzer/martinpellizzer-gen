    "intro": "Silene nutans, commonly known as the nodding catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that droop downward. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Silene nutans is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
