    "intro": "Scirpus chunianus, commonly known as the Chinese bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers at the top. Its rhizomes are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Scirpus chunianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
