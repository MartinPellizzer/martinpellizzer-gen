It is characterized by its elongated, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella macroblepharis is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in botanical research."
