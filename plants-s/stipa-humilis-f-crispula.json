It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and dry landscapes."
