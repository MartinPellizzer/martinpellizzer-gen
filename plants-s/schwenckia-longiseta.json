    "intro": "Schwenckia longiseta, commonly known as the long-stemmed schwenckia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and Louisiana, where it thrives in wetland and swampy environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Schwenckia longiseta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
