    "intro": "Schoenus fragifer, commonly known as the fragrant grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus fragifer is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Its aromatic leaves have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
