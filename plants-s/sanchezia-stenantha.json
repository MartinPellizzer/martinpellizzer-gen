    "intro": "Sanchezia stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sanchezia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. Sanchezia stenantha is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil."
