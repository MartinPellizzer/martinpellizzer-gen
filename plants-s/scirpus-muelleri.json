    "intro": "Scirpus muelleri, commonly known as the mueller's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the top of the stem, which are typically green or brown in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Scirpus muelleri is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies."
