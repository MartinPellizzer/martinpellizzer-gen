    "intro": "Salvia macrantha, commonly known as the largeflower sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Salvia macrantha thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
