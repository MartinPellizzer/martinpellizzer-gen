    "intro": "Soldanella alpina f. cyclophylla, commonly known as the Alpine soldanella, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This variant is distinguished by its cyclophyllae, which are rounded, thickened leaf bases that form a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
