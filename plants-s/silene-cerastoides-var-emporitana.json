    "intro": "Silene cerastoides var. emporitana, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, dark seeds. This species is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
