    "intro": "Senna podocarpa, commonly known as the New Zealand kowhai, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, narrow seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Senna podocarpa is also known for its ecological importance, providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
