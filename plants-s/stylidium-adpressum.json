    "intro": "Stylidium adpressum, commonly known as the flat-stemmed triggerplant, is a small, flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that are often adorned with contrasting black markings. Its unique method of pollination involves a specialized mechanism that triggers the flower to close when touched, aiding in seed dispersal. Stylidium adpressum is typically found in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
