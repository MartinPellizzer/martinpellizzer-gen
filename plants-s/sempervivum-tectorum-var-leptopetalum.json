    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. leptopetalum, commonly known as the Rosy Alp or Rosy Stonecrop, is a compact, evergreen perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette shape, with the leaves often tinged in shades of red, pink, or purple depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an ideal candidate for low-maintenance landscaping."
