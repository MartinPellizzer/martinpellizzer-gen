    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often harsh, rocky habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
