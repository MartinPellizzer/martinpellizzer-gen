    "intro": "Spiranthera, commonly known as the spiral flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of petals, which gives it its common name. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They produce small, often fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Spiranthera species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral display."
