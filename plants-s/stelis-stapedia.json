    "intro": "Stelis stapedia, commonly known as the Stapelia orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fleshy, and often hairy stems. The plant produces showy, reddish or yellowish flowers that resemble insect bodies, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting flies. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for water storage in its native arid environments. Stelis stapedia thrives in warm, humid conditions with bright but indirect light."
