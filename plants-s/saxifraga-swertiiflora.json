    "intro": "Saxifraga swertiiflora, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saxifraga swertiiflora is often found in moist meadows and slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 meters."
