    "intro": "Selenicereus urbanianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers at night. The plant is part of the Cactaceae family and is adapted to arid environments with its spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Despite its striking appearance, it is a slow-growing plant that requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
