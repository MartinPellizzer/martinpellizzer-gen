    "intro": "Schefflera elliptica, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Schefflera elliptica is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
