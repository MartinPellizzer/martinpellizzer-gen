    "intro": "Salix triandra var. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a graceful and ornamental look. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue on top. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is adapted to moist soil conditions."
