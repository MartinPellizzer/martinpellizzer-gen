    "intro": "Stapelia montana, commonly known as the mountain stapelia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish stems. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy succulent suitable for xeriscaping. Stapelia montana is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
