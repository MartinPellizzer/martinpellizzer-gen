It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to two meters, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Scirpus balearicus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
