    "intro": "Solanum lalandei var. leptacanthum, commonly known as the slender-fruited nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are typically small, green berries that turn red when mature, and they contain toxic compounds typical of the nightshade family. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
