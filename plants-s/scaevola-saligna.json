    "intro": "Scaevola saligna, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that are typically blue or violet, with five petals arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with salt spray and strong winds. Scaevola saligna is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
