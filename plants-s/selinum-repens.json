    "intro": "Selinum repens, commonly known as creeping parsley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring and are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. Selinum repens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
