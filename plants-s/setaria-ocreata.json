    "intro": "Setaria ocreata, commonly known as green foxtail, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence that resembles a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Setaria ocreata is often found in agricultural fields and is considered a weed in some regions."
