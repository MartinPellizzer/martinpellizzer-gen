It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen. Scirpus microcarpus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks."
