    "intro": "Speculantha furva, commonly known as the dark speckled orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish-purple petals and sepals, with a contrasting yellowish-white lip. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are small but highly ornate, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered in its native range."
