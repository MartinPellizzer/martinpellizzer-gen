    "intro": "Spergula salina var. urbicum, commonly known as the urban saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is adapted to tolerate high salt levels and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in urban and coastal areas. Its growth habit is usually prostrate, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant plays a role in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
