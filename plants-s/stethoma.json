    "intro": "Stethoma, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or egg-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Their flowers are usually small and clustered in umbels, displaying shades of white, green, or pink. Stethoma species are often found in woodland or grassland habitats, and they play a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
