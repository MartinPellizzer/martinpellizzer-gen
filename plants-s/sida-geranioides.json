    "intro": "Sida geranioides, commonly known as the common velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, and it can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural settings. Sida geranioides is adapted to a wide range of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
