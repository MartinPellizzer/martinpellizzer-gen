    "intro": "Scalesia villosa var. championensis, commonly known as the Champion's scalesia, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This shrub is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in dense, composite heads, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its foliage consists of thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, providing a distinctive velvety texture. The plant thrives in the humid, volcanic soils of the highlands, where it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
