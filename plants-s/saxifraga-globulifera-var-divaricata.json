    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. divaricata, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, forming tight clusters at the ends of the stems. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to flourish in harsh alpine environments."
