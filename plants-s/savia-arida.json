    "intro": "Savia arida, commonly known as the desert sage, is a hardy shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in low-water environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine. Savia arida plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
