    "intro": "Saussurea lingulata, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is also considered a symbol of resilience in traditional Tibetan culture."
