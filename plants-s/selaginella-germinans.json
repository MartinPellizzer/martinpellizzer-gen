    "intro": "Selaginella germinans, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, carpet-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Selaginella germinans reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called strobila. Its ability to thrive in humid conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
