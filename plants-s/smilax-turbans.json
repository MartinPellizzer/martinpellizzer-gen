    "intro": "Smilax turbans, commonly known as the turban vine, is a species of climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and anchor itself to supports. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are tuberous, contributing to its common name. Smilax turbans is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and thickets."
