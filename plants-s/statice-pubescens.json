    "intro": "Statice pubescens, commonly known as the woolly sea lavender, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that range in color from pink to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dune ecosystems, making it an important plant in coastal restoration projects. Statice pubescens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
