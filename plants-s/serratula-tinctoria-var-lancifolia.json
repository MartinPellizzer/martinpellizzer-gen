It is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its historical use in dyeing fabrics, it has been of interest in both botanical and historical studies."
