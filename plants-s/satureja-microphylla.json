    "intro": "Satureja microphylla, commonly known as mountain savory, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications due to its pungent, thyme-like scent. Satureja microphylla is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
