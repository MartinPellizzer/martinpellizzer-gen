    "intro": "Stenophyllus caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It typically grows in clumps, with short, stiff blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and erosion control in dry environments."
