    "intro": "Saxifraga scapigera, commonly known as the scapigera saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or barren ground. The plant has small, often clustered leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Saxifraga scapigera plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
