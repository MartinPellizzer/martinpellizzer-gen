    "intro": "Salix mongolica f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the Mongolian willow. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical species. This shrub or small tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in early pollination. The plant is valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
