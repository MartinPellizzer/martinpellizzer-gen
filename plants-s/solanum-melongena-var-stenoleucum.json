    "intro": "Solanum melongena var. stenoleucum, commonly known as the white eggplant, is a botanical variant of the eggplant species characterized by its pale, almost white, skin and slightly smaller fruit size compared to the typical purple eggplant. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia, where it is cultivated for its edible, mild-flavored fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that develop into the distinctive white egg-shaped fruits. This variety is valued in certain culinary traditions for its unique appearance and subtle taste."
