    "intro": "Satyrium afromontanum, commonly known as the African mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
