    "intro": "Sorbus latifolia subsp. scandica, commonly known as the broadleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
