    "intro": "Salix amerina, commonly known as the American willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and precede the development of its small, oval fruits. Salix amerina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
