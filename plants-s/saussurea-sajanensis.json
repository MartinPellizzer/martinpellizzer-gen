    "intro": "Saussurea sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant thrives in alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes with poor soil conditions. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a basal rosette of leaves, which help it survive in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
