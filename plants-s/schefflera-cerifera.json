    "intro": "Schefflera cerifera, commonly known as the waxleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or ornamental garden species. Schefflera cerifera is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
