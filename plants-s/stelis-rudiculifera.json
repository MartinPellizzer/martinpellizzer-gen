    "intro": "Stelis rudiculifera, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem that is often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Stelis rudiculifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
