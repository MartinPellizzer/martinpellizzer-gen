It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.

It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
