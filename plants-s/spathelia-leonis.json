    "intro": "Spathelia leonis, commonly known as the lion's tail orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that resembles a lion's tail, composed of numerous small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Spathelia leonis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
