    "intro": "Silene acaulis var. elongata, commonly known as the cushion plant or rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss. Silene acaulis var. elongata is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a characteristic species of mountainous and tundra ecosystems."
