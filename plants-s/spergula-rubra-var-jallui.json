    "intro": "Spergula rubra var. jallui, commonly known as red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in early summer. The plant has thin, succulent stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and resilient plant for rock gardens and alpine displays."
