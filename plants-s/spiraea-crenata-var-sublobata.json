    "intro": "Spiraea crenata var. sublobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features upright, branching stems and is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Spiraea crenata. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
