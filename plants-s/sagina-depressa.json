    "intro": "Sagina depressa, commonly known as lesser pearlwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are tiny, white or pinkish, clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. It is often found in Europe, Asia, and North America, and is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. Sagina depressa is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
