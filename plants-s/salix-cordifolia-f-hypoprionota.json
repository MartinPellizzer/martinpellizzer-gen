    "intro": "Salix cordifolia f. hypoprionota, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. It features elongated, lanceolate leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
