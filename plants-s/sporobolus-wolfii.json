    "intro": "Sporobolus wolfii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus wolfii is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
