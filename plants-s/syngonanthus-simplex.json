    "intro": "Syngonanthus simplex, commonly known as the simple thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Syngonanthus simplex is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical structure supports its role as a food source for various pollinators and small herbivores."
