    "intro": "Selaginella faucium, commonly known as the Spanish moss fern, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves. It is a spore-bearing plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its sporophyte stage is short-lived, and it relies on the gametophyte stage for reproduction. Selaginella faucium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
