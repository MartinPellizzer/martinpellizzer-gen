    "intro": "Stenotropis, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and can be either tubular or bell-shaped, with five petals. Stenotropis species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. They are also known for their milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
