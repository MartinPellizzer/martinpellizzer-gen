It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a labellum that resembles a star, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellilabium frymirei is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
