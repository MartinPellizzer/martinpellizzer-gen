It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh mountain climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
