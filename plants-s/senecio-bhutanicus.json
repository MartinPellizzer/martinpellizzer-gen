    "intro": "Senecio bhutanicus, commonly known as the Bhutanese groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Bhutan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Senecio bhutanicus is notable for its resilience to harsh mountain climates and its role in local ecosystems."
