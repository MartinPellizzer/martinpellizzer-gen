    "intro": "Specklinia corynetes, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
