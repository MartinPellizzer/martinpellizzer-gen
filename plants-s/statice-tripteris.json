    "intro": "Statice tripteris, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Statice tripteris is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
