    "intro": "Stipa pilgeriana, commonly known as the Pilger's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are highly ornamental and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
