    "intro": "Spergularia spruceana, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or coastal environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Spergularia spruceana is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
