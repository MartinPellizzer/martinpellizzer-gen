    "intro": "Sphenomeris biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered sphenomeris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-flowered clusters, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Sphenomeris biflora is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
