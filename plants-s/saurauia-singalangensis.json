    "intro": "Saurauia singalangensis, commonly known as the Singalang sandstone plant, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the limestone and sandstone habitats of northern Thailand. It is a woody shrub or small tree that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface and a distinctive dark green color. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in greenish-white clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Saurauia singalangensis is considered a conservation concern."
