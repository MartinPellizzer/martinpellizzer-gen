    "intro": "Sauvagesia rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-barked tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by orange to red berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Sauvagesia rubiginosa is often cultivated for its ornamental bark and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
