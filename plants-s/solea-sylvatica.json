    "intro": "Solea sylvatica, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland areas, along roadsides, and in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. The flowers are often used in ornamental gardening and have a mild, sour flavor."
