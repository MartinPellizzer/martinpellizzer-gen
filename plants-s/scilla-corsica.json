It is a bulbous perennial that produces striking blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Scilla corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
