    "intro": "Sticherus reflexipinnulus, commonly known as the reflexed pinnule liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pinnuleaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with a distinct central axis and lateral pinnules that are reflexed or curved backward. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus. Sticherus reflexipinnulus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
