    "intro": "Sempervivum leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees and southern France. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Sempervivum leucanthum is also valued for its ability to purify the air and its historical use in traditional medicine."
