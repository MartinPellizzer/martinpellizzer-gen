    "intro": "Selenipedium wallisii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and its distinctive, ghost-like appearance, with pale green or white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a very limited distribution, making it a conservation concern. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Selenipedium wallisii is considered endangered in many regions."
