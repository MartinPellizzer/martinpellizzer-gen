    "intro": "Scleropoa rigida subsp. hemipoa, commonly known as the hardstem needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rigid, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
