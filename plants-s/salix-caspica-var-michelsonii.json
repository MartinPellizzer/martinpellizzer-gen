    "intro": "Salix caspica var. michelsonii, commonly known as the Caspian willow, is a shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy beneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
