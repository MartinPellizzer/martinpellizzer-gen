    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. lesurinum, commonly known as the Lesurinum houseleek, is a compact, evergreen succulent with fleshy, rosette-forming leaves. Native to the Pyrenees region, it thrives in rocky, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of red or pink flowers in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
