    "intro": "Sphaeropteris cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, narrow, feather-like structure. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
