It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
