It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
