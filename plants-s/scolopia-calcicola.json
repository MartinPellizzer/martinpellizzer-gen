    "intro": "Scolopia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone scolopia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium carbonate, which is why it is often found in limestone areas. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Scolopia calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments."
