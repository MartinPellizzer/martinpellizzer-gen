    "intro": "Schefflera musangensis, commonly known as the Malayan umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of compound leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Schefflera musangensis is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
