    "intro": "Senecio leucanthemifolius subsp. crassifolius, commonly known as the thick-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
