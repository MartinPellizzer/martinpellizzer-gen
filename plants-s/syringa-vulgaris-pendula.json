    "intro": "Syringa vulgaris pendula, commonly known as weeping lilac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of fragrant, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its pendulous growth habit, with branches drooping gracefully, makes it a striking ornamental plant. Syringa vulgaris pendula is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
