It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs characterized by their aromatic wood and showy flowers. The plant is notable for its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Sandoricum radiatum is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic applications."
