    "intro": "Siphocampylus andropogon, commonly known as the narrowleaf false panicgrass, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are often difficult to distinguish from other grasses. Siphocampylus andropogon is adapted to tolerate dry conditions and is often found in regions with seasonal rainfall."
