    "intro": "Sabina alpestris, commonly known as the alpine cedar, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and compact, rounded growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sabina alpestris is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
