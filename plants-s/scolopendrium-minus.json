    "intro": "Scolopendrium minus, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant with a rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, or strobili, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. Scolopendrium minus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky soils or in woodland areas. Its simple, ancient structure reflects its evolutionary lineage as a primitive vascular plant."
