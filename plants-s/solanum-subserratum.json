    "intro": "Solanum subserratum, commonly known as the roughleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple color, often containing toxic compounds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
