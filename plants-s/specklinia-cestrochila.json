    "intro": "Specklinia cestrochila, commonly known as the broad-leafed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often crinkled fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are usually broad and can vary in shape, often resembling the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. Specklinia cestrochila thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
