    "intro": "Senecio scortifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other familiar flowering plants."
