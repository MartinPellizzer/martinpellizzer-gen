    "intro": "Sorbus latifolia var. semi-incisa, commonly known as the broadleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often lobed or toothed, with the lower leaf surface typically covered in fine, white or pale hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by white, apple-like berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its semi-incised leaf margins, giving it a unique appearance compared to other Sorbus species."
