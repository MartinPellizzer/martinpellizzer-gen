    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 virescens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The weeping willow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist soils, making it a common sight near water bodies."
