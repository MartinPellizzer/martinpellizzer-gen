    "intro": "Sagittaria chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Sagittaria chapmanii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
