    "intro": "Salvia distincta, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower clusters that appear in late summer and early fall. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Salvia distincta is a valuable addition to native gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to support pollinators."
