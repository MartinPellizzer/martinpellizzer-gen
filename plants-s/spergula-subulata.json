    "intro": "Spergula subulata, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on dry, rocky soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh conditions, and it is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Spergula subulata is an important component of certain ecological communities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
