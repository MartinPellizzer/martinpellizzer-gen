    "intro": "Spiranthes quadridentata, commonly known as the four-toothed ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Spiranthes quadridentata is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with other orchid species."
