    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum subsp. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited bur reed, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has a tall, cylindrical stem with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spiky, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed bur that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by water or animals. This subspecies is characterized by its compact, rounded fruits, distinguishing it from other members of the genus."
