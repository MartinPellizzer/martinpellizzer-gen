    "intro": "Silene patula var. tananorum, commonly known as the Tananorum catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
