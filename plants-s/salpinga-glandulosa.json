    "intro": "Salpinga glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky root plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a fibrous root system that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its sticky texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellow and bloom in late spring. The plant's unique adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
