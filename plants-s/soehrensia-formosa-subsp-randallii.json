    "intro": "Soehrensia formosa subsp. randallii, commonly known as the Randall's beautyberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces showy, purple-black berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of S. formosa."
