It is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue berries that appear in the fall. The plant has only one leaf per stem, which is a unique botanical feature. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its showy flowers and berries make it an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
