    "intro": "Schoenus capensis, commonly known as the coastal grass or Cape rush, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, sandy soils, and along rocky shores, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Schoenus capensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
