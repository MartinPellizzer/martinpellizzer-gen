    "intro": "Styphelia cognata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeastern North America. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with dense, needle-like foliage that forms a compact mat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels at the tips of the stems. Styphelia cognata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in dune or scrub habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
