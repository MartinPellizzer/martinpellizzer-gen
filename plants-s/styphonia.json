    "intro": "Styphonia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. Styphonia species are valued for their durable, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in crafting and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
