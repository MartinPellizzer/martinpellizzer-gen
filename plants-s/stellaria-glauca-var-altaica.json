    "intro": "Stellaria glauca var. altaica, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This variant is distinguished from the typical Stellaria glauca by its more compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution."
