    "intro": "Styrax suberifolius var. hayataianus, commonly known as the Japanese styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, reddish-brown berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal interest, though it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range."
