    "intro": "Solanum lasiantherum, commonly known as the purple potato or wild potato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to purple or violet berries. These berries contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance."
