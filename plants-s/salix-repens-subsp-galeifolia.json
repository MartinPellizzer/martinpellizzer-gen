    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. galeifolia, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its flexible, arching stems that often root at the nodes. It typically features small, oval leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are catkins, which are the characteristic male and female flower clusters of willows. The plant thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants, and it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
