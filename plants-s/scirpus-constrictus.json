    "intro": "Scirpus constrictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along rivers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct constriction near the base, giving it its scientific name. Scirpus constrictus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
