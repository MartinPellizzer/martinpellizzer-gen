    "intro": "Solanum muricatum var. dissectum, commonly known as the \"Swedish potato\" or \"Peruvian mountain potato,\" is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its tubers, which are edible, are often used in traditional Andean cuisine. The plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is valued for both its ornamental and culinary uses."
