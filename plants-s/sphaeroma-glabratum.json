    "intro": "Sphaeroma glabratum, commonly known as the smooth sphaeroma, is a species of crustacean rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. It belongs to the family Sphaeromatidae and is characterized by its smooth, rounded carapace. This organism is typically found in marine environments, such as tidal zones and rocky shores. It plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to detritus recycling. Due to its classification as an animal, it is not relevant to botanical studies."
