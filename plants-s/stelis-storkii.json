    "intro": "Stelis storkii, commonly known as the Stork's Bill, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowering stems are often branched, and it produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Stelis storkii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique growth habits."
