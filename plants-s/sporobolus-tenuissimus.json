    "intro": "Sporobolus tenuissimus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
