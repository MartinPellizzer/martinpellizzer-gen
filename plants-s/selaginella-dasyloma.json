    "intro": "Selaginella dasyloma, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a perennial evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its ability to enter a state of dormancy. It reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Selaginella dasyloma is often used in rock gardens and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
