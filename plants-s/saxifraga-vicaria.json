    "intro": "Saxifraga vicaria, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped and hairy, with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Saxifraga vicaria is known for its resilience and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
