    "intro": "Stipa aquarii, commonly known as the aquatic needlegrass, is a grass species native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, which support its specific ecological requirements. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Stipa aquarii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
