    "intro": "Stachys recta var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
