It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.
