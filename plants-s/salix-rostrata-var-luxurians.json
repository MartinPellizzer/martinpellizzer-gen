    "intro": "Salix rostrata var. luxurians, commonly known as the silver willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. This plant typically grows along riverbanks and in moist, well-drained soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological succession. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
