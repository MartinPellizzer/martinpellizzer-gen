It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its alternate, compound leaves that vary in shape depending on the variety. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing single seeds. The bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
