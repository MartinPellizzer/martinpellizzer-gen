    "intro": "Senegalia durangensis, commonly known as the Durango acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines, a common adaptation to water conservation in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in semi-arid habitats. Senegalia durangensis is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping in regions with similar climates."
