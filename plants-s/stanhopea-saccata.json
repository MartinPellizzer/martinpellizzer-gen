    "intro": "Stanhopea saccata, commonly known as the sac\u56ca orchid, is a tropical orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with red and purple markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Stanhopea saccata thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
