    "intro": "Solanum vespertilio, commonly known as the evening bat plant, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the southern United States and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant produces berries that are typically purple or black when mature, and they are edible but should be consumed with caution. Solanum vespertilio thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique flowering pattern and nocturnal pollination make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
