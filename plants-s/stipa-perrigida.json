    "intro": "Stipa perrigida, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Stipa perrigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
