    "intro": "Salsola longifolia var. verticillata, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round, salt-tolerant seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments."
