It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its foliage and flowers provide habitat and nectar for various pollinators and desert wildlife."
