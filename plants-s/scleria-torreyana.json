It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Scleria torreyana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
