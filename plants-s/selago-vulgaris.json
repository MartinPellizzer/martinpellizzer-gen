    "intro": "Selago vulgaris, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, greenish flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Selago vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
