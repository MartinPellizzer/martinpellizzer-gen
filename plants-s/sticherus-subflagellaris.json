    "intro": "Sticherus subflagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are present on the same plant, making it a monoicous species. Sticherus subflagellaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
