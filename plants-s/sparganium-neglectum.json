    "intro": "Sparganium neglectum, commonly known as bur reed, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that bear spiny bracts, giving it a distinctive, almost thorny appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Sparganium neglectum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and small vertebrates."
