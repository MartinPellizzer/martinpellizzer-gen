    "intro": "Spiraea microgyna var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
