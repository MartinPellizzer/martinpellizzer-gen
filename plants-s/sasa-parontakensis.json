It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Sasa parontakensis forms dense clumps through rhizome growth, contributing to soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
