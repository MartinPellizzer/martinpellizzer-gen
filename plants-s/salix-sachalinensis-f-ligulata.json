    "intro": "Salix sachalinensis f. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the Sachalin willow, characterized by its distinctive narrow, elongated leaves. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan and the Korean Peninsula, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, preferring well-drained to slightly boggy soils. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, woody fruits known as samaras. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
