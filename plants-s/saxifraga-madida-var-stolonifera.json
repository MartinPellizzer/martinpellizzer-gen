    "intro": "Saxifraga madida var. stolonifera, commonly known as the Stoloniferous Saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it well adapted to harsh environments."
