    "intro": "Specklinia ricii, commonly known as the emerald feather orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often with a speckled appearance. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture. Specklinia ricii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
