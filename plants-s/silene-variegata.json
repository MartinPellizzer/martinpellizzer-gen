It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often tinged with purple or variegated patterns, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Silene variegata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
