    "intro": "Selago diabolica, commonly known as the devil's lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique appearance and toxic properties have made it a subject of both fascination and caution among botanists and hikers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
