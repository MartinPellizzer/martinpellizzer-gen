    "intro": "Strychnos potatorum, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule and contain toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in traditional medicine, though it has been used in some cultures for its purported medicinal effects."
