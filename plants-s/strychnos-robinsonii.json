    "intro": "Strychnos robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's strychnos, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, mucilaginous coating. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities. However, like many members of its genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
