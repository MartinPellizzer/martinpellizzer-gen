    "intro": "Stevia adenophora, commonly known as the red stevia or red sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant is notable for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as alternatives to sugar. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation. Stevia adenophora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
