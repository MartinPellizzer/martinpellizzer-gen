    "intro": "Stemonurus laxiflorus, commonly known as the broad-leaved stemonurus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Stemonurus laxiflorus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
