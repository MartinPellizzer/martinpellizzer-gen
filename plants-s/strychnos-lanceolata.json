    "intro": "Strychnos lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark and roots have been used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains potent alkaloids. Strychnos lanceolata is often found in forest understories and along riverbanks in its native habitat."
