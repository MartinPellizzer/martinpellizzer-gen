    "intro": "Sida urugayensis, commonly known as the Uruguayan sida, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Sida urugayensis is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
