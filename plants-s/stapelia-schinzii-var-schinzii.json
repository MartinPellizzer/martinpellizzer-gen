    "intro": "Stapelia schinzii var. schinzii, commonly known as the Hooded Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with a red or orange rim. These flowers bloom during the summer months and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
