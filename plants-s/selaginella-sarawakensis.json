    "intro": "Selaginella sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern-like plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spiky foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized tissues. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
