    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia var. distans, commonly known as the Arctic sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and produces small, pink or white flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in extreme conditions. This variety is often found in tundra and mountain environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
