    "intro": "Salix farriae var. microserrulata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive leaves, which have finely serrated margins. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped and are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in forested areas."
