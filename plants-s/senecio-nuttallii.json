    "intro": "Senecio nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
