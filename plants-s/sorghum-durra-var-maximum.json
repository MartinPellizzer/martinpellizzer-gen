    "intro": "Sorghum durra var. maximum, commonly known as great millet, is a robust annual grass native to the warmer regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and large, drooping panicles that bear numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited rainfall. Its seeds, which are rich in carbohydrates and protein, are used for food, animal feed, and even brewing. The plant's resilience and nutritional value have made it an important staple in traditional agricultural systems."
