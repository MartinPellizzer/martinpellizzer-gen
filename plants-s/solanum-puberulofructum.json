    "intro": "Solanum puberulofructum, commonly known as the pubescent-fruited nightshade, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are typically covered in fine pubescence. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its potential toxicity, it is generally avoided for consumption and is more often studied for its botanical features."
