    "intro": "Sebaea cuspidata, commonly known as the Cape ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Sebaea cuspidata is often used in coastal gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
