It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically glossy and elliptical, providing a striking contrast to the delicate blossoms. The wood of Styrax candollei is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in the production of incense and perfumes."
