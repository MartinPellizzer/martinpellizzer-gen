    "intro": "Salix litwinowii, commonly known as the Litwinowii willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
