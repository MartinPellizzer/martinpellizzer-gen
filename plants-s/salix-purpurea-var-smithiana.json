    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's purple willow, is a variant of the purple willow native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in alpine meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright branches and bright yellow-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically male and female, and it produces small, fluffy fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting wildlife."
