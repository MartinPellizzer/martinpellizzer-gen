    "intro": "Solanum poeppigianum var. vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant bears berries that mature to a deep blue or black color, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
