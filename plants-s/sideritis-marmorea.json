It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, silver- or gray-haired leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Sideritis marmorea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
