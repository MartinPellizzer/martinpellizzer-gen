    "intro": "Styrax benzoides, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Styracaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, resinous sap that has been used historically for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by small, leathery fruits. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its bark is smooth and pale in color. Styrax benzoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
