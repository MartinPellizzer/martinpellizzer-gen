    "intro": "Stellaria media var. glabra, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, though the glabra variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along paths. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
