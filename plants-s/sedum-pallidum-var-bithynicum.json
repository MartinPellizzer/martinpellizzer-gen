    "intro": "Sedum pallidum var. bithynicum, commonly known as the Bithynian stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to regions of southeastern Europe and western Asia. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage and drought tolerance. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions, contributing to its ecological resilience."
