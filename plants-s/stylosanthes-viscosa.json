    "intro": "Stylosanthes viscosa, commonly known as sticky stylo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial legume that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and savannas. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its trifoliate leaves are typically covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Stylosanthes viscosa is valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important forage crop in livestock farming."
