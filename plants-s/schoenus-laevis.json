    "intro": "Schoenus laevis, commonly known as the silky bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and soft, silky leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes are slender and usually appear in late summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus laevis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
