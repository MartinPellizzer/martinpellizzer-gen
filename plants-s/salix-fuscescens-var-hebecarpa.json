    "intro": "Salix fuscescens var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the black willow or slender willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, riparian habitats such as streambanks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and produces catkins that are characteristic of willow species. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a distinctive grayish-white underside. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
