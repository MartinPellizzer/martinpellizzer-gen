    "intro": "Staelia reflexa, commonly known as the bent-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that curve downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of white wax. Staelia reflexa is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
