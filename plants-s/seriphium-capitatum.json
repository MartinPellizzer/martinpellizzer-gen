    "intro": "Seriphium capitatum, commonly known as the Great Basin gumplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and sagebrush habitats. Seriphium capitatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-arid conditions."
