    "intro": "Scabiosa sphaciotica var. decalvans, commonly known as the hairless scabious, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'decalvans' lacks these hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
