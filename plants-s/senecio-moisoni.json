    "intro": "Senecio moisoni, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled spheres that resemble snowballs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Senecio moisoni is also known for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
