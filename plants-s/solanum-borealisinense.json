    "intro": "Solanum borealisinense, commonly known as the Arctic nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white, typically during the short summer months. The plant produces small, rounded berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
