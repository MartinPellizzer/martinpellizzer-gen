    "intro": "Synaedrys grandifrons, commonly known as the large-fruited synaedrys, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Synaedrys grandifrons is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
