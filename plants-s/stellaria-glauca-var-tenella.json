    "intro": "Stellaria glauca var. tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a bluish-green hue, and the plant has a sprawling growth habit. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This variant is distinguished from the typical Stellaria glauca by its narrower leaves and more compact form."
