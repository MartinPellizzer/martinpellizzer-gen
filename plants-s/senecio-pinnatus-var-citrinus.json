It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
