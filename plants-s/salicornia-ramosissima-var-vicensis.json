    "intro": "Salicornia ramosissima var. vicensis, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or reddish and appear in clusters. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
