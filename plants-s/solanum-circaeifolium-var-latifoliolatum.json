    "intro": "Solanum circaeifolium var. latifoliolatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing several seeds. This species is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
