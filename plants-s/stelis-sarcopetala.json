    "intro": "Stelis sarcopetala, commonly known as the stone petal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a raceme of small, fragrant flowers with white to pale green petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Stelis sarcopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
