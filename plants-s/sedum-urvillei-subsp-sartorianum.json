It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
