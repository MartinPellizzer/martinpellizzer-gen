    "intro": "Simaba suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented simaba, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, honey-like aroma. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, round fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
