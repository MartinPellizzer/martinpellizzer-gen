    "intro": "Selaginella sulcata subsp. suavis, commonly known as the sweet-scented spikemoss, is a terrestrial moss plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in spirals. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its leaves are covered in tiny, scale-like structures that aid in water retention. Selaginella sulcata subsp. suavis is also noted for its faintly aromatic scent, which becomes more pronounced when the plant is dry."
