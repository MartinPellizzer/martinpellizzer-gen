It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often in shaded, moist environments. Sibbaldianthe species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in horticulture for their vibrant blooms."
