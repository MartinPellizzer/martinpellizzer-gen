    "intro": "Specularia parviflora f. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic dwarf catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balearic Islands. It features compact rosettes of hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with distinctive white markings, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
