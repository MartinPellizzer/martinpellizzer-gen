    "intro": "Salix hirta, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silver-gray bark and dense, soft, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, sandy soils and is often found near streams, lakes, or in moist tundra environments. Its catkins are an important food source for pollinators, and it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. Salix hirta is also valued for its hardiness in cold climates and its use in ecological restoration projects."
