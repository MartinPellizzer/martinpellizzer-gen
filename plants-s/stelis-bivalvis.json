    "intro": "Stelis bivalvis, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive two-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis bivalvis is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
