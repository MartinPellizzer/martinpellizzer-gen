    "intro": "Syngonanthus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the hard-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the autumn season. Syngonanthus sclerophyllus is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to Mediterranean climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
