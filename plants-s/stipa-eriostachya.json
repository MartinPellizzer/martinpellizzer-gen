    "intro": "Stipa eriostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. Stipa eriostachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
