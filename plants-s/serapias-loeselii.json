    "intro": "Serapias loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a mix of yellow and red hues. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its specific ecological requirements. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Serapias loeselii is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries."
