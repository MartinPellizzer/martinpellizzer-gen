    "intro": "Syringa spontanea f. alba, commonly known as the white woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is often found in woodland edges and moist soils. The white woodbine is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery."
