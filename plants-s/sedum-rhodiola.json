    "intro": "Sedum rhodiola, commonly known as the red stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems to survive drought. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum rhodiola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
