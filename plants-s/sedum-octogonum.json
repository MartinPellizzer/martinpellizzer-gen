    "intro": "Sedum octogonum, commonly known as the eight-sided stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum octogonum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
