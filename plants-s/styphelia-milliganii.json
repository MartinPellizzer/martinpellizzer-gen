    "intro": "Styphelia milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, moss-like foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
