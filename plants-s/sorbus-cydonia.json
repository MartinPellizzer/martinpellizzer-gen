    "intro": "Sorbus cydonia, commonly known as the common medlar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny branches and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces edible berries that mature in the autumn, though they are often astringent and require a process called \"bletting\" to become palatable. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. The plant has historical significance in horticulture and has been cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
