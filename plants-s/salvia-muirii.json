    "intro": "Salvia muirii, commonly known as Muir's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy blossoms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Salvia muirii is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
