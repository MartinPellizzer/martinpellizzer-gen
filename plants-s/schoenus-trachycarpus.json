    "intro": "Schoenus trachycarpus, commonly known as the hard rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet or moist environments. Schoenus trachycarpus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
