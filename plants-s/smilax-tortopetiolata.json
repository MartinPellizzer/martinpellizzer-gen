    "intro": "Smilax tortopetiolata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in sharp, spiny protrusions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax tortopetiolata is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
