    "intro": "Sempervivum minus var. glabrum, commonly known as the common houseleek, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant is adapted to rocky and dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
