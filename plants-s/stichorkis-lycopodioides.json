    "intro": "Stichorkis lycopodioides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged around its central stem, giving it a dense appearance. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Stichorkis lycopodioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
