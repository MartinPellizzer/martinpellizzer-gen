    "intro": "Swartzia froesii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and attractive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of elliptical leaflets, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Swartzia froesii is valued for its timber and has been historically used in musical instrument making due to its tonal qualities."
