    "intro": "Stramonium datura, commonly known as jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white, purple, or yellow. The plant produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Stramonium datura contains tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and\u83a8\u83ea\u78b1, which contribute to its hallucinogenic and poisonous properties. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in many regions."
