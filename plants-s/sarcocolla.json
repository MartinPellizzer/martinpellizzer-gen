It belongs to the family Sarcocollaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant exhibits a succulent habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to purple. Sarcocolla is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and limited distribution."
