It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, arid environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Senecio ambositrensis is often found in mountainous areas, where it contributes to the local biodiversity and ecological balance."
