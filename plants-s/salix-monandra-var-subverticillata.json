    "intro": "Salix monandra var. subverticillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a subverticillate pattern. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
