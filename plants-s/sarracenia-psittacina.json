    "intro": "Sarracenia psittacina, commonly known as the parrot pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its uniquely shaped, elongated pitchers that resemble a parrot's beak. The plant's leaves are modified into tubular structures that trap and digest insects, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The pitchers are typically green with red or orange veins, and they secrete a sticky fluid to lure prey. It thrives in wet, acidic environments and is often found in bogs and swamps."
