    "intro": "Stephanomeria exigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf starshine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Stephanomeria exigua is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
