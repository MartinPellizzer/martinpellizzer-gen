    "intro": "Sagina intermedia, commonly known as common pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in tight, spherical inflorescences called cymes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Sagina intermedia is adapted to temperate climates and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its compact appearance and drought tolerance."
