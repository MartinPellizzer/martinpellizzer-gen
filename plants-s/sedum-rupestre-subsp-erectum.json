    "intro": "Sedum rupestre subsp. erectum, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a succulent perennial native to rocky and arid environments in Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. It is often found growing on cliffs, walls, or in gravelly soils. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
