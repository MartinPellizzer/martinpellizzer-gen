    "intro": "Stelis chasmiphora, commonly known as the crevice orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from crevices in the soil, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Stelis chasmiphora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
