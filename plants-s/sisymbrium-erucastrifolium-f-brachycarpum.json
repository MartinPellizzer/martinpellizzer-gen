    "intro": "Sisymbrium erucastrifolium f. brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-seed hedge garlic, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant of the genus Sisymbrium. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded pods that differ from the typical elongated capsules of the species. The plant belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions with temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
