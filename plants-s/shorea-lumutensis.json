    "intro": "Shorea lumutensis, commonly known as the Lumut tree, is a species of dipterocarp native to Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It plays an important role in the tropical rainforest ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to the forest canopy. Due to its valuable timber, it is also a species of concern for conservation."
