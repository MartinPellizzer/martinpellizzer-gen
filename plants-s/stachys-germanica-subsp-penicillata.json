    "intro": "Stachys germanica subsp. penicillata, commonly known as German hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features square stems and opposite, hairy leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the mint family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf shape and floral structure compared to the typical form."
