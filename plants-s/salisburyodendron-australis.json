It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, fibrous bark that provides protection against fire and pests. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal or inland regions. Due to its resilience, it is valued for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
