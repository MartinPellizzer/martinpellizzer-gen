    "intro": "Sedum villosum subvar. kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
