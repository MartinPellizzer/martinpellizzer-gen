    "intro": "Schizolaena viscosa, commonly known as the sticky schizolaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, green leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream sides. Schizolaena viscosa is also noted for its sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
