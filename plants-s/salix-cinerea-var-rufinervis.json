    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with prominent, reddish veins. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in wetlands. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
