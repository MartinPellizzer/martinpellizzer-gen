    "intro": "Solanum pseudocapsicum f. calvescens, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, green, egg-shaped berries that turn red when ripe. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals, and it produces toxic alkaloids similar to other members of the Solanum genus. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires caution due to its potentially harmful properties."
