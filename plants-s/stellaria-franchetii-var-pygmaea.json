    "intro": "Stellaria franchetii var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
