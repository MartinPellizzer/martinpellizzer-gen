    "intro": "Spathoglottis lauterbachiana, commonly known as the Lauterbach's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred orchid flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
