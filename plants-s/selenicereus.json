    "intro": "Selenicereus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Cactaceae family. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their nocturnal blooming habits. Selenicereus species typically have cylindrical or branching stems covered in spines, and they produce large, showy flowers that open at night. The genus includes several species, such as Selenicereus trux and Selenicereus grandiflorus, which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value. Many Selenicereus plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic."
