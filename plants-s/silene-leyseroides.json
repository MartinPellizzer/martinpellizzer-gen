    "intro": "Silene leyseroides, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is a herbaceous species characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene leyseroides is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators and contributing to alpine biodiversity."
