    "intro": "Stipagrostis dhofariensis, commonly known as the Dhofar grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Oman and Yemen. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Stipagrostis dhofariensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
