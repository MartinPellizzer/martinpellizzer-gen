    "intro": "Salvia aequidistans, commonly known as the Mexican mint marigold, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of violet, purple, and blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it both a useful herb and an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
