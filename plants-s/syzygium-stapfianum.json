    "intro": "Syzygium stapfianum, commonly known as the Stapf's tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, reddish-purple fruits. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and has a tart, tangy flavor similar to tamarind."
