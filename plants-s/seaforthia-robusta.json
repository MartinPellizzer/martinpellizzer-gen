    "intro": "Seaforthia robusta, commonly known as the robust seaforthia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southern United States. It is characterized by its erect, woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Seaforthia robusta is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
