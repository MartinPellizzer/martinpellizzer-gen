It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary vegetation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
