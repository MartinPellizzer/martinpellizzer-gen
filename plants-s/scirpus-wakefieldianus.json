    "intro": "Scirpus wakefieldianus, commonly known as Wakefield's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose, cylindrical cluster. Scirpus wakefieldianus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
