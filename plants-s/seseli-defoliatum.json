    "intro": "Seseli defoliatum, commonly known as the leafless seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its reduced foliage, with only a few small leaves at the base. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
