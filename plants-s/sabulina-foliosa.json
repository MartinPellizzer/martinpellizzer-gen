    "intro": "Sabulina foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with four petals that are usually white or pale pink. Sabulina foliosa thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
