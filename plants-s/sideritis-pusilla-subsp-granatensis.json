    "intro": "Sideritis pusilla subsp. granatensis, commonly known as the granate dwarf ironwort, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as slopes and cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
