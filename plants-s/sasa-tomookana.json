It is a perennial plant that forms dense clumps of slender, hollow stems known as culms. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Sasa tomookana thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountain slopes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
