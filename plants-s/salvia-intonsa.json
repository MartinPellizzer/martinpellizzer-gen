    "intro": "Salvia intonsa, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Salvia intonsa is a member of the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens."
