    "intro": "Stathmostelma praetermissum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant is notable for its specialized mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring shaded, moist environments with particular soil conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is listed as endangered and faces significant conservation challenges."
