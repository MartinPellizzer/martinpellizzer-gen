    "intro": "Salsola ericifolia, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which helps it retain moisture. Salsola ericifolia is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of desert and steppe ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
