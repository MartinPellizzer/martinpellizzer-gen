    "intro": "Schismatoglottis calyptrata f. olivacea, commonly known as the olive-capped schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces striking, violet-colored flowers with elongated, spurred petals, typical of many orchid species. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
