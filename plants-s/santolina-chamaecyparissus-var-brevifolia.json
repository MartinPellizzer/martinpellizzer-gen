    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. brevifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and ability to attract beneficial insects."
