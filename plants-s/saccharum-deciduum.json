    "intro": "Saccharum deciduum, commonly known as the deciduous sugarcane. It is a grass species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow leaves. Unlike most sugarcane varieties, it sheds its leaves seasonally, adapting to seasonal changes in its environment. The plant produces inflorescences that are often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other sugarcane species, though it shares similar biochemical properties."
