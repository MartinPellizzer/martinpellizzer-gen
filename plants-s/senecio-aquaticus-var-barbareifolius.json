    "intro": "Senecio aquaticus var. barbareifolius, commonly known as waterleaf or water lettuce, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that float on the surface of water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in shallow water bodies. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
