    "intro": "Sida tehuacana, commonly known as Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida tehuacana is adapted to arid environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
