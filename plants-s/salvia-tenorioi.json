    "intro": "Salvia tenorioi, commonly known as the Tenorio sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is part of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and striking violet to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salvia tenorioi is considered a rare and endangered species."
