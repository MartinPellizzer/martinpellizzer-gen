    "intro": "Seseli calycinum, commonly known as the western seseli, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Seseli calycinum is generally not cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
