    "intro": "Spergula capillacea, commonly known as slender false oat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Spergula capillacea is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in its native habitats."
