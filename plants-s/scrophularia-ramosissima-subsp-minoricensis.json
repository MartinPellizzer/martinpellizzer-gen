    "intro": "Scrophularia ramosissima subsp. minoricensis, commonly known as the Minorca scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the Balearic Islands. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. The plant features erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces clusters of tubular, pink or purple flowers from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its island environment."
