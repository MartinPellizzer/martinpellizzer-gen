    "intro": "Serapias parviflora f. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-yellow sandwort, is a rare and striking alpine plant characterized by its bright yellow flowers. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Capparaceae) and is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are usually narrow and succulent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
