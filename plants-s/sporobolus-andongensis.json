    "intro": "Sporobolus andongensis, commonly known as the Andong grass, is a perennial grass species native to China. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of many grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Sporobolus andongensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
