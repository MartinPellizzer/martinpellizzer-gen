    "intro": "Spiranthes squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear dense, spiraling clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and pine woods. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, scale-like structures called squamules along the stem. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
