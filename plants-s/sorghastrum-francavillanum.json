    "intro": "Sorghastrum francavillanum, commonly known as the Frenchman's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
