    "intro": "Spermacoce tenella, commonly known as the small false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round, greenish-brown fruits known as schizocarps. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Spermacoce tenella is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
