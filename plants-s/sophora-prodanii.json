    "intro": "Sophora prodanii, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant, blue-violet pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. The seeds contain a toxic alkaloid, which makes it important to handle with care."
