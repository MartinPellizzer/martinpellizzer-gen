    "intro": "Spatularia michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's spatula, is a rare and delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, spatula-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered along the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
