    "intro": "Salix przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects."
