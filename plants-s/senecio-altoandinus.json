It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and harsh conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Senecio altoandinus produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
