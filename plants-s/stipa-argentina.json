It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. Stipa argentina is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and rocky areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
