It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This variety is prized for its compact form and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
