    "intro": "Saponaria officinalis, commonly known as soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Saponaria officinalis is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive flowers and foliage."
