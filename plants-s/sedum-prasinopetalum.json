It features fleshy, upright stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow-green flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established. Sedum prasinopetalum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
