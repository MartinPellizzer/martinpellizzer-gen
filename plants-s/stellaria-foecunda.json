    "intro": "Stellaria foecunda, commonly known as common starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Stellaria foecunda is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
