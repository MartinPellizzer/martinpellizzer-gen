    "intro": "Schwabea ciliaris, commonly known as the silverleaf schwabea, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance. Schwabea ciliaris is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained conditions."
