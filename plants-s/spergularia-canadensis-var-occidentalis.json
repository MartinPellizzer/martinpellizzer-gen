It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It has a rosette-like growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. The species is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as along roadsides or in dunes."
