    "intro": "Sloanea ensiformis, commonly known as the knife-leaf sloanea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often greenish-yellow in color, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Sloanea ensiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
