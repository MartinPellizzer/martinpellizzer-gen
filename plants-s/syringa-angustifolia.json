    "intro": "Syringa angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lilac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet and has a compact, bushy habit. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Syringa angustifolia is valued for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its showy floral display."
