    "intro": "Solanum sudanense, commonly known as Sudanese nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it has some medicinal uses in traditional practices. However, like many members of its family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
