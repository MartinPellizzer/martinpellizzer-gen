    "intro": "Sarcanthus koeteiensis, commonly known as the Koetei Mountains orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of the Koetei Mountains in Greece. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, terrestrial growth habit with a single stem and a cluster of small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus koeteiensis is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
