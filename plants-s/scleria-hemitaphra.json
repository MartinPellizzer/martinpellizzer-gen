    "intro": "Scleria hemitaphra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes and riverbanks. Scleria hemitaphra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
