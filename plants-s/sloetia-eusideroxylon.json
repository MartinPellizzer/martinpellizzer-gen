    "intro": "Sloetia eusideroxylon, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
