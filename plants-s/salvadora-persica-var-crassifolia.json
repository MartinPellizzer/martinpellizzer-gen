    "intro": "Salvadora persica var. crassifolia, commonly known as the Indian toothbrush tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often used as a natural toothbrush due to their abrasive texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and astringent properties."
