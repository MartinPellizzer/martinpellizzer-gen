    "intro": "Salaxis gracilis, commonly known as the slender salaxis, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
