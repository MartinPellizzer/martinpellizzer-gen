It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. Specklinia sarcopetala thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in the study of epiphytic and lithophytic orchids."
