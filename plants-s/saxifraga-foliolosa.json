    "intro": "Saxifraga foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or white, borne on short pedicels, and appear in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga foliolosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh environments."
