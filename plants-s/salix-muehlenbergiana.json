    "intro": "Salix muehlenbergiana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, woody berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, and the plant is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance."
