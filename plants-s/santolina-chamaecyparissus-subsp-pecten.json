It features dense, gray-green foliage that is aromatic and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
