    "intro": "Saussurea shangrilaensis, commonly known as the Shangrila Saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in poor, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
