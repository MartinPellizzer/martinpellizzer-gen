    "intro": "Schmidelia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth schmidelia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Schmidelia glabrata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its smooth, hairless stems and leaves contribute to its common name and distinguish it from similar species."
