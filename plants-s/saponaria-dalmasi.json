It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and has a fibrous root system. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Saponaria dalmasi is also noted for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from the saponins present in its roots."
