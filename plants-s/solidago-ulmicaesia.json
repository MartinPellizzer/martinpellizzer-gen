    "intro": "Solidago ulmicaesia, commonly known as the eastern goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small golden clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and along stream banks. It produces showy yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common and ecologically important species in its habitat."
