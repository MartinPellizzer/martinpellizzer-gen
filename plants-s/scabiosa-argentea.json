    "intro": "Scabiosa argentea, commonly known as silver scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its silvery appearance. Scabiosa argentea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
