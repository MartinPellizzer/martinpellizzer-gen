    "intro": "Stipa praecapillata, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Stipa praecapillata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals in its native environment."
