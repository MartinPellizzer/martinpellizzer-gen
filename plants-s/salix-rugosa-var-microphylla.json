    "intro": "Salix rugosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches that droop with long, narrow leaves. The leaves are typically glossy and have a slightly hairy underside, giving the plant a distinctive texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval berries. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
