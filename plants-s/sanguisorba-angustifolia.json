    "intro": "Sanguisorba angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Sanguisorba angustifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
