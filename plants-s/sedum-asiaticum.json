    "intro": "Sedum asiaticum, commonly known as the Asian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to eastern Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking resilient, ornamental plants."
