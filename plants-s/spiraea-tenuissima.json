    "intro": "Spiraea tenuissima, commonly known as narrowleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has finely divided, fern-like leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Spiraea tenuissima is also valued for its ability to thrive in rocky or alpine conditions."
