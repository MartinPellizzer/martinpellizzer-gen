    "intro": "Statice trigonoides, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Statice trigonoides is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting flowers and drought-tolerant nature."
