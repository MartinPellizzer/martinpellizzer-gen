    "intro": "Senecio pavonicus, commonly known as the Pavon's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Senecio pavonicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
