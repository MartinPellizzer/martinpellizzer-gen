    "intro": "Scolopendrium ruta-muraria, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiales and is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like and have a leathery texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophylls are arranged in cone-like structures called strobila. Scolopendrium ruta-muraria typically thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
