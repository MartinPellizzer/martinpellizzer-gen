    "intro": "Stellaria palustris var. heterophylla, commonly known as swamp starwort, is a variant of the starwort species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually alternate and may vary in shape, giving rise to its varietal name \"heterophylla,\" meaning \"different leaves.\" This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
