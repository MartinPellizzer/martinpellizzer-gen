    "intro": "Sageretia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny sageretia, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, spiny projections, and its small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sageretia spinosa is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
