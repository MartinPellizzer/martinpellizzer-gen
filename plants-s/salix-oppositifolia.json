    "intro": "Salix oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are typically opposite in arrangement, giving it its scientific name. Salix oppositifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in wet, rocky soils near streams or lakes."
