    "intro": "Semeiostachys macrochaeta, commonly known as the hairy spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, often with a prominent midrib. Semeiostachys macrochaeta is adapted to well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in open grasslands and disturbed areas."
