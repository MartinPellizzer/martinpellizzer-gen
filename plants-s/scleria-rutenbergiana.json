    "intro": "Scleria rutenbergiana, commonly known as the Rutenberg bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, three-lobed flowers in clusters. Scleria rutenbergiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
