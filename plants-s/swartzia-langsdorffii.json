    "intro": "Swartzia langsdorffii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated pods. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
