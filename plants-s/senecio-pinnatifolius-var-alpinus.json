It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that are pinnately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high altitudes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
