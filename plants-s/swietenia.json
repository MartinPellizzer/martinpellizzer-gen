    "intro": "Swietenia, commonly known as mahogany, is a genus of tropical hardwood trees belonging to the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white. The wood of Swietenia is highly valued for its durability, fine grain, and rich reddish-brown color. It is native to Central America, Mexico, and parts of South America. Due to overharvesting, many species within this genus are now endangered and protected."
