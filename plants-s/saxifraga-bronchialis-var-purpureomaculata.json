    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis var. purpureomaculata, commonly known as the purple-spotted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with distinctive purple or reddish markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
