It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream sides. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white and appear in clusters. Sinocarum caespitosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
