    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. graminea, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its small, rounded leaves and white flowers. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its stems are prostrate or ascending, and it produces numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory."
