    "intro": "Schefflera bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf schefflera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like foliage with deeply lobed, bipinnate leaves that give it a unique, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Schefflera bifida is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
