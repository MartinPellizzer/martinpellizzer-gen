    "intro": "Sclerolobium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican acacia, is a leguminous shrub native to Central America. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its woody, thorned stems and is often found in dry forest and scrubland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The seeds are encased in hard pods and are dispersed by animals or through mechanical means."
