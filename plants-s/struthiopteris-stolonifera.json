    "intro": "Struthiopteris stolonifera, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stolons that produce erect, branched fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance and a dark green, glossy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori."
