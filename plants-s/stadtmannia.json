    "intro": "Stadtmannia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, typically with five petals. The genus includes several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Stadtmannia plants are generally herbaceous, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for moist, shaded environments. Their unique appearance and limited distribution make them of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
