    "intro": "Stigmatosema pedicellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Stigmatosema pedicellata is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
