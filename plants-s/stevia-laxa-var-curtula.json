    "intro": "Stevia laxa var. curtula, commonly known as the slender stevia, is a species native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often cultivated for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain natural glycosides similar to those found in other stevia species. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is gaining interest among horticulturists and herbalists."
