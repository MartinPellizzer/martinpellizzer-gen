    "intro": "[WRONG START] Silene nutans var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate nodding catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that nod downward, typical of the genus Silene. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and rocky areas. This variety is distinguished from the typical Silene nutans by its slightly different flower structure and growth habit."
