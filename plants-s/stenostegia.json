    "intro": "Stenostegia, commonly known as the \"Cape honeysuckle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. The leaves are typically opposite and have a rough texture, while the stems are often woody and branched. Stenostegia species are often found in coastal areas and are adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Their botanical features make them popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
