    "intro": "Salix fengiana var. fengiana, commonly known as the Fengshan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins during the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
