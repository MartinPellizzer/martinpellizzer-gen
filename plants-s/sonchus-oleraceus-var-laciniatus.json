    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. laciniatus, commonly known as the cutleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, broadly lobed leaves that are often deeply cut, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a weed and a potential forage plant."
