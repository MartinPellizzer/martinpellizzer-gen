    "intro": "Stifftia hatschbachii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically 2\u20133 cm in diameter and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Stifftia hatschbachii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
