    "intro": "Saxifraga gedangensis, commonly known as the Bornean saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
