    "intro": "Staurogyne anomala, commonly known as the small water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Staurogyne anomala is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
