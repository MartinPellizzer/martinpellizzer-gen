    "intro": "Senegalia compacta, commonly known as the burro bristlebush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, bristly inflorescences, which give it its common name. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Senegalia compacta plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for desert wildlife."
