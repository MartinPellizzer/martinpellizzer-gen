    "intro": "Stelis stephanii, commonly known as the Stephan's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth. Stelis stephanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
