    "intro": "Sagittaria pugioniformis var. andina, commonly known as the Andean arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that rise above the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
