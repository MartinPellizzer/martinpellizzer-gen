    "intro": "Stobaea bergii, commonly known as the Berg's stobaea, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stobaea bergii is considered a species of conservation concern."
