    "intro": "Stelis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Stelis rostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
