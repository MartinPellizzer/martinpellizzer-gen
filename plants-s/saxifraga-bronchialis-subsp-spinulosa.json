    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis subsp. spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
