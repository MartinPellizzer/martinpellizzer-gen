It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and a spadix inflorescence that is often covered in small, inconspicuous flowers. Styloglossum johorense typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical plant morphology and ecology."
