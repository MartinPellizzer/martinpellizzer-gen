It is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rocky or wasteland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
