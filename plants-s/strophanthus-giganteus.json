    "intro": "Strophanthus giganteus, commonly known as the giant African milkweed, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits that split open to reveal seeds with silky filaments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, which have historically been used in the preparation of medicinal compounds."
