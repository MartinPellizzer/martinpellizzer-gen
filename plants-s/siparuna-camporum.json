    "intro": "Siparuna camporum, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Siparuna camporum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and landscaping in warm climates."
