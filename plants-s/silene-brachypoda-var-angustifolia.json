    "intro": "Silene brachypoda var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf flaxvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for pollinators."
