    "intro": "Sorbus tomophylla, commonly known as the redleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red-tinged leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, white, aggregate fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its ornamental value is due to its vibrant foliage and unique fruit structure."
