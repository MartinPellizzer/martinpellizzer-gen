    "intro": "Siphocampylus soraticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved campylus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinct, aromatic scent, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
