    "intro": "Schedonorus ciliatus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are followed by narrow, cylindrical seed heads. Schedonorus ciliatus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often forming dense mats in gardens or naturalized areas. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control."
