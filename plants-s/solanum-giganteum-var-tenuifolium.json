    "intro": "Solanum giganteum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved nightshade, is a variant of the giant nightshade species. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its thin, elongated leaves and showy, violet-to-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its berries, which are toxic, contain alkaloids and are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
