    "intro": "Senna paradictyon, commonly known as the golden senna, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The seeds are encased in a pod-like fruit, which splits open to release the seeds when mature."
