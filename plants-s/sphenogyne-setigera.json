    "intro": "Sphenogyne setigera, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping, velvety leaves that resemble a cloak. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which provide protection against herbivory and help retain moisture. Sphenogyne setigera is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
