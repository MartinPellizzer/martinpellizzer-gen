    "intro": "Solanum nematosepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, round berries that are often green when mature. It is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Solanum nematosepalum is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its uses."
