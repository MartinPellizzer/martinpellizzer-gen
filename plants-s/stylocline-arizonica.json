    "intro": "Stylocline arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona stylocline, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
