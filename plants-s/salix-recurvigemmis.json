    "intro": "Salix recurvigemmis, commonly known as the wavy-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
