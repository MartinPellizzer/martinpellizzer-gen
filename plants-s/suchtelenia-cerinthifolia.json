    "intro": "Suchtelenia cerinthifolia, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Suchtelenia cerinthifolia make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to botanical gardens and humid habitats."
