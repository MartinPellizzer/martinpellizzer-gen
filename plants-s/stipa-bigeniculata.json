    "intro": "Stipa bigeniculata, commonly known as the two-branched needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear clusters of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Stipa bigeniculata plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
