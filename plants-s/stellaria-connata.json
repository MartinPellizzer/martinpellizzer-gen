    "intro": "Stellaria connata, commonly known as the mountain starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Stellaria connata is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
