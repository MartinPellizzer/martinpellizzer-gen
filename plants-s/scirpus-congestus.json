    "intro": "Scirpus congestus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshes and along shorelines. Scirpus congestus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
