    "intro": "Saussurea hyperiophora, commonly known as the Tibetan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flower heads that resemble saffron threads, hence its common name. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
