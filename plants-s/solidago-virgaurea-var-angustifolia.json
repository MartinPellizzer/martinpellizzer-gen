    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in meadows and roadside areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
