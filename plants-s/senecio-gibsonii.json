It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowering period occurs during the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
