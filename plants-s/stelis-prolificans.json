    "intro": "Stelis prolificans, commonly known as the prolific orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces numerous small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters along its stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis prolificans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
