    "intro": "Sciaphila arfakiana, commonly known as the Arfak mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the highland regions of Indonesia. It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on mossy tree trunks or rocky substrates. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the moist air. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
