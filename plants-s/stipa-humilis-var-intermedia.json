    "intro": "Stipa humilis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
