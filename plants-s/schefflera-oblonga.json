    "intro": "Schefflera oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, oblong-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor settings."
