    "intro": "Siphonoglossa incerta, commonly known as the uncertain siphonogloss, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, tubular flowers in clusters. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
