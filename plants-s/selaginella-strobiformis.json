    "intro": "Selaginella strobiformis, commonly known as the strobiliferous spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spike-like strobila that bear sporangia. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique life cycle involving both gametophytic and sporophytic stages. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit, with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
