    "intro": "Stellaria pubera subsp. silvatica, commonly known as the forest starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to woodland habitats in Europe. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to compete for light and nutrients in dense vegetation."
