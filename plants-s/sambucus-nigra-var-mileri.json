    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. mileri, commonly known as the Miller's elderberry, is a variant of the elderberry plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple berries, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland areas. The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though they should be handled with care due to their potential toxicity when unripe."
