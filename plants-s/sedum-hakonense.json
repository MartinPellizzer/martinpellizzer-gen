    "intro": "Sedum hakonense, commonly known as the Arctic sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum hakonense is often found in rocky or sandy soils, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it a hardy and resilient species well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
