It is a perennial herb that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets. It is adapted to withstand high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions highlights its ecological significance in stabilizing shorelines and supporting biodiversity."
