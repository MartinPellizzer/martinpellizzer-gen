    "intro": "Spergularia rubra subsp. media, commonly known as the red sandrift, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in conditions of low nutrient availability. Its ability to withstand drought and high temperatures makes it a notable species in ecological studies of xerophytic vegetation."
