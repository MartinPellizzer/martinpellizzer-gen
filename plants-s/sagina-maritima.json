    "intro": "Sagina maritima, commonly known as beach sandpenny, is a small annual plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to salty, sandy soils and can withstand harsh coastal conditions. Sagina maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
