    "intro": "Sporobolus sindicus, commonly known as the Indian sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and wiry, fibrous stems that often form dense mats on sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments. Sporobolus sindicus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
