    "intro": "Sideroxylon boninense, commonly known as the Bonin ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
