    "intro": "Salacia gerrardii, commonly known as the Florida saltbush, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it tolerate saline soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds. Salacia gerrardii is often found in coastal areas and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
