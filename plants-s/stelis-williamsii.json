    "intro": "Stelis williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale green flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Stelis williamsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
