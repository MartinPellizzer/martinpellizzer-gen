    "intro": "Saxifraga rosularis, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form with dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in shades of pink, white, or purple, depending on the species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Saxifraga rosularis is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
