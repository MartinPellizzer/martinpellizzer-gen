    "intro": "Sicyos microcarpus var. haleakalaensis, commonly known as the Haleakala prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is adapted to the dry, volcanic soils of the Haleakala region, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid conditions. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
