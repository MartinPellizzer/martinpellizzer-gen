    "intro": "Saxifraga hieraciifolia f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved rockfoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
