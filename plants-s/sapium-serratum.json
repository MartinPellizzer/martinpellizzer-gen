    "intro": "Sapium serratum, commonly known as Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It features alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in catkin-like inflorescences. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release three winged seeds. The tree is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ornamental horticulture, though it can become invasive in some regions."
