    "intro": "Selliguea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant wall-rue, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on damp soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically small and clustered at the base of the leaves. Selliguea macrophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
