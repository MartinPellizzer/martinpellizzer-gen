    "intro": "Sorghastrum contractum, commonly known as black grama, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the Great Plains and southwestern regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Black grama is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. It plays an important role in native grassland ecosystems and is a key forage species for grazing animals."
