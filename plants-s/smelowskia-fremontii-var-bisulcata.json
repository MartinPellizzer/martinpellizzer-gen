    "intro": "Smelowskia fremontii var. bisulcata, commonly known as the Fremont's smelowskia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
