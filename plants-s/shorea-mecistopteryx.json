    "intro": "Shorea mecistopteryx, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree belonging to the Dipterocarpaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a crown that is often umbrella-shaped. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
