    "intro": "Sapium cassinefolium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
