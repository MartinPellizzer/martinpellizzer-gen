    "intro": "Selaginella camptostachys, commonly known as the clubmoss or spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense, mat-like clusters on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a spore-producing and a gametophyte stage. Selaginella camptostachys is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
