    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor var. puberula, commonly known as the slender dock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features upright, grass-like stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Sanguisorba minor var. puberula is well-suited for moist soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
