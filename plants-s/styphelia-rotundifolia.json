    "intro": "Styphelia rotundifolia, commonly known as the wintergreen heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal forests of North America and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Styphelia rotundifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is an important component of the ecosystem, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
