It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, colorful flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to harsh coastal environments.
