    "intro": "Stelis barbae, commonly known as the beard orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Stelis barbae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
