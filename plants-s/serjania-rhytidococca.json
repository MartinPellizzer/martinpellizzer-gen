    "intro": "Serjania rhytidococca, commonly known as the rough-leaved serjania, is a small evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
