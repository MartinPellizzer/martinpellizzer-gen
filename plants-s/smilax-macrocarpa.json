    "intro": "Smilax macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, recurved spines. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, yellowish berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, serrated edge. Smilax macrocarpa is often found in moist woodlands and is known for its aggressive growth and ability to form dense thickets."
