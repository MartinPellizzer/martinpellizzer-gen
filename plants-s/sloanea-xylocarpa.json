    "intro": "Sloanea xylocarpa, commonly known as the redwood sloanea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Sloanea xylocarpa is valued for its durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
