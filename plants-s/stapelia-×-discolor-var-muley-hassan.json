    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 discolor var. muley-hassan, commonly known as the Muley Hassan Stapelia, is a hybrid succulent native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a slow growth rate. This variety is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and resilience in low-maintenance environments."
