    "intro": "Solanum ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Andean region of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries. The berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities."
