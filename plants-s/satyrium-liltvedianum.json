    "intro": "Satyrium liltvedianum, commonly known as the Liltved's orchid, is a rare and lesser-known orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate flowers that typically feature a combination of white, green, and purple hues. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it can thrive on decaying organic matter. Its morphology includes a slender stem with a single or few leaves and a showy floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species within the orchid family."
