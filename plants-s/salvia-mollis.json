    "intro": "Salvia mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy to the touch. The plant produces striking spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia mollis is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
