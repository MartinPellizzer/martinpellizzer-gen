It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow waters and has specialized leaves that aid in trapping prey. Its flowers are small and often white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Schizoglossum bilamellatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
