    "intro": "Symplocos havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's waxleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are elliptical, thick, and have a waxy texture, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
