    "intro": "Stellaria neglecta, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a small annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens, and reaches heights of up to 20 centimeters. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals arranged star-like. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Stellaria neglecta is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
