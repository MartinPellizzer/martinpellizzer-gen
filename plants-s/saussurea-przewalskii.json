    "intro": "Saussurea przewalskii, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh climate. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a symbol of the Tibetan region's biodiversity."
