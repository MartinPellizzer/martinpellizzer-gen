    "intro": "Stenandrium pohlii var. breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed stenandrium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
