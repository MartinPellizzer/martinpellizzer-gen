    "intro": "Selaginella hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of North America. This plant is a primitive vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry. It has a low-growing, creeping habit with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Selaginella hildebrandtii typically produces spore-bearing structures called strobila on its stems, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
