    "intro": "Senecio canabyi, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Senecio canabyi is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
