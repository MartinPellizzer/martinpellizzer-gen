    "intro": "Stipa caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Stipa caucasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine, delicate foliage."
