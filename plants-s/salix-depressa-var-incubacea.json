    "intro": "Salix depressa var. incubacea, commonly known as the dwarf willow or creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit, with slender, often red-tinged stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. Due to its low profile and adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic animals."
