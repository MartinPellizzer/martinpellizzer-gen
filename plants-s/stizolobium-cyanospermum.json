    "intro": "Stizolobium cyanospermum, commonly known as the blue-seed legume, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Its seeds are encased in a hard, blue-black pod, which gives the species its common name. Stizolobium cyanospermum is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
