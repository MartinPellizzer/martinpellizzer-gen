    "intro": "Sinarundinaria macclureana, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or shaded soil in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Sinarundinaria macclureana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
