It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and woody stems, often growing as a shrub or small tree. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while the fruit is a small, fleshy capsule containing several seeds."
