    "intro": "Spergularia rengifoi, commonly known as the red sandras, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, bright red flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming low mats or cushions to conserve moisture. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Spergularia rengifoi is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in extreme climates."
