It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are often divided into segments with a rough, scaly texture that gives it its common name. Sarcopteryx squamosa is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often seen growing near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
