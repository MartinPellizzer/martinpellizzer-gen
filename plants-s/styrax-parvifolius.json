    "intro": "Styrax parvifolius, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, round, reddish-brown fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Styrax parvifolius is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and compact growth habit."
