    "intro": "Schismatoglottis grabowskii, commonly known as the Grabowsky's schismatoglottis, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa, specifically found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and inflorescence. Its leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers, which are usually pale green or white, are small and clustered, typical of many orchids in the Schismatoglottis genus."
