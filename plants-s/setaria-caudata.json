    "intro": "Setaria caudata, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies. Setaria caudata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
