    "intro": "Sphenogyne gracilis, commonly known as the slender sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sphenogyneaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its botanical features include finely divided leaves and a unique reproductive structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sphenogyne gracilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
