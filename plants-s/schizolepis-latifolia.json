    "intro": "Schizolepis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf schizolepis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Schizolepis latifolia is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insects and birds."
