    "intro": "Scutellaria utriculata, commonly known as the bladderflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique feature is the presence of inflated, bladder-like structures at the base of the leaves, which are thought to aid in water retention. Scutellaria utriculata thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas."
