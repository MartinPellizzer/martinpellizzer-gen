    "intro": "Spiranthes ceracifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and long, spiraling inflorescences that bear numerous small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its delicate appearance and unique floral structure make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
