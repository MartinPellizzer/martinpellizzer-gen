    "intro": "Sambucus williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Sambucus williamsii is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
