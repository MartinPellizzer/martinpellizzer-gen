It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
