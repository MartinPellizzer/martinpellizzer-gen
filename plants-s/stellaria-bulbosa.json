    "intro": "Stellaria bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in disturbed or rocky soils. Stellaria bulbosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
