    "intro": "Senegalia catechu, commonly known as Indian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are compound and finely divided. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. The bark and pods of Senegalia catechu have been used traditionally for their tannin content and various medicinal properties."
