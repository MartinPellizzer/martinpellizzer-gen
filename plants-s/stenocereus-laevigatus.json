    "intro": "Stenocereus laevigatus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. Stenocereus laevigatus is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited to arid environments."
