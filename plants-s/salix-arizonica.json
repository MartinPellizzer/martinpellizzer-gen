    "intro": "Salix arizonica, commonly known as Arizona willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in the spring, and its bark is often covered in a layer of white, woolly hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found along stream banks and in rocky soils. The species is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of riparian ecosystems in its native range."
