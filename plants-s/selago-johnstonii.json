    "intro": "Selago johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's selago, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Selago johnstonii is typically found in open areas such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
