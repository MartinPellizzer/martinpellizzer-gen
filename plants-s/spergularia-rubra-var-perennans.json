    "intro": "Spergularia rubra var. perennans, commonly known as the perennial sandflat grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, pink to red flowers in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. It has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. This variety is distinguished from the annual form by its longer lifespan and ability to persist through multiple growing seasons."
