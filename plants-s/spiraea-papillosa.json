    "intro": "Spiraea papillosa, commonly known as the silky spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Spiraea papillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in garden settings."
