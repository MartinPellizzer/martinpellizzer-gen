    "intro": "Sagina lamyi, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters near the base of the plant. Sagina lamyi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and high-altitude ecosystems."
