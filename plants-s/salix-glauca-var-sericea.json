    "intro": "Salix glauca var. sericea, commonly known as silky willow, is a variant of the silky poplar native to North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
