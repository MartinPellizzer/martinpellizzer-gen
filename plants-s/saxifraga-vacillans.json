    "intro": "Saxifraga vacillans, commonly known as the wavering saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga vacillans is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes, where it contributes to the unique flora of alpine ecosystems."
