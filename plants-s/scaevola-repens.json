    "intro": "Scaevola repens, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers with blue or violet petals that open in the morning. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Scaevola repens is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a common sight along coastal dunes and shores."
