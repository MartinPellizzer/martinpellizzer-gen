    "intro": "Sempervivum ballsii, commonly known as the Campion Sempervivum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues along the edges. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Sempervivum ballsii is also notable for its resilience, surviving in harsh conditions and requiring minimal water once established."
