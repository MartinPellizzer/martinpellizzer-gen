    "intro": "Symplocos cagayanensis, commonly known as the Cagayan waxtree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
