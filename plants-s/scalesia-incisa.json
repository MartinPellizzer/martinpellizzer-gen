    "intro": "Scalesia incisa, commonly known as the endemic tree of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, yellow-orange capitula that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in the humid, coastal environments of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Scalesia incisa is also notable for its role in the evolution of reproductive strategies in island flora."
