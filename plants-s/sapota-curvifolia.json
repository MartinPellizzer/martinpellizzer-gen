    "intro": "Sapota curvifolia, commonly known as the Mexican sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often lobed or deeply veined. The tree produces smooth, yellow or orange fruits with a sweet, creamy pulp that resembles a hybrid of a persimmon and a sapodilla. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, typically blooming before the leaves emerge. The plant is valued for its edible fruit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage."
