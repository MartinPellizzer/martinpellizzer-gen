    "intro": "Schoenefeldia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its unique, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to its rainforest environment and its role in ecological studies of epiphytic flora."
