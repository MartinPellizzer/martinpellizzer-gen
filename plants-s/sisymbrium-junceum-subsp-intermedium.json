    "intro": "Sisymbrium junceum subsp. intermedium, commonly known as intermediate broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and chloroplasts, making it a parasitic plant that derives nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. This species typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, often in disturbed soils or open habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as siliques. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions but can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
