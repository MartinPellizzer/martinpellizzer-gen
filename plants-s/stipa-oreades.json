    "intro": "Stipa oreades, commonly known as mountain needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Stipa oreades plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
