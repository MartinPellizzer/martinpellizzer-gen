It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months."
