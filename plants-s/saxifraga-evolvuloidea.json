    "intro": "Saxifraga evolvuloidea, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats. Saxifraga evolvuloidea is adapted to cold climates and is a hardy species capable of surviving extreme temperature fluctuations."
