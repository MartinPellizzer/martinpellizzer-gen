    "intro": "Sarothamnus vulgaris var. leiostylos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thornstep, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant features slender, often thorny stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. This variety is distinguished by its more elongated and narrow leaves compared to the typical form of Sarothamnus vulgaris."
