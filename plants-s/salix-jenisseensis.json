    "intro": "Salix jenisseensis, commonly known as the Yenisei willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of Asia, particularly along the Yenisei River. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, cold environments and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and tundra-like habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
