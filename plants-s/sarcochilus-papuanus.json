    "intro": "Sarcochilus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan sarcochilus, is an epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with thick, leathery leaves that help store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
