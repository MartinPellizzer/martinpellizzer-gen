    "intro": "Schefflera pallens, commonly known as the white schefflera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of palmate leaves, which are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor decoration due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
