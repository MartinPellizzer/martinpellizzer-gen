It is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and basal leaves that are broadly kidney-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry climates. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
