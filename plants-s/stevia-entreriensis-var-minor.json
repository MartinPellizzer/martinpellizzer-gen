    "intro": "Stevia entreriensis var. minor, commonly known as lesser stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for containing high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Due to its low water requirements and hardy nature, it is often grown as a drought-tolerant ornamental and medicinal plant."
