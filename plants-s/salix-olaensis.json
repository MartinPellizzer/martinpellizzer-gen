    "intro": "Salix olaensis, commonly known as the Olan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. Salix olaensis is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insect species."
