    "intro": "Sclerolaena convexula, commonly known as the woolly star, is a small, flowering shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sclerolaena convexula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
