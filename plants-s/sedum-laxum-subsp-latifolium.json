It features fleshy, upright stems and thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for arid environments."
