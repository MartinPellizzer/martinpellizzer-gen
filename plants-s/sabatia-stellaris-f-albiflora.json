    "intro": "Sabatia stellaris f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered starflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, white petals that contrast with its green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale or white flowers, which set it apart from the more commonly seen pink or red varieties of Sabatia stellaris."
