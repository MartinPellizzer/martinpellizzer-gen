    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris subsp. flevensis, commonly known as the Dutch marsh reed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and lake margins. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
