    "intro": "Sedum viviparum, commonly known as the live-bearing stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are arranged in tight clusters and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its unique reproductive method involves the production of live young plants, which grow directly from the parent plant's stems. This adaptation allows it to spread efficiently in its harsh, rocky habitat."
