    "intro": "Stelis simacoensis, commonly known as the Simaco orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
