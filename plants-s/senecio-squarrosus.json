The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
