    "intro": "Schoenorchis pachyacris, commonly known as the thick-stemmed lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form colonies over time. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
