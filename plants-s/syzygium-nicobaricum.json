    "intro": "Syzygium nicobaricum, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Nicobar Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of sandalwood oil. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
