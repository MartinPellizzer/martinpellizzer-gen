    "intro": "Somerauera quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leafed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being more prominent and containing ovules that develop into seeds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
