    "intro": "Symplocos interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted evergreen, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Symplocos interrupta thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
