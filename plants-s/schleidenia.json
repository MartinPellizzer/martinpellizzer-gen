    "intro": "Schleidenia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or oval, with hairy surfaces, and produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. Schleidenia species are often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. They are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their delicate foliage and flowering structure."
