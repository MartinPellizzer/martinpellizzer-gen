    "intro": "Selaginella minahasae, commonly known as the Mindanao spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Selaginella minahasae plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
