    "intro": "Salix cinnamomea, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine or wetland habitats. Salix cinnamomea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
