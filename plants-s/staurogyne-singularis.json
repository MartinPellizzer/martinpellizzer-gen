    "intro": "Staurogyne singularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterhyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged oppositely along its square, branching stems. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in clusters at the leaf axils, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Staurogyne singularis is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
