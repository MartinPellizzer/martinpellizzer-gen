    "intro": "Salix villosa var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
