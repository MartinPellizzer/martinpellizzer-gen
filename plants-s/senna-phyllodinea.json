    "intro": "Senna phyllodinea, commonly known as the silky senna, is a perennial shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a long, slender pod that splits open when mature. Senna phyllodinea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
