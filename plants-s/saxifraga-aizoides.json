    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoides, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, pink or white, and are borne on slender, branching stems. Saxifraga aizoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
