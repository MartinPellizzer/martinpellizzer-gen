    "intro": "Sokolofia, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers that resemble flames, making it a visually striking addition to any garden. The plant produces showy, orchid-like blooms that typically appear during the warmer months. Its foliage consists of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Sokolofia thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
