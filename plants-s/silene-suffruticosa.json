    "intro": "Silene suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene suffruticosa is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
