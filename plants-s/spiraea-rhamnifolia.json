    "intro": "Spiraea rhamnifolia, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features arching stems covered in small, oval leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream sides. Spiraea rhamnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
