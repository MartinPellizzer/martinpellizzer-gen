    "intro": "Saccharum pedicellare, commonly known as the clustered bamboo grass, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and long, slender leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively in suitable environments. While not widely cultivated for food, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
