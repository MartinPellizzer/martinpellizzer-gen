    "intro": "Sisymbrium caespitosum, commonly known as clustered winter cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sisymbrium caespitosum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
