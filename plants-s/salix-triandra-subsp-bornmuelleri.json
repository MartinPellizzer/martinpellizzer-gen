    "intro": "Salix triandra subsp. bornmuelleri, commonly known as the African willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its pollination process. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
