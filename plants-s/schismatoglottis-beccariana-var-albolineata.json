    "intro": "Schismatoglottis beccariana var. albolineata, commonly known as the white-lined schismatoglottis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
