It has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
