It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it withstand salty air and strong winds. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale green, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
