    "intro": "Saxifraga poluniniana var. mucronata, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
