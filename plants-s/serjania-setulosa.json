    "intro": "Serjania setulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or the spiny serjania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lythraceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Serjania setulosa is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been used in traditional crafts and musical instruments."
