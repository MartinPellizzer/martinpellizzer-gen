    "intro": "Stelis multiflora, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant produces multiple small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Stelis multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
