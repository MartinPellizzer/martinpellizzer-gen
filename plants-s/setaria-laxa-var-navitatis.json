    "intro": "Setaria laxa var. navitatis, commonly known as Navitas panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Navitas panic grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
