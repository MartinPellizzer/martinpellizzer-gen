    "intro": "Scepocarpus, commonly known as the sycamore or plane tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often deeply lobed, and its distinctive, flat, winged fruits called samaras. The trees are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves in the autumn, and can grow to be quite tall with a broad, spreading canopy. They are native to various regions in Asia and are often found in moist, fertile soils. Scepocarpus species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are commonly used in landscaping and urban environments."
