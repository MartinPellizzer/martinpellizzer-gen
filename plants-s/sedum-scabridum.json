    "intro": "Sedum scabridum, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Sedum scabridum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
