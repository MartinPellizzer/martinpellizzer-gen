    "intro": "Sedum viscosum, commonly known as sticky stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Sedum viscosum is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ground cover."
