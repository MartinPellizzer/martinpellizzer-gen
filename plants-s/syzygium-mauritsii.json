It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruit exterior, which gives it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Syzygium mauritsii thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
