    "intro": "Sanidophyllum cumulicola, commonly known as the cloud forest spurge, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky or forested slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
