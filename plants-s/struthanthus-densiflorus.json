    "intro": "Struthanthus densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Struthanthus densiflorus is adapted to rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
