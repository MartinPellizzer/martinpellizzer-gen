    "intro": "Scleria terrestris var. hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. It is characterized by its bulbous base, which stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal wet environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
