    "intro": "Schoenoplectus erectus subsp. sinuatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often sinuous in appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
