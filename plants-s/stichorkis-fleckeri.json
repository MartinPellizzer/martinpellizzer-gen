    "intro": "Stichorkis fleckeri, commonly known as the Flecker's stichorkis, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to crimson. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stichorkis fleckeri is considered a species of conservation concern."
