    "intro": "Salix aria, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, often yellowish or reddish leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, woody fruits. Salix aria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
