    "intro": "Sphalmanthus crassus, commonly known as the thick-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. Sphalmanthus crassus typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
