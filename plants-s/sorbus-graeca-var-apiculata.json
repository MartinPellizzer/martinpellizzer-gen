    "intro": "Sorbus graeca var. apiculata, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring, followed by small, red berries in the autumn. The leaves are elliptical, with a finely toothed margin, and turn a striking yellow or orange in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. This species is valued for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
