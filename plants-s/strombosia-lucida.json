    "intro": "Strombosia lucida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, white, ghost-like flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Strombosia lucida has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
