    "intro": "Scirpus pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and its tall, flowering spikes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus pacificus plays a vital role in providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
