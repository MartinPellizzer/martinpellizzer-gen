    "intro": "Stipa setigera f. versicolor, commonly known as the variable feathergrass, is a variant of the slender wheatgrass species. It is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of the Tibetan Plateau. The plant is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, arid environments. Its foliage exhibits a striking color variation, with leaves ranging from green to bluish-gray, depending on environmental conditions. This variation in leaf color makes it a distinctive and visually appealing plant in its native habitat."
