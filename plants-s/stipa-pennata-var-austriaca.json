    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
