It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical bean-like pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a resilient species in harsh environments. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds when mature."
