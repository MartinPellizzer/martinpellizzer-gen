    "intro": "Solanum blattarioides, commonly known as the leafy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, though they are toxic and not edible. Solanum blattarioides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and horticultural research."
