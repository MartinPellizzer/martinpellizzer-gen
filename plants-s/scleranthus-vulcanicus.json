    "intro": "Scleranthus vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic thornweed, is a flowering plant native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh, arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a rare and resilient species."
