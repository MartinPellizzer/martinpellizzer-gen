    "intro": "Setaria phragmitoides, commonly known as the flatgrass or narrowleaf flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it an important pioneer species in wetland ecosystems."
