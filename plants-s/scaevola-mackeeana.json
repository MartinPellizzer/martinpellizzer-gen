    "intro": "Scaevola mackeeana, commonly known as the Mackee's fanflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact, fleshy stems and clusters of small, bright blue or purple flowers. The plant produces its flowers in late winter to early spring, and the petals are typically arranged in a symmetrical, fan-like pattern. Scaevola mackeeana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with small leaves that reduce water loss. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
