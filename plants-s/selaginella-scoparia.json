    "intro": "Selaginella scoparia, commonly known as the spiky clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Selaginella scoparia is also noted for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
