    "intro": "Swintonia robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's swintonia, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a striking purple or red underside, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is a subject of conservation interest."
