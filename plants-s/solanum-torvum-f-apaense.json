    "intro": "Solanum torvum f. apaense, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with thin, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its foliage and fruits contain alkaloids, making it potentially poisonous to humans and animals."
