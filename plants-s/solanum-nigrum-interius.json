    "intro": "Solanum nigrum interius, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into spherical, black berries when mature. These berries are toxic when unripe but can be edible when fully ripe, though they are not commonly consumed due to their bitter taste and potential for confusion with other similar species. Solanum nigrum interius is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas."
