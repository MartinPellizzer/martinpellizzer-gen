    "intro": "Salix lanceolata var. coetanea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long, with a pointed tip and a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental planting."
