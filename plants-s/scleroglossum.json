    "intro": "Scleroglossum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are characterized by their compact, often rock-dwelling growth habit and their ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage, while the flowers are small and often clustered in inflorescences. Scleroglossum species are native to regions of southern Africa, where they are found in rocky outcrops and dry hillsides. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject for botanical study."
