    "intro": "Salvia fruticulosa, commonly known as winter sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage and produces showy, violet-blue flower spikes during the winter months. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia fruticulosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
