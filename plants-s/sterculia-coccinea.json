    "intro": "Sterculia coccinea, commonly known as the red sterculia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in native habitats. The plant is also valued for its hard timber and historical use in traditional practices."
