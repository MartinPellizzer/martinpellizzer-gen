    "intro": "Swainsona galegifolia, commonly known as the yellow trumpet bush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Swainsona galegifolia is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert environments."
