    "intro": "Schizaea papuana, commonly known as the Papuan climbing fern, is a member of the family Schizaeaceae. It is a rhizomatous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive, creeping stem that allows it to spread along the ground or climb on other vegetation. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to several meters. Schizaea papuana is characterized by its sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns."
