    "intro": "Sium filifolium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and stream banks in North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root system is often harvested for culinary use, though it can be toxic if not prepared properly. Sium filifolium plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
