    "intro": "Scorpiurus vermiculatus var. spinosus, commonly known as the spiny false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its stems are covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced spines compared to the typical form of Scorpiurus vermiculatus."
