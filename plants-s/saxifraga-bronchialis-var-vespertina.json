    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis var. vespertina, commonly known as the evening saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, which help it store water in harsh environments. It is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
