    "intro": "Statice congesta, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. Statice congesta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
