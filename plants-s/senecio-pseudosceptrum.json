    "intro": "Senecio pseudosceptrum, commonly known as the false crown of thorns, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, spiny foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
