    "intro": "Saussurea otophylla, commonly known as the Alpine helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Saussurea otophylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climatic conditions."
