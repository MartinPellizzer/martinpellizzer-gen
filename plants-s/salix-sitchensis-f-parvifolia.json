    "intro": "Salix sitchensis f. parvifolia, commonly known as the Sitka willow, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more delicate than those of the typical species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
