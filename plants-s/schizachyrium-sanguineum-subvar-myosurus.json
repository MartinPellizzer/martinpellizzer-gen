    "intro": "Schizachyrium sanguineum subvar. myosurus, commonly known as redside grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its reddish tinge on the leaf blades and culms, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
