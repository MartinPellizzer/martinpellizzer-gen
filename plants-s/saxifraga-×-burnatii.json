    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 burnatii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
