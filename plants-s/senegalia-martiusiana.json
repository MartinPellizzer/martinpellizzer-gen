    "intro": "Senegalia martiusiana, commonly known as the whitebrush acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are usually reduced to spines, a feature common in xerophytic plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Senegalia martiusiana plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
