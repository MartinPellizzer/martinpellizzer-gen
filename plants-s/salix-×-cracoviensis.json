It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and adaptability to various soil types."
