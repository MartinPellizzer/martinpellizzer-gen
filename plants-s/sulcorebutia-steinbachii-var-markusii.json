    "intro": "Sulcorebutia steinbachii var. markusii, commonly known as the Markus Sulcorebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a slightly woolly texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in spring. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
