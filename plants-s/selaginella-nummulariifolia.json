    "intro": "Selaginella nummulariifolia, commonly known as the dollar plant or money plant, is a species of spiky, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, coin-shaped leaves that are tightly clustered around its central stem, giving it a compact, rosette-like appearance. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Selaginella nummulariifolia is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is often used in traditional medicine."
