    "intro": "Stylidium tenuicarpum, commonly known as the slender-fruited triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive trigger mechanism that aids in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, bright orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in arid conditions. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when touched, a unique adaptation for its environment."
