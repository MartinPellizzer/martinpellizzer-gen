    "intro": "Sida neglecta, commonly known as smallleaf sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread easily. Sida neglecta is known for its hardy nature and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
