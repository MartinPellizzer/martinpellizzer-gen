It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often display a distinctive purple or reddish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with pale pink to white petals and a prominent, spurred lip. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.
