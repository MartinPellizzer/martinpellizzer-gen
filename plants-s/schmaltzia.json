It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plants typically have smooth, waxy leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Schmaltzia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture."
