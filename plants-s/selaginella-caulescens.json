    "intro": "Selaginella caulescens, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the tips of the stems. Selaginella caulescens is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its historical significance in the study of plant evolution."
