    "intro": "Stapelia reclinata, commonly known as the hanging stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several feet in length, often trailing or hanging from supports. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, waxy texture. These flowers bloom in late winter to early spring and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Stapelia reclinata is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright light and well-draining soil."
