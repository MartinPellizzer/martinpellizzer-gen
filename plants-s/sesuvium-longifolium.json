    "intro": "Sesuvium longifolium, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to coastal dunes and rocky shores. Sesuvium longifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion along the coast."
