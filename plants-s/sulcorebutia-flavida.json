    "intro": "Sulcorebutia flavida, commonly known as the yellow stone cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its fleshy stems. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green or blue-green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
