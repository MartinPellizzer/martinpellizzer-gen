It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, red, woody fruits. Strychnos glabra is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, which make it a plant of both botanical and cautionary interest. Its structure and chemical composition reflect adaptations to its ecological niche in tropical environments."
