    "intro": "Stevia, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, green leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Its flowers are typically white or yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stevia is widely used as a sugar substitute due to its intense sweetness and zero caloric content."
