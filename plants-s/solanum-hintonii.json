    "intro": "Solanum hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Solanum hintonii is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
