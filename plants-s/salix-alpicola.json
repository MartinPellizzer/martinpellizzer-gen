    "intro": "Salix alpicola, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Salix alpicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
