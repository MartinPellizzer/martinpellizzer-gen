It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
