It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. It has small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
