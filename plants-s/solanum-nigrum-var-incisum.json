    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf black nightshade, is a variant of the black nightshade species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which turn from yellow to black as they mature. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing solanine and other alkaloids. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides."
