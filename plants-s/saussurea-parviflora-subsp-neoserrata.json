    "intro": "Saussurea parviflora subsp. neoserrata, commonly known as the Tibetan cloud flower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
