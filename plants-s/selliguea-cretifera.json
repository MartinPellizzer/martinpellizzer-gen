    "intro": "Selliguea cretifera, commonly known as the crested liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rosette-like growth form and the presence of a central ridge or crest on its thallus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its structure consists of leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Selliguea cretifera plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
