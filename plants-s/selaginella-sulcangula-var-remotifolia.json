    "intro": "Selaginella sulcangula var. remotifolia, commonly known as the remote-leaved spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive morphology. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features creeping stems with whorled leaves that are usually narrow and linear. Its sporophytes produce spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are arranged in clusters. This variety is noted for its unique leaf arrangement and is of interest in botanical studies due to its evolutionary significance."
