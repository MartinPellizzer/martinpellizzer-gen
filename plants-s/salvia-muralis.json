    "intro": "Salvia muralis, commonly known as the wall sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Salvia muralis is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
