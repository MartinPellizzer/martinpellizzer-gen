    "intro": "Schefflera parvifoliolata, commonly known as the small-leaved umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with multiple stems that branch out from the base. The plant produces small, clustered, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are thick, glossy, and have a distinctive umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets. Schefflera parvifoliolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
