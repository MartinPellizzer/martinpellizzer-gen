    "intro": "Senecillis tsangchanensis, commonly known as the Tsangchanensis Senecillis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
