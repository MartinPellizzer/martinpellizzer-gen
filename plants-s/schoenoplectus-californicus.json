    "intro": "Schoenoplectus californicus, commonly known as California bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer. This plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant plays a vital role in providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species."
