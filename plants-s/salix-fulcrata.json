    "intro": "Salix fulcrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. The bark of Salix fulcrata is often smooth and light gray, and it can be used in traditional herbal practices."
