It is characterized by its fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum reniforme is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid environments."
