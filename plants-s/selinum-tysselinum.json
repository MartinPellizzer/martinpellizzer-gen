    "intro": "Selinum tysselinum, commonly known as the common parsley weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, celery, and dill, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a long flowering period, usually from spring to early autumn, and produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. The plant is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
