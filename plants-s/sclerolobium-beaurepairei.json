It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, feather-like leaflets. Its most striking feature is its bright yellow, flame-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
