    "intro": "Salix morrisonicola var. takasagoalpina, commonly known as the Takasago alpine willow, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or whitish bloom. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
