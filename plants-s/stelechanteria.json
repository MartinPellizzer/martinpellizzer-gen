    "intro": "Stelechanteria, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and are often found growing on rocks or in rocky soil. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Stelechanteria species are native to regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. They are adapted to harsh, dry environments and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
