It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves arranged in a compact rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
