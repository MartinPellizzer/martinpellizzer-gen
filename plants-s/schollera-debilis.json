    "intro": "Schollera debilis, commonly known as the dwarf schollera, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Schollera debilis is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
