    "intro": "Senecio basalticus, commonly known as the Basaltic Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the rocky, arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, adapting to nutrient-poor and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Senecio basalticus produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
