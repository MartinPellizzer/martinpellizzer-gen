    "intro": "Senna acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved senna, is a shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Senna acutifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
