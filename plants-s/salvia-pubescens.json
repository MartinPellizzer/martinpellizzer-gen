    "intro": "Salvia pubescens, commonly known as the Andean cat's tail, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often used in traditional Andean medicine for their purported healing properties. Its botanical name reflects its pubescent (hairy) foliage, a key identifying feature. Salvia pubescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
