It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is shrub-like, with woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, smooth texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories on the islands of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for its survival."
