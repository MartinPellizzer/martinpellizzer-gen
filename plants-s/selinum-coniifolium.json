    "intro": "Selinum coniifolium, commonly known as the cow parsley or queen anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and its umbel-shaped flower clusters that resemble a lace pattern. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are white with a single purple or red flower in the center, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Selinum coniifolium is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
