    "intro": "Saxifraga nanella var. glabrisepala, commonly known as the glabrous-sepal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually hairy but become smooth (glabrous) on the sepals, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five to seven sepals that are short and often glabrous. It is a hardy species that is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
