It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Salacia litseifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
