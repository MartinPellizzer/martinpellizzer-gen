It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, three-lobed\u84b4\u679c, which contain numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth rate. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
