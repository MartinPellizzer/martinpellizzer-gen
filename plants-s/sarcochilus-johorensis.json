    "intro": "Sarcochilus johorensis, commonly known as the Johore Sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, which is essential for survival in its humid, shaded environment. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Sarcochilus johorensis is a rare and endangered species, threatened by habitat destruction and over-collection."
