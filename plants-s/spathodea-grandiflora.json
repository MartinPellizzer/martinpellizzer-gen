    "intro": "Spathodea grandiflora, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a striking tropical tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, flame-red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters within the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its fast growth and ability to provide shade in tropical landscapes."
