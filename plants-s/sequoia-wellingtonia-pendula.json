    "intro": "Sequoia wellingtonia pendula, commonly known as the weeping giant sequoia, is a rare and striking variant of the Wellingtonia tree. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop like curtains, giving it a unique and dramatic appearance. Native to the western United States, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The tree has thick, fibrous bark that provides protection against fires and pests. Its foliage consists of dark green, needle-like leaves that provide year-round coverage and contribute to its ornamental value."
