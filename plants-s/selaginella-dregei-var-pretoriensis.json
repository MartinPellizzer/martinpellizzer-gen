    "intro": "Selaginella dregei var. pretoriensis, commonly known as the Pretoria spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to southern Africa. It features a dense rosette of narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clay soils. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
