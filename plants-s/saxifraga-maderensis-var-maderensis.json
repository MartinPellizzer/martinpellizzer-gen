    "intro": "Saxifraga maderensis var. maderensis, commonly known as the Madeira saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Azores. It features rosettes of basal leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal or alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
