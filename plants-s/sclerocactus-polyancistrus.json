    "intro": "Sclerocactus polyancistrus, commonly known as the mountain cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant has small, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems during the spring. This species is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats."
