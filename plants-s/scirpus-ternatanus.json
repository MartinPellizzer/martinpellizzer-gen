    "intro": "Scirpus ternatanus, commonly known as the three-awned bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are usually reddish-brown in color, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Scirpus ternatanus plays an important role in providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species."
