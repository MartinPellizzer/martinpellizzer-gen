    "intro": "Schizogramma, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often ribbed or veined, and they produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color. Schizogramma species are often found in woodland or shady areas, growing in moist, well-drained soils. They are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphological features and ecological roles."
