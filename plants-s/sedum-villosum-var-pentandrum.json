    "intro": "Sedum villosum var. pentandrum, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an excellent addition to low-maintenance landscapes."
