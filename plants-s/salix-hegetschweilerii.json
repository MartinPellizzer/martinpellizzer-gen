    "intro": "Salix hegetschweilerii, commonly known as the Hegetschweiler's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically a dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its adaptability to harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
