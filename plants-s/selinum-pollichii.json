    "intro": "Selinum pollichii, commonly known as the pollichii garlic chives, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, grass-like leaves that emit a strong garlic scent. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ornamental and culinary use. Selinum pollichii is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
