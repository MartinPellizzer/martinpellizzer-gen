    "intro": "Solanum chillagoense, commonly known as the Chillago nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, with five petals, and it produces small, spherical berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
