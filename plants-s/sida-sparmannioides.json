    "intro": "Sida sparmannioides, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with woody stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Sida sparmannioides is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
