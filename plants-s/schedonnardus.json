    "intro": "Schedonnardus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside, which gives the plant its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
