    "intro": "Siphocampylus subcarnosus, commonly known as the hairy leaf siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features elongated, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Siphocampylus subcarnosus is typically found in alpine environments, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
