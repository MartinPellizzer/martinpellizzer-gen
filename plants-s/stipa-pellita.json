    "intro": "Stipa pellita, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and distinctive, airy plumes that give it a delicate appearance. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Stipa pellita has a fibrous root system and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
