    "intro": "Salix aurita var. pumila, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves covered in a dense, white pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically flowers in early spring. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as streambanks and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
