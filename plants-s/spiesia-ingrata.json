    "intro": "Spiesia ingrata, commonly known as the bitter prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its fruit, often called a \"tuna,\" is edible but has a sharp, acidic taste. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
