    "intro": "Siphocampylus westinianus, commonly known as the Westinian siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
