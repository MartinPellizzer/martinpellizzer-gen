    "intro": "Strychnos setosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and dark, glossy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Its berries are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are highly poisonous. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
