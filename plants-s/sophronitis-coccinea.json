    "intro": "Sophronitis coccinea, commonly known as the red orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a striking yellow lip, which are key features in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts for their beauty and rarity."
