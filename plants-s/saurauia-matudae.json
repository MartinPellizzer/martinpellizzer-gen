    "intro": "Saurauia matudae, commonly known as the Matudae's evergreen tree, is a species native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that attract various wildlife. Saurauia matudae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
