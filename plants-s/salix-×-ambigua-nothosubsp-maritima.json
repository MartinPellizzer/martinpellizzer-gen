    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ambigua nothosubsp. maritima, commonly known as the salt marsh willow, is a hybrid shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant thrives in brackish or saline soils, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and salt spray, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
