    "intro": "Saxifraga brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga brevifolia is often found in mountain tundra and is a common indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
