    "intro": "Spodiopogon sibiricus var. minor, commonly known as Siberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive feathery appearance due to its fine, branching structure. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
