    "intro": "Stanhopea jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's stanhopea, is a rare orchid species native to the Andes of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow with red and purple markings. The plant grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
