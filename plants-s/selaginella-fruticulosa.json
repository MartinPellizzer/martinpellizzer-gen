    "intro": "Selaginella fruticulosa, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically forms dense mats or cushions on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Selaginella fruticulosa is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
