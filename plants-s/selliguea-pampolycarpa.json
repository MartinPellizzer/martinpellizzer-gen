    "intro": "Selliguea pampolycarpa, commonly known as the Pampas liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in small, cup-like structures called sporocarps. Selliguea pampolycarpa plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
