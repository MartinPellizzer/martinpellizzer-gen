It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Botanically, it belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is noted for its unique morphological features and ecological significance."
