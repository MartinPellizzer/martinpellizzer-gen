    "intro": "Sticherus mathewsii var. major, commonly known as the giant sticherus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with cylindrical, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which are arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
