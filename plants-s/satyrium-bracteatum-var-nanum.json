    "intro": "Satyrium bracteatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf satyrium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. The varietal name 'nanum' refers to its diminutive size compared to the typical form of Satyrium bracteatum."
