    "intro": "Saussurea nuda var. oxyodonta, commonly known as the naked safflower, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high altitudes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated safflower species."
