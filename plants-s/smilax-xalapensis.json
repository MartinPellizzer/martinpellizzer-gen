    "intro": "Smilax xalapensis, commonly known as the Mexican catclaw, is a vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of spines, which are modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas. Smilax xalapensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
