    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. longirostra, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the mud. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
