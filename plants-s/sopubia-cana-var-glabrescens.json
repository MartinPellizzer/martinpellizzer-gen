    "intro": "Sopubia cana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sopubia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft hair. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland health."
