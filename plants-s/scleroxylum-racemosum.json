    "intro": "Scleroxylum racemosum, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical rainforest tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a slightly pubescent surface. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
