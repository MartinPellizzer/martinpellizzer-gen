    "intro": "Siphocampylus loxensis, commonly known as the Loxa mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The plant typically thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Siphocampylus loxensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
