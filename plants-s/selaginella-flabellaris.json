    "intro": "Selaginella flabellaris, commonly known as the basket moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a dense, moss-like appearance with closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a low, carpet-like structure. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella flabellaris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
