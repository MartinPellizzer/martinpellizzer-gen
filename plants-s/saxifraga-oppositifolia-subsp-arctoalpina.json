    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. arctoalpina, commonly known as the alpine pink, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and barren environments, often found on tundra and mountain slopes. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against cold and wind. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats."
