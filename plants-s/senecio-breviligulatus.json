    "intro": "Senecio breviligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features slender stems and narrow, linear leaves, with small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower structure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
