    "intro": "Scirpus medius, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It has upright, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of the stem, which are typically green or reddish in color. Its roots form a dense mat that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Scirpus medius is an important species for wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
