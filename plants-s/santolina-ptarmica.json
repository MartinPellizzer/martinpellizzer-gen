    "intro": "Santolina ptarmica, commonly known as wooly santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of silver-gray, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina ptarmica is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine."
