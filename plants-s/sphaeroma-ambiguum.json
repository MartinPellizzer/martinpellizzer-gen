    "intro": "Sphaeroma ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a layer of mucus. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead relying on its radula for feeding on algae and other marine vegetation. Its reproductive system is unique, with separate sexes and external fertilization. Sphaeroma ambiguum plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding and excretory activities."
