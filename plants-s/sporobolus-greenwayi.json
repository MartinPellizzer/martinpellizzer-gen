    "intro": "Sporobolus greenwayi, commonly known as greenway's dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a valuable plant for landscaping in dry regions."
