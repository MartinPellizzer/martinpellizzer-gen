    "intro": "Selaginella adunca subsp. albocincta, commonly known as the white-banded spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in harsh environments due to its adaptations such as succulence and desiccation tolerance."
