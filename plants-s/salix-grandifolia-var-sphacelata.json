    "intro": "Salix grandifolia var. sphacelata, commonly known as the broadleaf willow or the yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, often with a whitish or silvery underside. The plant produces catkins, which are the male flowers, and it is often found in moist, riparian habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil along waterways. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
