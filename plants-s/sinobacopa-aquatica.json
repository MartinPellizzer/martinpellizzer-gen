    "intro": "Sinobacopa aquatica, commonly known as water bacopa, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its small, opposite leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped. It produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating just above the water surface. Sinobacopa aquatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
