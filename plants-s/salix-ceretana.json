    "intro": "Salix ceretana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and is known for its medicinal uses due to the presence of salicin, a compound similar to aspirin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Salix ceretana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
