    "intro": "Scleranthus serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's-head or serpent's-bane, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Scleranthus serpentini is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
