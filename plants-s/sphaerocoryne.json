    "intro": "Sphaerocoryne, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are characterized by their distinctive, spiny, spherical seed heads. The leaves are usually narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. Sphaerocoryne species are known for their hardy nature and ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Their unique appearance makes them popular in horticulture, particularly in coastal gardens."
