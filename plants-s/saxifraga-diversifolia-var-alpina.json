    "intro": "Saxifraga diversifolia var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga diversifolia var. alpina is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it contributes to the unique flora of these ecosystems."
