    "intro": "Styrax obliquinervius, commonly known as the Chinese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Styrax obliquinervius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its fragrant blooms and attractive foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for temperate climates."
