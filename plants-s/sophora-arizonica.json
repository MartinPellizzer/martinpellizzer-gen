    "intro": "Sophora arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona thornless acacia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 10 to 20 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower clusters that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual display. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
