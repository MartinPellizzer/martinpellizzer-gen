It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, blue to violet flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Sisyrinchium chilense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
