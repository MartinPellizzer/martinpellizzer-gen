    "intro": "Secale cereale var. ancestrale, commonly known as ancient rye, is a wild variant of rye that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics compared to cultivated rye. It typically grows as a tall, grass-like plant with narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is known for its hardy nature, thriving in cooler climates and well-drained soils. Its seeds are smaller and more robust than those of domesticated rye, making them well-suited for harsh environments. This variety is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural improvement."
