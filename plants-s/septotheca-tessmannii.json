    "intro": "Septotheca tessmannii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and highly valued tree native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive red heartwood, which is prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant belongs to the family Burseraceae and is adapted to the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat. It has small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish flowers that are followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
