    "intro": "Sorghum eplicatum var. cereum, commonly known as wax sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive waxy coating on the leaves and stems, which provides a protective layer against drought and pests. The plant typically grows as an annual grass, reaching heights of up to 2 to 3 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a grayish-green coloration. The inflorescence consists of panicles that produce small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
