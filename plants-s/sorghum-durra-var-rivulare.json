    "intro": "Sorghum durra var. rivulare, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small-statured grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, sturdy stalks and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically used for animal feed or local consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for marginal agricultural lands. Its botanical features make it an important forage crop in arid and semi-arid environments."
