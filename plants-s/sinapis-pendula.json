    "intro": "Sinapis pendula, commonly known as the hanging mustard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its slender, drooping stems and small yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sinapis pendula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
