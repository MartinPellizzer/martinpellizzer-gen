    "intro": "Struthiola erecta var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved struthiola, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
