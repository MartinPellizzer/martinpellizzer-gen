    "intro": "Sarcococca nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal waxleaf, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
