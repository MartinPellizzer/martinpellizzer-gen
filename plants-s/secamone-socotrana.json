It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is adapted to the arid and rugged environment of Socotra, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Secamone socotrana is also notable for its role in the local ecosystem and its status as an endemic species."
