    "intro": "Salvia micrantha, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Salvia micrantha is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
