    "intro": "Salix dendroides, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a matte green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
