It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that transition into berries, typically ranging in color from yellow to red. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
