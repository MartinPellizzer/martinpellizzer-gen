    "intro": "Sieglingia flava, commonly known as the yellow sigil orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling sigils or symbols. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sieglingia flava is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
