    "intro": "Spiranthes parasitica var. valerioi, commonly known as the Valerio's Ladies' Tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. This variety is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
