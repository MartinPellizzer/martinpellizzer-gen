    "intro": "Senecio sessilis, commonly known as the sessile groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are generally sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. Senecio sessilis is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with a compact growth form and a long flowering period."
