    "intro": "Siphocampylus bichromatus, commonly known as the two-colored siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clustered umbels. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
