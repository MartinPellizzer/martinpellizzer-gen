It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as limestone soils and open woodlands. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots and compact growth habit make it well adapted to arid environments."
