    "intro": "Selliguea proteus, commonly known as the giant moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. Selliguea proteus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
