    "intro": "Semnostachya kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu spikegrass, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the mountainous regions of Borneo, particularly on Mount Kinabalu. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many grass species. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change. Its unique ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems makes it an important subject for botanical and conservation studies."
