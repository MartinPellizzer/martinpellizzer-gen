    "intro": "Sporobolus aequiglumis, commonly known as the plains dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Sporobolus aequiglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
