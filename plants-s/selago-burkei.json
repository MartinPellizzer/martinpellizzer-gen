    "intro": "Selago burkei, commonly known as the mountain sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. Selago burkei thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of its native ecosystem."
