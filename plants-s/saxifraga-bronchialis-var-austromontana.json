The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, usually blooming from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathland environments. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
