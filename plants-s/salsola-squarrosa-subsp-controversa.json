    "intro": "Salsola squarrosa subsp. controversa, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. The subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, squarrose (spread-out) leaf arrangement, which distinguishes it from other members of the genus."
