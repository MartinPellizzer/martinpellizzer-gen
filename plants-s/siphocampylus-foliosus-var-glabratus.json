It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its glabrous, lanceolate leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
