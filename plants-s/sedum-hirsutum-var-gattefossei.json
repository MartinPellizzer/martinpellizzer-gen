    "intro": "Sedum hirsutum var. gattefossei, commonly known as the Gattefosse stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. This variety is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
