    "intro": "Schefflera carrii, commonly known as the Carri's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which give it a distinctive and lush appearance. The plant features compound leaves with multiple pairs of opposite leaflets, often arranged in a radiating pattern around a central stem. Schefflera carrii produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
