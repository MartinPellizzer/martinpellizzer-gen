    "intro": "Sarcostemma arenarium, commonly known as the sandstone milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care."
