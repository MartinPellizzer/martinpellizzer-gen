    "intro": "Salix seemanii, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, cold environments. It is often found in moist, rocky soils and is a common species in alpine and subalpine zones. Salix seemanii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
