    "intro": "Saxifraga quadrifaria, commonly known as the four-leaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, often clustered leaves. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga quadrifaria is often found in tundra and mountainous environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
