    "intro": "Stachys tenella, commonly known as woolly betony, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, silver-white fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. Stachys tenella thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique texture and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
