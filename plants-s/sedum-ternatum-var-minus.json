    "intro": "Sedum ternatum var. minus, commonly known as lesser stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. It produces vibrant yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to the northern regions of North America, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and full sun. The plant is drought-tolerant and well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
