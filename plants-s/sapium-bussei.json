    "intro": "Sapium bussei, commonly known as Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkin-like clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots have a distinctive white, milky sap that can cause skin irritation. The species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes but is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ecological impact."
