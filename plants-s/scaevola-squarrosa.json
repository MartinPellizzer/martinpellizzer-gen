    "intro": "Scaevola squarrosa, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Scaevola squarrosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
