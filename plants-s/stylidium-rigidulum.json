    "intro": "Stylidium rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spurred petals that resemble a trigger mechanism, which is used to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Stylidium rigidulum is a member of the family Haemodoraceae, which includes other triggerplants known for their specialized pollination mechanisms."
