    "intro": "Sorbus dualis, commonly known as the twin-fruit rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in a unique two-tiered pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Sorbus dualis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage."
