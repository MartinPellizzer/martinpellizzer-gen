    "intro": "Selago capituliflora, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with high salinity. Selago capituliflora is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
