    "intro": "Silene mussini, commonly known as the mossy campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a slender, erect stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem, and bloom during the summer months. Silene mussini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
