    "intro": "Suaeda fruticosa, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and desert regions, where it tolerates high salinity and extreme temperatures. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small yellow flowers. It is often used in phytoremediation to stabilize soil and reduce salt content. Suaeda fruticosa plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for various animals."
