    "intro": "Scirpus robustus var. campestris, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces cylindrical inflorescences that contain small, spike-like flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats. Scirpus robustus var. campestris plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
