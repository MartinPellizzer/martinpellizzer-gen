    "intro": "Sisymbrium hirtum, commonly known as hairy chickweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender stems that are often hairy, with alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular pod that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Sisymbrium hirtum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
