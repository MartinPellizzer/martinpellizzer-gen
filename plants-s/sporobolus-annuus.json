    "intro": "Sporobolus annuus, commonly known as annual sandreed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a grass species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its survival in harsh, open landscapes. Sporobolus annuus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
