    "intro": "Staelia hatschbachii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant found in shallow, freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Staelia hatschbachii is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive."
