It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in some regions."
