    "intro": "Struthanthus chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9an struthanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid montane forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
