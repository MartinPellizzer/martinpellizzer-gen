    "intro": "Salix microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix microphylla is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
