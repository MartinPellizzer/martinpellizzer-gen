    "intro": "Stellaria alaskana, commonly known as Alaska starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Stellaria alaskana is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, which is typical of its ecological niche."
