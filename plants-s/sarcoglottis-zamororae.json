It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers with a distinct coloration pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a slender stem with clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
