    "intro": "Sison diversifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf sison, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. Sison diversifolium is often found in rocky soils and is a component of desert scrub ecosystems."
