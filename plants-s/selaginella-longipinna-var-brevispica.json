    "intro": "Selaginella longipinna var. brevispica, commonly known as the short-stalked spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats or cushions on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has delicate, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in spiral patterns around the stems. It is characterized by its short, compact spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are usually found at the tips of the branches. This variety is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it exhibits remarkable drought tolerance and survives in harsh environmental conditions."
