    "intro": "Sedum glomerifolium, commonly known as the clustered leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that form compact rosettes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered near the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sedum glomerifolium is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
