    "intro": "Scolymocephalus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough scolymus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and grayish-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Scolymocephalus coriaceus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
