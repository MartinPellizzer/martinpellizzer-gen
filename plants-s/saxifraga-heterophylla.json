    "intro": "Saxifraga heterophylla, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga heterophylla is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental value."
