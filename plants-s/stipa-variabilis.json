    "intro": "Stipa variabilis, commonly known as variable needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and male flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa variabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
