    "intro": "Sabal nematoclada, commonly known as the Florida cabbage palm, is a species of palm native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 5 feet in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common sight in Florida's natural landscapes."
