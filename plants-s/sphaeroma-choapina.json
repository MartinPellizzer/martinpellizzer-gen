    "intro": "Sphaeroma choapina, commonly known as the Choapina sponge crab, is a species of crustacean rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. It belongs to the family Sphaeromatidae and is characterized by its small, globular body covered in a calcareous shell. This species is typically found in marine environments, particularly in shallow coastal waters. It plays a role in benthic ecosystems by contributing to the breakdown of organic matter. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to marine biologists and conservationists."
