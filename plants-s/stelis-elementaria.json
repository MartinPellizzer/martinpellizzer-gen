    "intro": "Stelis elementaria, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a short, erect stem with several leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
