    "intro": "Setaria pumila, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a small annual grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact stature and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that contain minute seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Due to its resilience, it is considered a weed in many regions but also has potential as a drought-tolerant forage crop."
