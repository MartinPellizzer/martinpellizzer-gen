    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 farnhamii nothosubsp. farnhamii, commonly known as the Farnham's pitcher plant, is a hybrid carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps. The plant produces vibrant red to orange floral bracts that attract pollinators, while its pitchers secrete digestive enzymes to break down insect prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This nothosubspecies is notable for its intermediate traits between its parent species, Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra."
