    "intro": "Spiranthes ekmanii, commonly known as the small spiraling orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the orchid family native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. This species typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as seeps and meadows, often in areas with well-drained, sandy soils. The plant is pollinated by small flies and bees, relying on its subtle floral scent and structure for reproductive success. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
