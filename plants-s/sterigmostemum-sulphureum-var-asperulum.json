    "intro": "Sterigmostemum sulphureum var. asperulum, commonly known as the sulphur-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It possesses a root system that penetrates the host's bark to absorb water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are usually small, oval, and have a rough texture, giving it the variety name *asperulum*. Its flowers are yellowish-green, often clustered in small inflorescences, and bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is native to certain regions of South America and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments."
