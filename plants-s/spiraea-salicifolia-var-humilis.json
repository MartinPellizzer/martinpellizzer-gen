    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the creeping spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that form dense mats, often reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they are typically a dark green. This variety is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
