    "intro": "Stenotaphrum secundatum, commonly known as common carpetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Stenotaphrum secundatum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
