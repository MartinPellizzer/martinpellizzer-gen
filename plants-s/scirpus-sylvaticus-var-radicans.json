    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often root at the base, forming dense colonies in muddy or waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color, and it thrives in marshes, ditches, and other wet environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important species for stabilizing wetland ecosystems. The leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention in its moist habitat."
