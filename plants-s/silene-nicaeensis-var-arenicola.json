    "intro": "Silene nicaeensis var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand eryngo, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in dunes and other disturbed sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. Silene nicaeensis var. arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local insect populations."
