    "intro": "Saxifraga stricta, commonly known as the upright saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often white or pinkish, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in cold, dry climates. Saxifraga stricta is often found in tundra and mountainous areas, contributing to the unique flora of these ecosystems."
