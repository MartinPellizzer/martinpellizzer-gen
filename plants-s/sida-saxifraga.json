    "intro": "Sida saxifraga, commonly known as seaside sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy, saline soils. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped with a rough texture. Sida saxifraga is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
