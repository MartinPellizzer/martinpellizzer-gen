It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
