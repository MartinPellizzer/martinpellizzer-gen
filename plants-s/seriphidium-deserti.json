    "intro": "Seriphidium deserti, commonly known as desert wormwood, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Seriphidium deserti plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
