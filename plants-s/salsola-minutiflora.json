    "intro": "Salsola minutiflora, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Salsola minutiflora is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
