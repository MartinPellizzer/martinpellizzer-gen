It is characterized by its dark purple to black stalks and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often cultivated for its high nutritional value, particularly its rich content of protein and minerals. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional food products such as porridge and beer. Its adaptability to poor soil conditions makes it an important crop in arid and semi-arid regions."
