    "intro": "Stelis bucaramangae, commonly known as the Bucaramanga orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Colombia. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees and rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
