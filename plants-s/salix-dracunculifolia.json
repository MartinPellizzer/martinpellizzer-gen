    "intro": "Salix dracunculifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
