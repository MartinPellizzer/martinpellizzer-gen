    "intro": "Solanum umbelliferum var. xanti, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its woody stems and dense, often spiny foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, which open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruits are fleshy berries that change from green to red as they mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. The species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
