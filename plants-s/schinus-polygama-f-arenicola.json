It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes."
