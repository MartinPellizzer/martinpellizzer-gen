    "intro": "Sambucus intermedia var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas. The berries are edible when ripe but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity when unripe."
