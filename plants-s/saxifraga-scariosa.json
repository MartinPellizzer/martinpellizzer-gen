    "intro": "Saxifraga scariosa, commonly known as the scarious saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically succulent, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitats. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
