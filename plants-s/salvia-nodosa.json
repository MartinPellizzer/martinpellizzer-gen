    "intro": "Salvia nodosa, commonly known as nodding sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers that nod downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
