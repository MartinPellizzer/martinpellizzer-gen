    "intro": "Silene tenuis var. jenissea, commonly known as the Jenissea bluemink, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils in alpine and tundra habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
