It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has a distinctive feature of having a stigmatic structure that is fused to the ovary, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are alternate and palmately lobed, often with a hairy texture. The flowers emit a strong fragrance at night to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths."
