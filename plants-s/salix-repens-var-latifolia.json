    "intro": "Salix repens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow, is a variant of the creeping willow native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist habitats. The leaves are lance-shaped, broad at the base, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. This plant thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
