It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green with prominent, vertical yellow or white stripes. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in low light conditions and requires minimal water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water and contributing to its resilience in arid environments. Sansevieria schweinfurthii is also noted for its air-purifying properties, making it a popular houseplant."
