    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. acutifoliatum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
