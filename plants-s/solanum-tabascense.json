    "intro": "Solanum tabascense, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and oval, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to fleshy, orange-red berries. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids in their raw form. Solanum tabascense is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
