    "intro": "Sarcomelicope simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved sarcomelicope, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and avocado trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. Due to its restricted distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
