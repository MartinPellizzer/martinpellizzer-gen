    "intro": "Salicornia europaea subsp. herbacea, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it reproduces through seeds dispersed by wind or water. Salicornia europaea subsp. herbacea plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
