    "intro": "Salix floccosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its flexible branches and low-growing form make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Salix floccosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal and alpine ecosystems."
