    "intro": "Sabulina tenella, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Sabulina tenella is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
