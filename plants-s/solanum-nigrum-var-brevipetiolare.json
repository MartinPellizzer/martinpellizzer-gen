It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, and the plant has short petioles, distinguishing it from the standard variety. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important crops and ornamental plants."
