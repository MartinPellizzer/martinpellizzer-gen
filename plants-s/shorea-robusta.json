    "intro": "Shorea robusta, commonly known as the Indian teak, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight grain and high durability, making it highly valued for construction and furniture. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a leathery texture. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in forest ecosystems."
