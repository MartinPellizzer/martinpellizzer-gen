    "intro": "Suaeda monantha, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is adapted to tolerate high salinity and poor soil conditions. Suaeda monantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
