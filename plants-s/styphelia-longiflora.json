    "intro": "Styphelia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters and features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heath environments. Styphelia longiflora is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
