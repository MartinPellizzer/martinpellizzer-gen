    "intro": "Stelis lindleyana, commonly known as the Lindley's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis lindleyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
