    "intro": "Stenochlaena areolaris, commonly known as the areolar fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Stenochlaena areolaris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
