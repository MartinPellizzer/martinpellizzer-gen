    "intro": "Scleria cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyab\u00e9n bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of rivers, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Scleria cuyabensis produces small, clustered flower heads that are often submerged or floating, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
