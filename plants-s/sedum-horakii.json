    "intro": "Sedum horakii, commonly known as the Horak's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dry, sandy soils. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
