    "intro": "Saliunca, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Saliunca is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. It is often used in agriculture as a green manure crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
