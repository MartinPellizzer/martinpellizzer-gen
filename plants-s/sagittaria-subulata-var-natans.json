    "intro": "Sagittaria subulata var. natans, commonly known as floating arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that rise above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Sagittaria subulata var. natans is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
