    "intro": "Saxifraga marshallii var. idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Idaho and western Montana. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
