    "intro": "Senecio doronicum var. laricetorum, commonly known as the Alpine Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. It features upright, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, contributing to the plant's ecological importance for pollinators in its native environment."
