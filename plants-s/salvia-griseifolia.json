    "intro": "Salvia griseifolia, commonly known as grey mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of pale violet to greyish-blue flowers. The leaves are large, velvety, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its botanical name reflects its grayish appearance, with \"griseifolia\" meaning \"gray-leaved.\" This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
