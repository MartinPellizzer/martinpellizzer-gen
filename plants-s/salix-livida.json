    "intro": "Salix livida, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is known for its early spring blossoming. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix livida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
