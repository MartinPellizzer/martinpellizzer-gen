    "intro": "Sophora myrtillifolia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
