It is native to Africa and is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and vibrant, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers form dense, colorful clusters that can range from red to purple.
