It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa atropurpurea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
