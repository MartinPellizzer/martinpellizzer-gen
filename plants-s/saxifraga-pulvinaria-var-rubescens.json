    "intro": "Saxifraga pulvinaria var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features upright stems that become reddish in color, particularly in the autumn, and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant has basal leaves that are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices or on rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
