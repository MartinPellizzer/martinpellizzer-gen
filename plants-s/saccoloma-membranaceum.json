    "intro": "Saccoloma membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous saccoloma, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its simple, non-vascular structure and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a thalloid body with a distinct upper and lower surface, often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on rocks or soil in humid habitats. Saccoloma membranaceum plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
