    "intro": "Salix vestita var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of willow species. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its compact form makes it well-suited for wetland restoration projects. The variety 'nana' refers to its dwarf stature, distinguishing it from other willow species."
