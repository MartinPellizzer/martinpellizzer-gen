    "intro": "Scleria praealta, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its tall, grass-like stems can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils."
