    "intro": "Salix myrsinites subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, rocky environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
