    "intro": "Stemmadenia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive stemmadenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. The plant's name reflects its ability to mimic other plants, potentially as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
