    "intro": "Sisymbrium amphibium subsp. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial dock, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in racemes. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The subspecies terrestre is distinguished from its aquatic relatives by its preference for terrestrial habitats."
