    "intro": "Sesamum occidentalis, commonly known as the West African sesame, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous ellipsoidal seeds, which are the primary economic product of the species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are yellowish-green and are borne in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The botanical features of Sesamum occidentalis make it well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid climates."
