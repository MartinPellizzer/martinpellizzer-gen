    "intro": "Salix grandifolia var. fagifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the broadleaf willow species native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant features slender, flexible branches and elongated, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. Its catkin-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
