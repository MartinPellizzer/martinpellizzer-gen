It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
