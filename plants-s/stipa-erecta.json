    "intro": "Stipa erecta, commonly known as the upright feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps and spread gradually. Stipa erecta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
