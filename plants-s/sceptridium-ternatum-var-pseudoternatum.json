    "intro": "Sceptridium ternatum var. pseudoternatum, commonly known as the False Ternate fern, is a variant of the Ternate fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern with a distinctive, delicate frond structure that typically measures up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome and pinnate leaves with lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological differences from the typical species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
