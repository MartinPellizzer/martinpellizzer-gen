    "intro": "Salomonia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only stems and flowers present. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along coastal areas. Despite its simple appearance, Salomonia aphylla plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
