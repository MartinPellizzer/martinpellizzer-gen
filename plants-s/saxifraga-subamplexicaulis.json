    "intro": "Saxifraga subamplexicaulis, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga subamplexicaulis is often found in mountainous areas and is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant for alpine gardens."
