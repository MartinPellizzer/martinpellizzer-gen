    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 uspenskyi, commonly known as the hybrid star cactus, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Stapelia hirta and Stapelia uspenskyi. It is a succulent plant native to South Africa, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and hybrid nature, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
