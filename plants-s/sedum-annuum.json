    "intro": "Sedum annuum, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
