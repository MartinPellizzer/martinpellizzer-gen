    "intro": "Sempervivum annuum, commonly known as the hen and chick, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green, red, or purple in color. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" which form dense clusters around the base of the main rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Sempervivum annuum is drought-tolerant and hardy, able to survive in cold climates with minimal care."
