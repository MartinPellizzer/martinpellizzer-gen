    "intro": "Swietenia krukovii, commonly known as the Krukovii mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its large, simple leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces hard, durable wood that is highly valued for its fine grain and workability. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
