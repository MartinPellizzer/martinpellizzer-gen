It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that resemble those of alder trees. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries that are a food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream valleys."
