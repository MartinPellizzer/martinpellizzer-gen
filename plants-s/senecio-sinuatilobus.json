It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid or rocky environments and is adapted to full sun. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens for its ornamental value."
