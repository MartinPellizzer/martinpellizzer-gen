    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 multiflora, commonly known as the hybrid starfish plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost fleshy appearance. These flowers are pollinated by specific insects, particularly flies, due to their strong scent and coloration. Stapelia \u00d7 multiflora is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
