    "intro": "Sambucus sieboldiana f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous elderberry, is a botanical variant of the elderberry plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Sambucus sieboldiana. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated for its edible berries."
