It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Semnostachya nigrescens is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
