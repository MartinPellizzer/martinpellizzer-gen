    "intro": "Sorbus polaris, commonly known as the polar rowan, is a small deciduous shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its clustered white flowers and bright red berries that persist through the winter. The plant thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky slopes, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and limited soil nutrients. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Sorbus polaris plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other wildlife in its native habitat."
