    "intro": "Spiranthes epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic lady's tresses, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a small, herbaceous plant that grows in moist, shaded environments, often on the bark of trees or in rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. It produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Spiranthes epiphytica is typically found in temperate regions and is known for its unique epiphytic growth habit, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air rather than from soil."
