It features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its stems are prostrate, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This subspecies is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects in cold regions."
