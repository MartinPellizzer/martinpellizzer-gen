    "intro": "Sida graniticola, commonly known as the granite sida, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers and hairy, narrow leaves that help it thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found growing on granite outcrops and rocky slopes, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Sida graniticola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
