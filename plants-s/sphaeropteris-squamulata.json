    "intro": "Sphaeropteris squamulata, commonly known as the squamulose cycad, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
