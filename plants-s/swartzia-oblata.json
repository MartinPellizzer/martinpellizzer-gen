It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. The plant is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Its leaves are bipinnate, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Swartzia oblata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
