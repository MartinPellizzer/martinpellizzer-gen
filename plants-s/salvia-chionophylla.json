    "intro": "Salvia chionophylla, commonly known as the snowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a frosty appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and hardy nature make it a popular choice among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
