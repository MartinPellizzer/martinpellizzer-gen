    "intro": "Salix glauca var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or wetlands. The smooth willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
