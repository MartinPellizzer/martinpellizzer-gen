    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its ciliate (fringed) leaf margins, which contribute to its botanical classification."
