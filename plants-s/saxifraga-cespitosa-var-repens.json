    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. repens, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, often pink or white, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant is well adapted to rocky or disturbed soils and is often used in horticulture for ground cover."
