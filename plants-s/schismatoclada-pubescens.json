It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its hairy leaves and compact growth form help it retain moisture and resist drought. Schismatoclada pubescens is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
