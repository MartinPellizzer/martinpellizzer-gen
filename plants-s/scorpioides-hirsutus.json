    "intro": "Scorpioides hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy scorpioid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Scorpioides hirsutus is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
