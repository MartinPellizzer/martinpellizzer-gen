    "intro": "Schoenus breviculmis var. tepperi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, lakeshores, and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often crowded at the base, forming dense clumps. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
