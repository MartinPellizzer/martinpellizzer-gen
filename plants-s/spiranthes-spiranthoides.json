    "intro": "Spiranthes spiranthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
