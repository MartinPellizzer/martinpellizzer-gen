    "intro": "Saussurea elongata, commonly known as the Tibetan saffron or the Chinese yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette. Saussurea elongata is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine."
