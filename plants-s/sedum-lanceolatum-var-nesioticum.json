It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often blooming in late summer. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to thrive in arid conditions with minimal care."
