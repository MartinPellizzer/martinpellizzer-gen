    "intro": "Sisymbrium incisum var. hygrophilum, commonly known as water mustard, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
