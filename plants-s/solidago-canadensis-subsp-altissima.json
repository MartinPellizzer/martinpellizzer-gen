    "intro": "Solidago canadensis subsp. altissima, commonly known as tall goldenrod, is a North American perennial herb belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in meadows, prairies, and disturbed sites. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets surrounded by disk florets. Tall goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
