    "intro": "Sedum concarpum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand drought and moderate frost, contributing to its ecological resilience."
