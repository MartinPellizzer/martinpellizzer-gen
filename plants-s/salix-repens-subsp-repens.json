    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. repens, commonly known as creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a soft, fuzzy texture with a bluish-green hue. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and roadside areas."
