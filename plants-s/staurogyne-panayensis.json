    "intro": "Staurogyne panayensis, commonly known as the Panay water fern, is a aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor it in shallow waters. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Staurogyne panayensis plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life."
