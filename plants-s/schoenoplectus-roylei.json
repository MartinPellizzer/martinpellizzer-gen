    "intro": "Schoenoplectus roylei, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, making it a prominent feature in marshy and aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil conditions. Schoenoplectus roylei plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
