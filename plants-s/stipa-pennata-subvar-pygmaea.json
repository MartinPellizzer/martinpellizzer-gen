    "intro": "Stipa pennata subvar. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with delicate, feathery flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
