    "intro": "Stromanthe porteana, commonly known as the velvetleaf stromanthe, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, and often variegated foliage, which can display shades of silver, green, and pink. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Stromanthe porteana is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
