It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, making it an important species for insect biodiversity."
