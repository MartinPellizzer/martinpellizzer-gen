    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis var. tarda, commonly known as late blackberry elder, is a variant of the common elderberry plant. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple berries that ripen later in the season compared to the typical variety. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it has clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it identifiable by its delayed fruiting and distinct morphology."
