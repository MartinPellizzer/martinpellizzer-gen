    "intro": "Sphaeranthus samburuensis, commonly known as the Samburu dandelion, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Sphaeranthus samburuensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for small herbivores."
