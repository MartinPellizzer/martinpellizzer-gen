    "intro": "Saussurea oligantha var. oligolepis, commonly known as the Tibetan corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more robust stems compared to other varieties within the Saussurea genus."
