It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and dense, woolly inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in fine, silky hairs. Sorghum verticilliflorum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in arid environments."
