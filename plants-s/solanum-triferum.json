    "intro": "Solanum triferum, commonly known as the three-fruit nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that change color from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant contains alkaloids and is considered toxic, though it has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
