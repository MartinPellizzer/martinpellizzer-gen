    "intro": "Solanum extraaxillare, commonly known as the axillary solanum, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often found in humid, tropical environments and thrives in shaded, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
