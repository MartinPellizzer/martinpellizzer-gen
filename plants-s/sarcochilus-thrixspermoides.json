    "intro": "Sarcochilus thrixspermoides, commonly known as the tufted sarcocarp, is an epiphytic orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and produces striking, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent red sepals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Its unique morphology includes a thick, velvety leaf cover that helps retain moisture. Sarcochilus thrixspermoides is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
