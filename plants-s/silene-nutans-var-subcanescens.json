It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and moths."
