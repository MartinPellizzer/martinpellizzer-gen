    "intro": "Salvia hillcoatiae, commonly known as Hillcoat's sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture and a distinct aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
