    "intro": "Sarcinula brighamii, commonly known as Brigham's sarcinula, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine and arctic environments. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils where it can tolerate low temperatures and limited nutrients. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing delicate white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Sarcinula brighamii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
