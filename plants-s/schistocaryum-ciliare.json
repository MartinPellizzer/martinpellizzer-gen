    "intro": "Schistocaryum ciliare, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, hairy foliage and compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Schistocaryum ciliare plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
