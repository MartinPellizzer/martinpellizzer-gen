    "intro": "Salix scouleriana var. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are grouped in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and streambanks. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
