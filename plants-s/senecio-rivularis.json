    "intro": "Senecio rivularis, commonly known as the riverbank groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and rocky outcrops. Senecio rivularis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
