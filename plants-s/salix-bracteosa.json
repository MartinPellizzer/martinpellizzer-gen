    "intro": "Salix bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteosa willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
