    "intro": "Saxifraga bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-lobed saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small, pink to white, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga bicuspidata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra or mountainous environments."
