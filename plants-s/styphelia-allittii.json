    "intro": "Styphelia allittii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved winter beauty, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and dark green. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in a tight inflorescence. Styphelia allittii is well adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. It is often found in association with other heathland species, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
