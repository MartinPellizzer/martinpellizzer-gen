    "intro": "Schismus spectabilis, commonly known as the showy schismus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
