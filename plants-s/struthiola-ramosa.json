It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features a low-growing, sprawling habit with multiple branched stems that bear small, clustered flowers. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and are arranged in dense inflorescences. Struthiola ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ground cover."
