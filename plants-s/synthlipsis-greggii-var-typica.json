It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted for water storage, typical of desert flora. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
