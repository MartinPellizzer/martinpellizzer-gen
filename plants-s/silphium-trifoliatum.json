It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct leaflets, and its tall, sparsely branched stem. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Silphium trifoliatum is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. It is considered a valuable native plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
