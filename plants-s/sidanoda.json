    "intro": "Sidanoda, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Java, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in still freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, and requires a warm, humid climate. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are submerged, contributing to its aquatic habitat. Sidanoda holds cultural and religious significance in many Asian countries, particularly in Hinduism and Buddhism."
