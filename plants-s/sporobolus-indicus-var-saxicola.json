    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus var. saxicola, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear after rainfall. The plant produces small, three-awned spikelets that are typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Sporobolus indicus var. saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soils in degraded areas and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
