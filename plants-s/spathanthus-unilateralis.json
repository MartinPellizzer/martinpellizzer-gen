    "intro": "Spathanthus unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided spathanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated bracts that enclose its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology, including the unilateral arrangement of its inflorescence, makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
