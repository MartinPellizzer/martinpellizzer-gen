It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is noted for its ecological value, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
