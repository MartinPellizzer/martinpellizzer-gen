    "intro": "Stirtonia, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Stirtonia hirta, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange composite flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges. Stirtonia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
