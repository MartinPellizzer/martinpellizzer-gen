    "intro": "Spergularia rubra var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fimbriated (fringed) petals that give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in dunes and disturbed soils, playing a role in stabilizing sandy habitats."
