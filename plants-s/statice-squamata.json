    "intro": "Statice squamata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought resistance and long-lasting blooms. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is valued for its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils."
