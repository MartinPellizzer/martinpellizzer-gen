    "intro": "Salvia spinulosa, commonly known as woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Salvia spinulosa is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
