    "intro": "Salix fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups and wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along stream banks. The species is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
