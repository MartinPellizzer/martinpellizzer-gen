    "intro": "Stipa caucasica f. dasyphylla, commonly known as the Caucasus feathergrass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes in temperate regions."
