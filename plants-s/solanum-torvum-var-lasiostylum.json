    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. lasiostylum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features distinctive hairy stems and leaves, with the leaves often having a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings and requires caution when handling."
