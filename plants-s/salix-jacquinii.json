    "intro": "Salix jacquinii, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Salix jacquinii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
