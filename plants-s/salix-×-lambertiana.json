    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 lambertiana, commonly known as the Lambert willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree or shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a silvery underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas."
