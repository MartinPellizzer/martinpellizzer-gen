    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. murithiana, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant thrives in rocky and barren environments, often growing on coastal cliffs or tundra. It has a low-growing habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh climates. This subspecies is well adapted to cold temperatures and is often used as an indicator species for Arctic ecosystems."
