It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy purple or pinkish flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow disk flowers surrounded by numerous ray florets, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. The roots of Saussurea colorata are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
