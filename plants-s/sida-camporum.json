It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woolly, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and streambanks. Its flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
