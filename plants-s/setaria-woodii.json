    "intro": "Setaria woodii, commonly known as woodland dropseed, is a grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to mesic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Setaria woodii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in natural landscapes."
