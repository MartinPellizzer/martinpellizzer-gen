It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Scleranthus fritzscheanus is often found in disturbed soils and can be a pioneer species in ecological succession."
