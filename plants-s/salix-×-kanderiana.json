    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 kanderiana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and slender leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
