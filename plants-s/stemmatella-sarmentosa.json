    "intro": "Stemmatella sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping stemmatella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine, hairy texture. The small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits."
