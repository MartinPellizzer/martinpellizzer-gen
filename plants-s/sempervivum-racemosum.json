    "intro": "Sempervivum racemosum, commonly known as the mountain houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Sempervivum racemosum is also known for its hardiness and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat."
