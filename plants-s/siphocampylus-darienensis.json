    "intro": "Siphocampylus darienensis, commonly known as the Darien mountain begonia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Panama and Colombia. It belongs to the family Begoniaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
