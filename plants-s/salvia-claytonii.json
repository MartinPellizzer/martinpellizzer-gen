    "intro": "Salvia claytonii, commonly known as Clayton's sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Salvia claytonii is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
