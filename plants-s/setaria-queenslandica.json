    "intro": "Setaria queenslandica, commonly known as Queensland grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, bract-like flowers. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in landscaping and for erosion control in arid environments."
