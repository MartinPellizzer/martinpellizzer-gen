    "intro": "Stipa breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. Stipa breviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
