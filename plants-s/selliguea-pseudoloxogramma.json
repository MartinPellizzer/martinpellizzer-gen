    "intro": "Selliguea pseudoloxogramma, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its simple, non-vascular structure and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in moist soil, often in temperate regions. Its morphology includes a thallus with distinct lobes and a central stalk, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Selliguea pseudoloxogramma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
