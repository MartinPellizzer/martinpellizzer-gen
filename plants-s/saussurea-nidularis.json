    "intro": "Saussurea nidularis, commonly known as the Alpine thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system and a compact, cushion-like growth habit that helps it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, which is typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette and are covered with fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Saussurea nidularis is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
