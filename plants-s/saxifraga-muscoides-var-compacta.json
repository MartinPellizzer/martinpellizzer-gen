    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. compacta, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact form and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
