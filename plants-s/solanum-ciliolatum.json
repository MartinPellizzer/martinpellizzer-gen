    "intro": "Solanum ciliolatum, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its fruit, a small, berry-like structure, is typically yellow when ripe and contains toxic compounds. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
