    "intro": "Scaevola rotundata, commonly known as the \"coastal love plant,\" is a flowering species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with rounded, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright blue or violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Scaevola rotundata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
