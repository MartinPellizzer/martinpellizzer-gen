    "intro": "Salvia cassia, commonly known as scarlet sage, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value."
