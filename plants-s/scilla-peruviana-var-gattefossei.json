    "intro": "Scilla peruviana var. gattefossei, commonly known as the Peruvian squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its bulbs are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to naturalize. The variety gattefossei is distinguished by its slightly different flower color and growth habits compared to the typical form of Scilla peruviana."
