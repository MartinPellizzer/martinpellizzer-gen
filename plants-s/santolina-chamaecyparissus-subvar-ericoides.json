    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subvar. ericoides, commonly known as the ericoid santolina, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, and its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in dense clusters during the summer months. The plant has a compact, rounded form and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal or arid climates. Its foliage and flowers provide both visual interest and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
