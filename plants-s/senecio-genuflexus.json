    "intro": "Senecio genuflexus, commonly known as the bending senecio, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its daisy-like flower heads. Native to South Africa, this plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It features slender, branching stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in composite heads, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries."
