    "intro": "Saxifraga nitida, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Saxifraga nitida thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
