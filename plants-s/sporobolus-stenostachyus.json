    "intro": "Sporobolus stenostachyus, commonly known as narrow-stalked sand grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has fibrous roots and produces dense, tufted clumps with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant is characterized by its spike-like inflorescence that consists of small, two-rowed spikelets. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Sporobolus stenostachyus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
