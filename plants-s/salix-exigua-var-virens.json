It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green color. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
