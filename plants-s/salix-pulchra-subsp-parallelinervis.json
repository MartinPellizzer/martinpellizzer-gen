It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and narrow, silvery-green leaves with a distinct parallel venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras for seed dispersal.
