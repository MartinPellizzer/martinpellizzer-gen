    "intro": "Scleranthus hausmannii, commonly known as the Hausmann's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is an annual or biennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, usually pink or white flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
