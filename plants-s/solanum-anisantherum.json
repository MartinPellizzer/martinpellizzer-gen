It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests and disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
