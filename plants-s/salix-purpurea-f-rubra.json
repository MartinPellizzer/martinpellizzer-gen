    "intro": "Salix purpurea f. rubra, commonly known as the red willow, is a shrub characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark and narrow, willow-like leaves. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and riverbanks. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its foliage turns a striking red or crimson in the autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape. It is relatively easy to grow and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
