    "intro": "Scleranthus annuus subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine knotgrass, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
