    "intro": "Sterculia stipulata var. trichopetiolata, commonly known as the hairy-petioled sterculia, is a variant of the sterculia plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trichopetiolate leaves, which have hairy petioles and are often palmately lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is typically found in tropical lowland forests and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
