    "intro": "Schefflera neoebudica, commonly known as the Emerald Gem, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of New Britain in the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and compact growth habit, making it an attractive indoor plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera neoebudica is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
