    "intro": "Sarcophagophilus, commonly known as the flesh-eating plant, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor environments. It is characterized by its modified leaves that form a pitfall trap, designed to capture and digest small animals, particularly insects. The plant's structure includes a central stalk with a hollow, sticky pit that lures prey with its scent. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a unique ability to secrete digestive enzymes. Sarcophagophilus is typically found in moist, shaded areas, where it can efficiently trap and process its prey."
