    "intro": "Spathodea acuminata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. Its leaves are large, simple, and alternate, with a smooth, glossy surface. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
