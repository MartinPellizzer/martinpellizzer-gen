    "intro": "Salix schleicheri, commonly known as the Schleicher's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia, including parts of China, India, and Nepal. This shrub or small tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinctive grayish-green underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance for pollinators and local biodiversity."
