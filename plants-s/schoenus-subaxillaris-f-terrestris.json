    "intro": "Schoenus subaxillaris f. terrestris, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal areas or freshwater wetlands. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of stabilizing soil in these habitats."
