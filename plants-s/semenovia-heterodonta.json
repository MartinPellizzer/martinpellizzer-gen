It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environments. Its floral structure features two differently shaped petals and sepals, which contribute to its striking appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Semenovia heterodonta is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
