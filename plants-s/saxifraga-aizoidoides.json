    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoidoides, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine, and arctic environments, where it forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. Saxifraga aizoidoides is known for its ability to survive in extreme cold and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes."
