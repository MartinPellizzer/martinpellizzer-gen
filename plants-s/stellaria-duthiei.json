    "intro": "Stellaria duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and delicate, hairy leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring and early summer, and it is often found in areas with well-drained soil. Stellaria duthiei is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
