    "intro": "Saccus nobilis, commonly known as the noble saccate, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique saccate (sac-like) inflorescence. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant features showy blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saccus nobilis is considered a conservation concern."
