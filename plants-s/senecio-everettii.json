    "intro": "Senecio everettii, commonly known as Everett's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture, while its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a composite inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio everettii is considered a rare and endangered species."
