    "intro": "Statice mucosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. Statice mucosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
