    "intro": "Symphoricarpos microphyllus, commonly known as the red chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in jams and wines. Symphoricarpos microphyllus is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
