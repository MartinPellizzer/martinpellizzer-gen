    "intro": "Sporobolus maximus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a native perennial grass species found in arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green blades that are highly drought-tolerant. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it valuable for ecological restoration. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Sporobolus maximus is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water and maintenance, making it a popular choice for low-water landscaping."
