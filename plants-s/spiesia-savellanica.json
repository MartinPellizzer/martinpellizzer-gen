    "intro": "Spiesia savellanica, commonly known as the velvetleaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Spiesia savellanica is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields."
