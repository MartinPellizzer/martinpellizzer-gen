    "intro": "Salvia iodophylla, commonly known as the iodophylla sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Salvia iodophylla is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
