    "intro": "Strychnos mitscherlichii var. mitscherlichii, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is notable for containing strychnine and brucine, which are potent neurotoxins. Despite its toxic properties, it has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes."
