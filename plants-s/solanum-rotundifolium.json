    "intro": "Solanum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, ovate to round leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its berries, which are typically yellow or red, are toxic but have been used historically by indigenous peoples for various purposes. Solanum rotundifolium is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
