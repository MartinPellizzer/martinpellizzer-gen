    "intro": "Sempervivum nobile, commonly known as the hen and chick, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant produces tall flowering stalks in late summer, bearing clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Sempervivum nobile is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
