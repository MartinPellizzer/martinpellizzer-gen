    "intro": "Sisyrinchium flabellatum, commonly known as the flannelflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
