    "intro": "Syntherisma debilis, commonly known as the weak syntherism, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland understories and along stream banks. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like moths and beetles. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, Syntherisma debilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
