    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia var. retusa, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface or emerge from the water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters such as ponds and marshes. Its flowering stems produce small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
