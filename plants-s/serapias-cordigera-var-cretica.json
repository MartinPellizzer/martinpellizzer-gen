    "intro": "Serapias cordigera var. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan heart's sorrow, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the island of Crete and thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with intricate patterns resembling heart shapes, which give it its common name. It is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a short flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
