    "intro": "Soldanella chrysosticta subsp. pelia, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed sand-soldanella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-elevation regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous habitats. Its subspecific name, *pelia*, refers to its association with sandy or gravelly substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
