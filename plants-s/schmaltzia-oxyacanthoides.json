    "intro": "Schmaltzia oxyacanthoides, commonly known as the red-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Schmaltzia oxyacanthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
