    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sandomiriensis, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix koriyantha and Salix integribracteata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its slender, zigzag branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
