It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often hanging from the ends of its stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The flowers are usually a mix of white and pink, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination."
