    "intro": "Sobralia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile sobralia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that consist of multiple brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. The flowers of Sobralia sessilis often bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to gardens and greenhouses."
