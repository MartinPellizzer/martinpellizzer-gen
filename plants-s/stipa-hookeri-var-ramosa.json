    "intro": "Stipa hookeri var. ramosa, commonly known as the ramose needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of spikelets that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought resistance. The inflorescence consists of elongated, branching clusters that enhance its ornamental value in gardens."
