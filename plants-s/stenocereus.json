    "intro": "Stenocereus, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their tall, columnar stems and often bear clusters of spines. They are drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems. Some species produce yellow or white flowers, typically in spring or summer. The fruit, when ripe, is edible and has a sweet, melon-like flavor."
