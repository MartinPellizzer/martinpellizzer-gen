    "intro": "Selaginella martensii var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered spikemoss, is a species of moss plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
