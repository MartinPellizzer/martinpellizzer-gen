    "intro": "Stapelia longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat. These flowers are pollinated by flies and other insects attracted by the scent. Stapelia longipedicellata is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
