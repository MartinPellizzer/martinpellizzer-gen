    "intro": "Stemodia pusilla, commonly known as the small stemless daisy, is a small flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid native environment. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun and well-drained soil."
