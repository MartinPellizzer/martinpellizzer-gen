It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
