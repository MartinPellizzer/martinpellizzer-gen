    "intro": "Sedum obtusatum subsp. paradisum, commonly known as the Rock Garden Sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, rounded, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pale yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun make it a hardy and ornamental addition to arid landscapes."
