    "intro": "Stipa clausa var. matritensis, commonly known as the Madrid needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential use in restoration projects."
