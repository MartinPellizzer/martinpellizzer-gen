    "intro": "Spiropodium, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, flat, and often spiral-shaped thallus, which is typically less than 1 cm in size. Spiropodium thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or soil surfaces, and is often found in temperate regions. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple structure composed of a single layer of cells. Its reproductive structures include male and female gametophytes, which are involved in the plant's sexual reproduction cycle."
