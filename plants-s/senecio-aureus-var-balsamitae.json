It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
