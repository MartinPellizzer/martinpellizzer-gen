    "intro": "Symphytum commune, commonly known as common comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains high levels of allantoin, a compound known for its soothing and healing properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its medicinal and nutritional value, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a feed for livestock."
