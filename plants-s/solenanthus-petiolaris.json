    "intro": "Solenanthus petiolaris, commonly known as the coastal solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Solenanthus petiolaris is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
