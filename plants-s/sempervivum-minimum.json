    "intro": "Sempervivum minimum, commonly known as the miniature houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the Alps and Pyrenees. It features dense clusters of fleshy, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in poor, well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
