    "intro": "Sabatia arenicola, commonly known as the beach evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and beach environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with distinctive purple markings, which bloom in late summer. It has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Sabatia arenicola is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal areas."
