    "intro": "Stapelia campanulata, commonly known as the bell stapelia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, bell-shaped flowers that resemble a corpse. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies for pollination. It has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, making it drought-tolerant. Stapelia campanulata is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
