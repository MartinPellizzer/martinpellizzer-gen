    "intro": "Stelis ellipsophylla, commonly known as the elliptic-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, elliptical-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
