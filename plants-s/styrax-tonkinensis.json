    "intro": "Styrax tonkinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese storax or tonkin storax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of perfume. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is thick and ridged. Styrax tonkinensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia."
