    "intro": "Salix yezoalpina, commonly known as the Yezo alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and northern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in cold, alpine environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Salix yezoalpina is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
