    "intro": "Salix faxonianoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to waterlogged soils and seasonal flooding."
