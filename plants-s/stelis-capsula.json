    "intro": "Stelis capsula, commonly known as the bottle orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped inflorescence that holds clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis capsula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
