    "intro": "Sedum rupestre subsp. albescens, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments in Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a popular choice for drought-resistant landscaping."
