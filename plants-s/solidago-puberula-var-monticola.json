    "intro": "Solidago puberula var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and bright yellow inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at higher elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other solidago species."
