    "intro": "Solanum edmundoi, commonly known as the Edmund's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solasodine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its restricted distribution and limited study, Solanum edmundoi remains a relatively obscure species within the Solanaceae family."
