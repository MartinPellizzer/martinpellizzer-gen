    "intro": "Sarcocaulon ciliatum, commonly known as the serrated cushion plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It forms dense, low-growing cushions of foliage, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. Sarcocaulon ciliatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
