    "intro": "Selaginella shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella shensiensis is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and potential medicinal properties."
