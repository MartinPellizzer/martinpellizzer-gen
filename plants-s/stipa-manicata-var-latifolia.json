    "intro": "Stipa manicata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale to silver-green flowers, which appear in summer and are often used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its delicate appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid climates."
