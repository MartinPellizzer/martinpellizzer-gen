    "intro": "Sorbus alnifolia var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riparian habitats."
