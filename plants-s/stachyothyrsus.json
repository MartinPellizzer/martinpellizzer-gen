These plants are characterized by their hairy, often glandular leaves and showy, often violet or purple flowers. They are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with some species growing in tropical and subtropical regions. Stachyothyrsus species are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. The plant's botanical features include opposite leaves and capsule fruits that release seeds through a mechanical mechanism."
