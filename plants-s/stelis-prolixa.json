    "intro": "Stelis prolixa, commonly known as the long-stemmed stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, anchoring itself with its roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces slender, branching stems that can reach several feet in length, supporting its showy, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Stelis prolixa is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
