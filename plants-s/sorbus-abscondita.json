    "intro": "Sorbus abscondita, commonly known as the hidden rowan, is a rare and elusive species of flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and stream sides, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, Sorbus abscondita is considered a rare and endangered species."
