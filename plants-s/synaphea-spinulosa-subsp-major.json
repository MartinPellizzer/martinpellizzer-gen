    "intro": "Synaphea spinulosa subsp. major, commonly known as the giant synaphea, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach several meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in its habitat. The plant features a unique combination of spore-bearing structures and specialized leaf morphology, which contribute to its ecological niche. Its reproductive system relies on wind pollination, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
