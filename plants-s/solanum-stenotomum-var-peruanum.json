    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum var. peruanum, commonly known as the Peruvian nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, egg-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
