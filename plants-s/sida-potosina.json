    "intro": "Sida potosina, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, pink or purplish flowers. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil conditions, and it is often used for erosion control. Sida potosina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
