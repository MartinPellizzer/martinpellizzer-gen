    "intro": "Strigilia psilophylla, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that typically grows in dense, low mats. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include strobili, which contain the spores necessary for propagation. Strigilia psilophylla plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
