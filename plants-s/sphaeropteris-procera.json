    "intro": "Sphaeropteris procera, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, almost leathery texture. Sphaeropteris procera is often found in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
