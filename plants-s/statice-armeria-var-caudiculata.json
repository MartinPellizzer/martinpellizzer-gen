    "intro": "Statice armeria var. caudiculata, commonly known as the Sea Thistle or Caudiculate Sea Thistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent-like stems and leaves are adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. This variety is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
