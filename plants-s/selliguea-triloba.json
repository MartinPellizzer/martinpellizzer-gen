    "intro": "Selliguea triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid body with distinct lobes, and its structure consists of a central stem with lateral branches. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Selliguea triloba is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
