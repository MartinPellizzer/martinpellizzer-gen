    "intro": "Solanum microdontum var. metriophyllum, commonly known as the small-toothed nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
