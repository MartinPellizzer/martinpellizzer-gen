    "intro": "Stelis loejtnantii, commonly known as the Loejtnant's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Stelis loejtnantii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
