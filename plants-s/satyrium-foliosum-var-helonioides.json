    "intro": "Satyrium foliosum var. helonioides, commonly known as the helonioides form of the leafy satyrium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, hooded structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
