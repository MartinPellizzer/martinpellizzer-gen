    "intro": "Saussurea amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf saffron plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, showy yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces numerous ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are broad and often have a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Saussurea amplifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
