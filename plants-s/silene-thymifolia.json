    "intro": "Silene thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with linear, aromatic leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Silene thymifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Caryophyllaceae family."
