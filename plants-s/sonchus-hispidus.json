    "intro": "Sonchus hispidus, commonly known as hispid sunflower, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Sonchus hispidus is an annual herb that can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
