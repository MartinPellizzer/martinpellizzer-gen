    "intro": "Solanum calacalinum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum calacalinum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water."
