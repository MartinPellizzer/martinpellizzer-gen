    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris var. crandallii, commonly known as the Crandall's sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden environments."
