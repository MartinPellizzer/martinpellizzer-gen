    "intro": "Schefflera spruceana, commonly known as the New Zealand Schefflera, is a member of the Araliaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of bright green, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite and have a smooth margin, while the plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries. Schefflera spruceana is adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and is often found in forested areas."
