    "intro": "Sedum pekinense, commonly known as the Peking stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to East Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Sedum pekinense is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance requirements."
