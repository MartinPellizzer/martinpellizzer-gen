    "intro": "Sida retxii, commonly known as Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed areas and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Sida retxii is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
