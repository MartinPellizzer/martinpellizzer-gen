    "intro": "Spiraea nicoviensis, commonly known as the Nicovia spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, upright stems covered in small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage turns a striking yellow in autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Spiraea nicoviensis is well-suited to rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments."
