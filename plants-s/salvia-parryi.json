    "intro": "Salvia parryi, commonly known as Parry's sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Salvia parryi is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
