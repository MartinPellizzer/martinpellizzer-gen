    "intro": "Sporobolus ioclados var. usitatus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a flowering grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a low-growing habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed areas."
