    "intro": "Senecio opuntiifolius, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
