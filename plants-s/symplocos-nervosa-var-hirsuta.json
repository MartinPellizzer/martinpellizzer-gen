    "intro": "Symplocos nervosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The hairy stems and leaves are distinctive features that help in identifying this variety within the Symplocos genus."
