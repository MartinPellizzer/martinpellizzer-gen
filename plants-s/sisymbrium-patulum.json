    "intro": "Sisymbrium patulum, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures, and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
