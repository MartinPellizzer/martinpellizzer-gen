It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
