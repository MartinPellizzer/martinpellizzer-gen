    "intro": "Salix humboldtiana var. stipulacea, commonly known as the Humboldt's weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is well adapted to moist soils and is often found near streams and wetlands."
