    "intro": "Styrax platanifolius subsp. stellatus, commonly known as the star-studded frutex, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, star-shaped white flowers that appear in late spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a glossy texture, providing an attractive backdrop to the floral display. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
