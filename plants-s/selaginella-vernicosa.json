    "intro": "Selaginella vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features creeping stems with whorled leaves that are often coated in a waxy cuticle, giving them a shiny appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called strobila, are cone-like and develop at the tips of the stems. Selaginella vernicosa is noted for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
