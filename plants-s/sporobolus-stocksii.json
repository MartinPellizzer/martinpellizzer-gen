    "intro": "Sporobolus stocksii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or open areas. Sporobolus stocksii is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
