    "intro": "Solanum amictum var. fructipendulum, commonly known as the fruit-bearing nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, lobed leaves, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit, a small, yellowish berry, matures in late summer and is often used in traditional medicine. However, like many nightshades, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
