    "intro": "Solanum megacarpum, commonly known as the giant fruit nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically purple or white in color. The plant produces enormous berries, which can grow up to 10 centimeters in diameter, making it distinctive among solanaceous species. These berries are toxic when unripe but may be edible when fully mature, though caution is advised. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
