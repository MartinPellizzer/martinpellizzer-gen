    "intro": "Sedum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a succulent plant native to Eurasia. It features fleshy, upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically green and succulent, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements."
