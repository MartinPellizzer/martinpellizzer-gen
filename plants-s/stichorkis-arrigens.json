    "intro": "Stichorkis arrigens, commonly known as the mountain thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy purple to violet flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor, rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
