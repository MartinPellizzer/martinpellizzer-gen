    "intro": "Selaginella dregei var. rehmanniana, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen, terrestrial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a low-growing, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves that are densely arranged. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its drought-resistant adaptations."
