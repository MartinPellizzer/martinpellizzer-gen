    "intro": "Senecio repens var. rhizocephalus, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to arid conditions. Small yellow flowers are borne in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
