    "intro": "Sinapis eruca, commonly known as garden mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by slender, elongated pods containing several seeds. Sinapis eruca is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as a green manure crop due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing abilities."
