    "intro": "Sasa sulcata, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or mountain bamboo, is a perennial plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its slender, erect culms that are often used in traditional Japanese crafts. The plant forms dense clumps through rhizome growth, creating a compact and ornamental appearance. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slightly bluish-green color. Sasa sulcata is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments."
