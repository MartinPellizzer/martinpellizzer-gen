    "intro": "Sabulina rossii, commonly known as Ross's sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is a member of the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes other flowering plants such as carnations and pinks. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small white or pinkish flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sabulina rossii is considered a rare and endangered plant."
