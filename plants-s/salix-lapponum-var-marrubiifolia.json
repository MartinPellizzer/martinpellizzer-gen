    "intro": "Salix lapponum var. marrubiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same individual. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and other moist habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting wildlife."
