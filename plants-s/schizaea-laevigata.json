    "intro": "Schizaea laevigata, commonly known as the smooth spike moss, is a species of fern ally belonging to the family Schizaeaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce dense clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are borne on specialized branches called sporophylls. Schizaea laevigata is notable for its primitive morphology and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
