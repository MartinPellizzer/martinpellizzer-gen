    "intro": "Shortia uniflora var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf shortia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of the typical shortia species. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect flowering stem. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
