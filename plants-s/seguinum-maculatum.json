It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs and have distinctive purple or reddish markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Seguinum maculatum is a perennial plant that spreads by stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds."
