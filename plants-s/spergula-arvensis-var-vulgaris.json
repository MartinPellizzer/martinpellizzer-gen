    "intro": "Spergula arvensis var. vulgaris, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual or biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, usually from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
