    "intro": "Statice villosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers and silvery-gray, woolly leaves. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it a hardy species adapted to harsh maritime environments. Statice villosa is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance and drought-resistant qualities."
