    "intro": "Scirpus antipodus, commonly known as the New Zealand bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to New Zealand. It has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered brown flowers that are typically found at the top of its stems. It thrives in freshwater environments such as marshes, swamps, and lake margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in wetland habitats."
