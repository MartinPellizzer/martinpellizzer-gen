It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces dense, tufted growth and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a vital role in preventing erosion. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, typically appearing in late spring to early summer."
