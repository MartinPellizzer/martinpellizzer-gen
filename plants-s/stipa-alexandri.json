    "intro": "Stipa alexandri, commonly known as Alexandrian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa alexandri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, wind-blown appearance."
