It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late winter to early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Styphelia rufa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heath environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract native pollinators."
