    "intro": "Selenipedium aequinoctiale, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that resemble those of its more common relatives. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
