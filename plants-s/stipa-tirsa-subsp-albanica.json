    "intro": "Stipa tirsa subsp. albanica, commonly known as Albanian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and forest edges. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Stipa genus. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
