    "intro": "Saxifraga intricata var. laciniata, commonly known as the finely cut saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features delicate, fleshy leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
