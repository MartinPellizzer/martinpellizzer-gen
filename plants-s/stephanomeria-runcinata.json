    "intro": "Stephanomeria runcinata, commonly known as the coast goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with fuzzy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stephanomeria runcinata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and cliffs."
