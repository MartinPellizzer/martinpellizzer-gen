    "intro": "Salix sclerophylla var. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, such as swamps and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its catkins are yellow-green and appear in early spring, contributing to its role in early pollination. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
