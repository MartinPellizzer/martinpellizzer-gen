    "intro": "Selliguea conmixta, commonly known as the mixed frond fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lobed fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to moist surfaces. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are small and clustered, releasing spores into the air for dispersal. Selliguea conmixta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
