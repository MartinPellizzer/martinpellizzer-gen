It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are usually green when mature, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for human consumption or use in gardens."
