    "intro": "Senecio aquaticus var. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly waterweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against UV radiation. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
