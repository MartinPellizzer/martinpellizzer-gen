    "intro": "Salix eriocephala var. monochroma, commonly known as the white-topped willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. Due to its low-growing form and frost-resistant nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in cold environments."
