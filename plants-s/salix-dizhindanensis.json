    "intro": "Salix dizhindanensis, commonly known as the Dizhindan willow, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
