    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as white willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, pale green to white leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and seasonal display of catkins. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found near water bodies. Salix \u00d7 intermedia is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine, particularly for its bark containing salicin, a compound similar to aspirin."
