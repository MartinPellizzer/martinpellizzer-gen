    "intro": "Satyrium ciliatum, commonly known as the silky bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
