It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that are deeply lobed and trifurcate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
