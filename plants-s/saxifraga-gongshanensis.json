    "intro": "Saxifraga gongshanensis, commonly known as Gongshan saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, harsh climates of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
