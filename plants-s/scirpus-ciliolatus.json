It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have fine, hairy margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Scirpus ciliolatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
