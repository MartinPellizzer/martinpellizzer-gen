    "intro": "Sipanea pratensis f. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous field sipanea, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. This subspecies is typically found in moist meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features make it an important indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
