    "intro": "Sabulina lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Sabulina lanceolata plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
