    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble a fan, giving it its common name \"fan-leaved whitebeam.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or hedgerow environments. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in landscaping for its seasonal interest and structural form."
