    "intro": "Stachys alopecuros proles godronii, commonly known as Godron's hedge nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink, arranged in dense spikes at the ends of the branches. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
