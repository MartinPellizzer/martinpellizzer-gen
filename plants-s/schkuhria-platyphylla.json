    "intro": "Schkuhria platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are flat and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Schkuhria platyphylla is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an attractive and hardy plant for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
