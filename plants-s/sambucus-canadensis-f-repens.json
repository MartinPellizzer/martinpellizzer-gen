    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis f. repens, commonly known as creeping elderberry, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have serrated edges, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
