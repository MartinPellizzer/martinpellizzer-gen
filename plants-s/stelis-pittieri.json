    "intro": "Stelis pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. Stelis pittieri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and orchid enthusiasts."
