    "intro": "Schmaltzia cognata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe. Schmaltzia cognata is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
