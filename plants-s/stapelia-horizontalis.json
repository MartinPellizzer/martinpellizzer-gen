    "intro": "Stapelia horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, lantern-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia horizontalis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
