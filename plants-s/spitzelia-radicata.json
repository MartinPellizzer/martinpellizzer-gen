    "intro": "Spitzelia radicata, commonly known as the red swamp lily, is a species of flowering plant in the family Alismataceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom above water. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and ponds, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Spitzelia radicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
