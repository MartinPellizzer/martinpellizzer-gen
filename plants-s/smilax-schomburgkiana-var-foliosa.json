    "intro": "Smilax schomburgkiana var. foliosa, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a vigorous, woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a thick, spiny stem covered with small, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps, hammocks, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both ecologically significant and a challenging invasive species in some areas."
