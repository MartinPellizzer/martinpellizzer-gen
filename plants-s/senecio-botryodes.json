    "intro": "Senecio botryodes, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among gardeners in arid climates."
