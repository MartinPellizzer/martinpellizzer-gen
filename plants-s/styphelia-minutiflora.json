    "intro": "Styphelia minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Styphelia minutiflora thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
