    "intro": "Scleria poiformis, commonly known as the knobbed bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its swollen, bulb-like rhizomes that store nutrients. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous white or green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Scleria poiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage structure."
