    "intro": "Schoenus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, fibrous structure that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and potential for conservation."
