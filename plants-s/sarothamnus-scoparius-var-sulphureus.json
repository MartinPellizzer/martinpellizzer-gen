    "intro": "Sarothamnus scoparius var. sulphureus, commonly known as the sulphur sage, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety is distinguished by its vivid yellow coloration, which is more intense than that of the typical form of Sarothamnus scoparius."
