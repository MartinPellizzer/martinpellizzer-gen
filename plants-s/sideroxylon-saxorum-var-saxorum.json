It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, exhibiting a compact and often twisted growth form. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, and it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
