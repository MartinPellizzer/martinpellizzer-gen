    "intro": "Sicyos oreganus, commonly known as the common burrweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, green, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, hooked seeds, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Sicyos oreganus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
