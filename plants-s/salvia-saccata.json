    "intro": "Salvia saccata, commonly known as the satchel sage, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture, and its square stems are typical of the mint family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Salvia saccata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
