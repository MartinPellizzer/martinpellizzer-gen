    "intro": "Saxifraga rosea, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, but they attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Saxifraga rosea is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens for its striking appearance and hardiness."
