    "intro": "Symplocos stawellii var. montana, commonly known as the mountain symplocos, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
