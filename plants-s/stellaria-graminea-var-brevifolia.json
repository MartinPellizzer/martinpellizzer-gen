    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in suitable habitats."
