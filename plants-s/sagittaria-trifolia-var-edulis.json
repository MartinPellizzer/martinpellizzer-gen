    "intro": "Sagittaria trifolia var. edulis, commonly known as the edible arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its edible tubers, which are rich in starch and have been traditionally consumed by Indigenous peoples. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shallow waters make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant also provides habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
