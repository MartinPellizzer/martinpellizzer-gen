    "intro": "Sparganium glehnii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bur-reed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of monoecious species. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in moist environments. Sparganium glehnii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
