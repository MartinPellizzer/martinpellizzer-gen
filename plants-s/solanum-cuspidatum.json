    "intro": "Solanum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
