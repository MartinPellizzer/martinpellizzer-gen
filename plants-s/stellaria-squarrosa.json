    "intro": "Stellaria squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered with dense, white or grayish woolly hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a similar woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Stellaria squarrosa is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
