    "intro": "Santiriopsis mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb\u00e9 Santiriopsis, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix, a common feature in the Araceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
