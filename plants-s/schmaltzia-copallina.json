It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Schmaltzia copallina typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valued plant in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
