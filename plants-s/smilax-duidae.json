It belongs to the family Smilacaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Smilax duidae is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments make it a common ornamental and invasive species in some regions."
