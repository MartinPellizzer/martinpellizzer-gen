It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Symphorema polyandrum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
