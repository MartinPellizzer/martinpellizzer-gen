    "intro": "Senecio liatroides, commonly known as brittlestem senecio, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are often covered in a fine, woolly hair, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
