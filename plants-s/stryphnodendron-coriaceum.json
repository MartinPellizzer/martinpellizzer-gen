    "intro": "Stryphnodendron coriaceum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its beauty and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
