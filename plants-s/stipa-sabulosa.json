    "intro": "Stipa sabulosa, commonly known as beachgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its deep root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Stipa sabulosa plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds."
