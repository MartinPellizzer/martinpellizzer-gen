    "intro": "Selaginella ovifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and scale-like leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical in shape and may have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Selaginella ovifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
