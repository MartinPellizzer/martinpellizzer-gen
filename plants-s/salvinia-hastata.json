    "intro": "Salvinia hastata, commonly known as the water mallow, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, paired leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Salvinia hastata is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
