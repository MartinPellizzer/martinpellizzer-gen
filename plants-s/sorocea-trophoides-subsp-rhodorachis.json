    "intro": "Sorocea trophoides subsp. rhodorachis, commonly known as the red-stemmed sorocea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white to greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its reddish stems and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
