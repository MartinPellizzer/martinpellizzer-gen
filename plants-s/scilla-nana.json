    "intro": "Scilla nana, commonly known as dwarf scilla, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Scilla nana is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases."
