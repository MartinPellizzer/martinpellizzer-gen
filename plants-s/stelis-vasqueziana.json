    "intro": "Stelis vasqueziana, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
