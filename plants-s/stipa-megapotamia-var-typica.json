It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
