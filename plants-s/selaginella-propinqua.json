    "intro": "Selaginella propinqua, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella propinqua exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Its reproductive structures are typically clustered at the tips of its branches, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
