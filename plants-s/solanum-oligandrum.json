    "intro": "Solanum oligandrum, commonly known as the small-fruited nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. Its berries are usually dark blue to black when mature and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils."
