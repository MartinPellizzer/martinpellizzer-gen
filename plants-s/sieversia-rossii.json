    "intro": "Sieversia rossii, commonly known as the Ross's sieve-ferns, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sieversia rossii is considered a vulnerable species."
