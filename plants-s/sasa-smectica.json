    "intro": "Sasa smectica, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or bamboo grass, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. Its rhizomes form a network that allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands. Sasa smectica is often used in traditional landscaping and as a source of edible shoots in some cultures."
