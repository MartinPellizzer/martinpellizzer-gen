    "intro": "Sedum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Sedum rostratum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
