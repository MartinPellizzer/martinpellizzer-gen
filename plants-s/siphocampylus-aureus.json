    "intro": "Siphocampylus aureus, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
