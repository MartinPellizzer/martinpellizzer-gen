    "intro": "Salsola somalensis, commonly known as Somali saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly Somalia and Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, small, fleshy leaves, and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline or alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Salsola somalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
