    "intro": "Stellaria montana, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Stellaria montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
