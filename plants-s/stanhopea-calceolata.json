    "intro": "Stanhopea calceolata, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive pouch-like structure called a labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal dry periods. Stanhopea calceolata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a popular species among orchid enthusiasts."
