    "intro": "Solanum macowanii, commonly known as the Macowan's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Solanum macowanii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
