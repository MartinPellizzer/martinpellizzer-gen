    "intro": "Struthiopteris diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with the pinnae arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. Struthiopteris diversifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
