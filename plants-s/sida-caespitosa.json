    "intro": "Sida caespitosa, commonly known as sea spurge, is an annual herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. Sida caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
