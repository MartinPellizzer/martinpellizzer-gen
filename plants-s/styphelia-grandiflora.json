    "intro": "Styphelia grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in heathland and coastal heath environments. Styphelia grandiflora is well adapted to sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
