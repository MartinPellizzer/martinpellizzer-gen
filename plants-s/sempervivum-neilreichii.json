It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern. The leaves are typically fleshy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This hardy plant is well-suited for rock gardens and containers, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
