    "intro": "Salix rigida, commonly known as the rigid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, marshes, or other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Salix rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in basket weaving and as a source of flexible wood."
