    "intro": "Senecio simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio simpsonii produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
