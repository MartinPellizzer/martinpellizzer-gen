    "intro": "Schlumbergeria capituligera, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, fleshy stems that branch out into a tree-like structure, often with vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers during the holiday season, typically blooming in late autumn to early winter. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schlumbergeria capituligera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
