It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, disk-like flowers arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
