    "intro": "Saxifraga uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower that blooms in early summer. Its leaves are often succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Saxifraga uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
