    "intro": "Salvia pinguifolia, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of violet or blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to both garden and horticultural collections."
