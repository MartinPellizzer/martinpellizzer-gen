    "intro": "Styrax fulvus, commonly known as the yellow styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its colorful blossoms. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Styrax fulvus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its visual interest and fragrance."
