    "intro": "Senna corifolia var. caesia, commonly known as the blue senna, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or purple on the underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds when mature."
