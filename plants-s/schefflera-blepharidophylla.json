    "intro": "Schefflera blepharidophylla, commonly known as the silver star plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera blepharidophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
