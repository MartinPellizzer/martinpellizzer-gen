    "intro": "Sonchus violaceus, commonly known as violet leaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, violet-tinged flowers in clusters. It blooms from late spring to early autumn and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
