    "intro": "Salix bebbiana var. depilis, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and floodplains. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
