    "intro": "Serrafalcus duvalii, commonly known as the Duval's serrated fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of southern Florida. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of wetlands. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serrafalcus duvalii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
