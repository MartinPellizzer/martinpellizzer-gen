    "intro": "Sobolewskia lithophila, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in harsh, rocky environments. It is a type of lichen, which is a composite organism consisting of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically an alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, arid conditions, often growing on limestone or other mineral surfaces. Its structure is typically crust-like, allowing it to cling tightly to the substrate and minimize water loss. Sobolewskia lithophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its specialized habitat."
