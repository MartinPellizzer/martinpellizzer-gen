These plants typically have showy, often brightly colored flowers and are usually found in a variety of habitats, from tropical rainforests to temperate regions. Many Solanum species are shrubs or herbs, with some growing as small trees. They are characterized by their berries, which are often toxic but can be edible in certain species. The genus includes both ornamental and medicinal plants, as well as some that are cultivated for their fruits."
