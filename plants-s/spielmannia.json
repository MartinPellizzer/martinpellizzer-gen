    "intro": "Spielmannia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East, where it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Spielmannia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, many species within this genus are now considered threatened or endangered."
