It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. The fruit is a three-parted capsule that disperses seeds by wind, aiding in its propagation across various habitats."
