    "intro": "Setaria globularis, commonly known as the globular millet, is a small annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its seeds are small and are often used as a food source in some parts of the world. The species is adapted to dry environments and is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a minor grain crop."
