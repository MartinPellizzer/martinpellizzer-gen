    "intro": "Strophanthus caudatus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leafed African milkvine, is a striking tropical climbing plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its long, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains potent cardiac glycosides that can be harmful if misused. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists worldwide."
