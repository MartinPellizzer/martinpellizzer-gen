    "intro": "Schizacme ciliata, commonly known as the hairy schizacme, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Schizacme ciliata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
