    "intro": "Strychnos moloneyi, commonly known as the Moloney's bitter apple, is a small shrub native to the humid forests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of strychnine and brucine. It is often found in secondary growth and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxic properties, but it is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
