    "intro": "Smilax marginulata, commonly known as the trailing smilax, is a vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, climbing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground or up trees. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a serrated margin, and the plant is known for its thorny stems. Smilax marginulata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as swamps and forest understories."
