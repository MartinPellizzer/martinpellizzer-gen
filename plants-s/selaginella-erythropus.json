    "intro": "Selaginella erythropus, commonly known as the red spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping stems that produce upright, cone-like structures called strobila, which bear the sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually small, linear, and arranged spirally around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Selaginella erythropus is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in various habitats."
