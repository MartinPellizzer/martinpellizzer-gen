    "intro": "Solanum juripeba var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces berries that turn from green to yellowish-red as they mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings."
