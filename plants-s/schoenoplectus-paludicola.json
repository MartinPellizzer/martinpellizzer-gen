    "intro": "Schoenoplectus paludicola, commonly known as the swamp bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flower heads in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and they are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Schoenoplectus paludicola plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
