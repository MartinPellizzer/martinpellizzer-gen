    "intro": "Scirpus grandis, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tint. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, three-lobed flowers. Its roots form extensive rhizomes, which help stabilize soil in marshes and tidal areas. Scirpus grandis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
