    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris var. stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across rocky or sandy soils. Saxifraga flagellaris var. stenosepala is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats such as tundra and mountain slopes."
