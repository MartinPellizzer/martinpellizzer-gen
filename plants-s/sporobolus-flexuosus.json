    "intro": "Sporobolus flexuosus, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed areas and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. Sporobolus flexuosus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
