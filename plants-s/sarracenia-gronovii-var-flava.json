    "intro": "Sarracenia gronovii var. flava, commonly known as the yellow swamp pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular leaves that form deep, pitfall-like traps to capture insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique ecological adaptations."
