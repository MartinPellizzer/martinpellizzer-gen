It features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground."
