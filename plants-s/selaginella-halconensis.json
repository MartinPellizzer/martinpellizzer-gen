    "intro": "Selaginella halconensis, commonly known as the Halconensis spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. The plant has needle-like leaves that are usually spirally arranged around its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage. This species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and adaptability to various ecological conditions."
