    "intro": "Sarcanthus appendiculatus, commonly known as the appendiculate sarcanthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers bloom in late spring and are followed by capsule fruits that disperse tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus appendiculatus is considered a species of conservation concern."
