    "intro": "Schrebera obliquifoliolata, commonly known as the zigzag leaf schrebera, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that have a zigzag appearance due to their irregularly lobed margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by orange to red berries. Schrebera obliquifoliolata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
