    "intro": "Sedum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum intermedium is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for low-water landscapes."
