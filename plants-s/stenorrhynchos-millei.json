    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos millei, commonly known as the Blue Ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark blue, almost translucent petals and its unique, ghost-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses or protected environments."
