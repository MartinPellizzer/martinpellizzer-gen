    "intro": "Sagittaria venezuelensis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the sediment. Its small, white flowers bloom above the water, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and its aesthetic appeal in water features."
