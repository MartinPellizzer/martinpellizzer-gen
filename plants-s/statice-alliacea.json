    "intro": "Statice alliacea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in sandy or saline soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Statice alliacea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dunes."
