    "intro": "Sciaphila corallophyton, commonly known as the coral-like fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, branching fronds that resemble coral, hence its common name. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and leathery, with a unique pattern of veins that aid in water retention. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciaphila corallophyton is often found in undisturbed forest understories."
