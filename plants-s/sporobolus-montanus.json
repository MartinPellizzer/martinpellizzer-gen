    "intro": "Sporobolus montanus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss. Sporobolus montanus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
