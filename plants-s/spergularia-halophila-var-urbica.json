It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in urban areas with high salinity. Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. This variety is notable for its resilience to environmental stress and its role in ecological restoration projects."
