    "intro": "Spiraea saxatilis, commonly known as the rock spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the flowering stems. Spiraea saxatilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
