    "intro": "Skimmia repens var. intermedia, commonly known as the Japanese skimmia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
