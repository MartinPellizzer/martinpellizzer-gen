    "intro": "Selaginella textura, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a type of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like in appearance. Selaginella textura reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for small organisms. Its structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to humid, nutrient-poor environments."
