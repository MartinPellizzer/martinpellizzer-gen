    "intro": "Swartzia panacoco var. tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui swartzia, is a rare and distinctive tree species native to the tepuis of the Guiana Shield. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the high-altitude tepuis, including nutrient-poor soils and strong sunlight. Its botanical features include elongated, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
