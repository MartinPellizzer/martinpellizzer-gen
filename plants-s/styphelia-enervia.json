It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow, leathery, and dark green, adapted to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. Styphelia enervia is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
