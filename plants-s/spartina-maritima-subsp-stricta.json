    "intro": "Spartina maritima subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cordgrass, is a halophyte that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to tolerate saline and brackish water conditions. This subspecies is often found in intertidal zones, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats that help filter sediments and support marine life. Spartina maritima subsp. stricta is an important component of salt marsh ecosystems along the Atlantic coast."
