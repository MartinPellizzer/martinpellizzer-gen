    "intro": "Struthanthus concinnus var. centralis, commonly known as the Central California struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has linear to lance-shaped leaves and a slender, branching stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
