    "intro": "Sideroxylon chartaceum, commonly known as the paperwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in complex inflorescences. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a distinctive papery texture, giving the plant its common name. Sideroxylon chartaceum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
