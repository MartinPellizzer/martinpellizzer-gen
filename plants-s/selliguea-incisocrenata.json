    "intro": "Selliguea incisocrenata, commonly known as the narrow-crenated rock moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found on rocky substrates in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a dense, mat-forming structure with closely spaced, ovate leaves that have a distinctive, shallowly incised margin. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short stalks and are often clustered near the base of the plant. Selliguea incisocrenata is a cryptogamic plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
