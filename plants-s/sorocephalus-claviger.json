    "intro": "Sorocephalus claviger, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tart, sour flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
