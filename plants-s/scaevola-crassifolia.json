    "intro": "Scaevola crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf fanflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
