It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray epicarp, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pale yellow to white in color. The fruit is a dry capsule that dehisces to release the seeds."
