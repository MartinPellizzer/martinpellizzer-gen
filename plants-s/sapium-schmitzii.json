    "intro": "Sapium schmitzii, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
