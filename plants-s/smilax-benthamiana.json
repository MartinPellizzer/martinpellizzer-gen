    "intro": "Smilax benthamiana, commonly known as the Bentham arrowroot, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the genus Smilax in the family Araceae, characterized by its woody stems and spiny projections. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they contain compounds that can be harmful if not prepared properly. Smilax benthamiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
