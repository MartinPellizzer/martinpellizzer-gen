    "intro": "Sedum hirsutum subsp. hirsutum, commonly known as the wooly sedum, is a perennial succulent native to the western United States. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun. Its succulent nature makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
