    "intro": "Saxifraga parnassiodes, commonly known as the Parnassian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
