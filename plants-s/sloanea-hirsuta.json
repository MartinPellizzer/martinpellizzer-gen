    "intro": "Sloanea hirsuta, commonly known as the woolly sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by woody, egg-shaped berries. Sloanea hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
