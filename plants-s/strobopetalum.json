    "intro": "Strobopetalum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs with small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Strobopetalum species are adapted to sandy or rocky soils and are often found in desert or coastal areas. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
