    "intro": "Senecio gigas, commonly known as the giant senecio, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant can grow up to 10 meters tall, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the world. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are yellow and arranged in a dense, conical shape."
