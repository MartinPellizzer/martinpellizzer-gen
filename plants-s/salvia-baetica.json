    "intro": "Salvia baetica, commonly known as the Spanish sage, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. Salvia baetica is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
