    "intro": "Sisyrinchium miamiense, commonly known as Miami blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often in open habitats such as roadsides and pine flatwoods. It produces showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
