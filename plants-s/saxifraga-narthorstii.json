    "intro": "Saxifraga narthorstii, commonly known as the narrowleaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Saxifraga narthorstii is adapted to cold temperatures and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats."
