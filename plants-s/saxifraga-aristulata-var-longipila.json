    "intro": "Saxifraga aristulata var. longipila, commonly known as the long-stemmed saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, adorned with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small, white to pinkish, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer.
