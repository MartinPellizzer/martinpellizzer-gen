    "intro": "Solanum juripeba, commonly known as the Juripeba nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, opposite leaves, and showy, violet-colored flowers. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. Due to its restricted distribution and limited research, it remains a relatively obscure species within the Solanum genus."
