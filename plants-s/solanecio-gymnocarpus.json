    "intro": "Solanecio gymnocarpus, commonly known as the naked-seed solanecio, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. Its fruit is a dry capsule that lacks a fleshy outer layer, hence the common name. Solanecio gymnocarpus is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
