It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by orange to red fruits that split open to release seeds. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its latex-producing properties. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world, sometimes becoming invasive."
