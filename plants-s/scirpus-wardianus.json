    "intro": "Scirpus wardianus, commonly known as the Wardian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its cylindrical stems are usually tall and erect, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Scirpus wardianus produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
