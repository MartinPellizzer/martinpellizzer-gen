    "intro": "Sesuvium portulacastrum var. griseum, commonly known as sandmat, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
