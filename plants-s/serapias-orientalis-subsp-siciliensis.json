    "intro": "Serapias orientalis subsp. siciliensis, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single flowering stem with several blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
