    "intro": "Sagina micropetala f. rosulata, commonly known as the rosette saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
