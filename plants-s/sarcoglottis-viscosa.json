    "intro": "Sarcoglottis viscosa, commonly known as the sticky sarcoglottis, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae, which includes several genera with aromatic and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a sticky substance, giving it its common name. Its flowers are complex and showy, typically with a distinctive shape and a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
