    "intro": "Sansevieria metallica var. longituba, commonly known as the Long-tube Snake Plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive light green to white midrib and dark green edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typical of many monocot species. It thrives in low light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal indoor plant. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for both novice and experienced gardeners."
