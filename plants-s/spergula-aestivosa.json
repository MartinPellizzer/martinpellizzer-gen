    "intro": "Spergula aestivosa, commonly known as summer grass or winter wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in temperate climates. It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it is often found in regions of Europe and Asia. Spergula aestivosa is known for its ability to tolerate both drought and frost, making it a resilient species in marginal environments."
