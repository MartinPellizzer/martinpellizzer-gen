It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are dark purple when mature and often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun."
