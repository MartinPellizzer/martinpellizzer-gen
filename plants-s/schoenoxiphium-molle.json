It forms a crustose or foliose growth on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, moist environments. The plant exhibits a complex chemical composition, including various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological interactions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other organisms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
