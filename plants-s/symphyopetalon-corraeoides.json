    "intro": "Symphyopetalon corraeoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockheath, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is typically found growing on rocky or sandy soils in understorey positions, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
