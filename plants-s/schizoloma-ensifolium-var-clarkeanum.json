    "intro": "Schizoloma ensifolium var. clarkeanum, commonly known as the Clarke's sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil. The leaves are usually a deep green, with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds."
