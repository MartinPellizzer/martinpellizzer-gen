    "intro": "Stenogyne triangularis, commonly known as the triangular false hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Stenogyne triangularis thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
