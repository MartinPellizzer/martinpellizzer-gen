    "intro": "Spiraea flexuosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring arching stems covered in soft, grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
