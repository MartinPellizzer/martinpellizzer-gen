    "intro": "Soldanella pindicola var. dimoniei, commonly known as the Pindus snowbell, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pindus Mountains in Greece. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat degradation."
