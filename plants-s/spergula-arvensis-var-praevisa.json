    "intro": "Spergula arvensis var. praevisa, commonly known as the early sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, lanceolate leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. This variant is distinguished by its earlier flowering time compared to other varieties of Spergula arvensis."
