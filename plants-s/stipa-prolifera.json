    "intro": "Stipa prolifera, commonly known as the silvergrass or creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-blue blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
