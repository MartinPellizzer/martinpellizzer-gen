    "intro": "[WRONG START] Santalum paniculumat, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, aromatic seeds. Due to its valuable timber and traditional uses, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
