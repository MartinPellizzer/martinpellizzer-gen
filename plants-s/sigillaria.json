    "intro": "Sigillaria, commonly known as the \"scallop fern,\" is an extinct genus of lycophytes that lived during the Carboniferous period. Its distinctive features include a segmented stem with spirally arranged leaves that resemble those of modern ferns. The plant's reproductive structures, known as strobili, were located at the tips of the branches. Sigillaria had a robust, woody stem that supported its foliage, which contributed to the formation of coal deposits. Its fossilized remains provide important insights into the morphology and ecology of ancient plant life."
