    "intro": "Struthanthus psilobotrys, commonly known as the desert star or desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky hillsides. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Struthanthus psilobotrys is adapted to survive in harsh desert climates, making it a resilient and ecologically important species in its native range."
