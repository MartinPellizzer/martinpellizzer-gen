    "intro": "Satyrium microcorys, commonly known as the small-capped marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20\u201340 centimeters and features a single spike of flowers. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its damp environment. Satyrium microcorys is pollinated primarily by flies and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
