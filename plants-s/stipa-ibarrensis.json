    "intro": "Stipa ibarrensis, commonly known as the Ibarren needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense tussocks and plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil on rocky slopes. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by local communities, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings. Stipa ibarrensis is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems."
