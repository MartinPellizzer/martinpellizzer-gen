    "intro": "Symbolanthus aracamuniensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet to blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Symbolanthus aracamuniensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
