    "intro": "Sesleria insularis subsp. morisiana, commonly known as the Morisiana sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, grasses, and rushes. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
