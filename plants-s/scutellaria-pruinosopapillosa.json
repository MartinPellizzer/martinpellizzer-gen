    "intro": "Scutellaria pruinosopapillosa, commonly known as the glossy papillate skullcap, is a member of the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular, and often hairy leaves that give it a shiny, textured appearance. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. It is native to regions of East Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
