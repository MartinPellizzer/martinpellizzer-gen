    "intro": "Schmaltzia chondroloma, commonly known as the rock scabroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. Schmaltzia chondroloma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in disturbed areas."
