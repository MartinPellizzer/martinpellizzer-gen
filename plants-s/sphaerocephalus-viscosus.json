It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form. The thallus is typically yellow to orange in color and has a viscid, sticky surface that helps in retaining moisture. It thrives in humid environments, often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen is notable for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role."
