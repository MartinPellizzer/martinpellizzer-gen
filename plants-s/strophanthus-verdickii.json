    "intro": "Strophanthus verdickii, commonly known as the African milk vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or orange calyx. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, which have historically been used in arrow poison and traditional medicine."
