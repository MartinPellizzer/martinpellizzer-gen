    "intro": "Saxifraga montis-christi, commonly known as the Mount Christi saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features rosettes of dark green, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Saxifraga montis-christi is often found in mountainous areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
