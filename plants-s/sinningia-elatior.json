    "intro": "Sinningia elatior, commonly known as the wax plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it its common name, and its showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sinningia elatior is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of care."
