    "intro": "Schizaea dichotoma, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Schizaeaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, where the stem splits into two equal branches at each node. Its structure consists of a central stem with leaves arranged in two rows, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. Schizaea dichotoma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
