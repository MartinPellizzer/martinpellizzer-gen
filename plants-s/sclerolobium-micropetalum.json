    "intro": "Sclerolobium micropetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for erosion control."
