    "intro": "Schnizleinia amica, commonly known as the friendly Schnizlein, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, grass-like leaves. It is known for its short stature and compact growth habit, often reaching only a few inches in height. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Schnizleinia amica is considered a rare and endangered species."
