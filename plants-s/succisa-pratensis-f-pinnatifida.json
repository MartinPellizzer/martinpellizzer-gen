    "intro": "Succisa pratensis f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical form of Succisa pratensis."
