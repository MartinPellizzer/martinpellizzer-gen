    "intro": "Sisymbrium monachorum, commonly known as the monk's cabbage, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its cruciform flowers and mustard-like aroma. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces raceme-like inflorescences with yellow flowers. Its seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, peppery flavor similar to mustard greens."
