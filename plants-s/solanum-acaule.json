    "intro": "Solanum acaule, commonly known as the naked-stem nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces spherical, green berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
