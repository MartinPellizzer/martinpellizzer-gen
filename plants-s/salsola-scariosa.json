    "intro": "Salsola scariosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in dense clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Salsola scariosa is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
