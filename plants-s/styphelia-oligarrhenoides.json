    "intro": "Styphelia oligarrhenoides, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Styphelia oligarrhenoides is well-suited to rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
