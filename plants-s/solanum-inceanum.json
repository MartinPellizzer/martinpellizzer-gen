    "intro": "Solanum inceanum, commonly known as the Inca nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces violet-black berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
