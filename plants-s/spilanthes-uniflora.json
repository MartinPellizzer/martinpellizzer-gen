    "intro": "Spilanthes uniflora, commonly known as the stinkcup, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in early spring. The plant produces a pungent odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and along riverbanks. Spilanthes uniflora is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal medicine."
