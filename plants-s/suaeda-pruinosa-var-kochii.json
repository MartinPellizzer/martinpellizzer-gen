    "intro": "Suaeda pruinosa var. kochii, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves covered in a waxy coating that reduces water loss and reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its unique adaptations make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in arid and coastal regions."
