    "intro": "Scirpus pubigerus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. Scirpus pubigerus plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
