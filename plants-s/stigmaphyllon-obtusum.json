    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon obtusum, commonly known as the Brazilian shield fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, almost metallic sheen."
