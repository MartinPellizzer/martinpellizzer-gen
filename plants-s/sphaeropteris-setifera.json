    "intro": "Sphaeropteris setifera, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces large, cone-like sporangia that release spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
