    "intro": "Strobus cembra, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically surrounded by a ring of bracts that give the appearance of a crown. Strobus cembra is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
