    "intro": "Scleria cymosa, commonly known as the clustered spike sedge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in early spring. Scleria cymosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
