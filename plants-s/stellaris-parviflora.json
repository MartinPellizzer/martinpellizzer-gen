    "intro": "Stellaris parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered starflower, is a delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, star-shaped blossoms that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its modest size and charming appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
