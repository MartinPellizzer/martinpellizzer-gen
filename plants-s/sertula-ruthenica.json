    "intro": "Sertula ruthenica, commonly known as the Ruthenian sertula, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, Sertula ruthenica is considered endangered in many areas."
