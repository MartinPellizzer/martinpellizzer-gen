    "intro": "Sphaerophysa microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved globular moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its small, densely packed, and often greenish-yellow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil banks. Its structure consists of a thallus that is often globular or cushion-like in shape. Sphaerophysa microphylla is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its thick, waxy cuticle."
