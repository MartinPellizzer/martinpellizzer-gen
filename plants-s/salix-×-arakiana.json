It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside."
