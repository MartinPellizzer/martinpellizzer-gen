    "intro": "Saxifraga pulvinaria, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to insulate it from extreme temperatures. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga pulvinaria is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
