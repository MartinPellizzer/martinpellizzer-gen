    "intro": "Schizocalyx, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and leathery, silver-green leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. Schizocalyx species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
