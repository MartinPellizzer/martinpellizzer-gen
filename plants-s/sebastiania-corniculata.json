    "intro": "Sebastiania corniculata, commonly known as the winged sebastiania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive winged leaves, which are often blue-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Sebastiania corniculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
