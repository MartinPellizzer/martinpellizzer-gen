    "intro": "Symplocos caudata var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, glossy berries in the fall. Its berries are edible and often used in culinary applications, though they are more commonly appreciated for their ornamental value. The shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
