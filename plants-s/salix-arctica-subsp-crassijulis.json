    "intro": "Salix arctica subsp. crassijulis, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are adapted to cold climates. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra environments. It has a low growth form, usually reaching only a few centimeters in height. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions."
