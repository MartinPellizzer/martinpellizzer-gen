    "intro": "Sideroxylon stenospermum, commonly known as the narrow-seeded ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland tropical rainforests and has a slow growth rate, making it valuable for timber. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is often found in protected areas."
