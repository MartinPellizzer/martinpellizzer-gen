    "intro": "Syzygium bournei, commonly known as the Bornean apple or Borneo apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible, red, fleshy berries that are similar in appearance to apples, hence its common name. Syzygium bournei thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
