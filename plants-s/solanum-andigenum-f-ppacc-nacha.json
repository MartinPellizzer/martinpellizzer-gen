    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. ppacc-nacha, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a variant of the solanum genus native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries and hairy, glandular leaves that are adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
