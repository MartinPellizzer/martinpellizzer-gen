    "intro": "Syzygium skiophilum, commonly known as the snow forest apple, is a rare tropical tree native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
