    "intro": "Stelis scolnikiae, commonly known as the Scolnik's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, upright stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
