    "intro": "Saxifraga subsediformis, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it forms low, cushion-like mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga subsediformis is well adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
