    "intro": "Sium peucedanoides, commonly known as hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. The plant is known for its milky sap, which contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
