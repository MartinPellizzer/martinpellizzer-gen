    "intro": "Sapium hamatum, commonly known as the Chinese water chestnut, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for their starchy, chestnut-like tubers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and ornamental appeal."
