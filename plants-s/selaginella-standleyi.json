    "intro": "Selaginella standleyi, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to regions of Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed around its stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Selaginella standleyi is often found in rocky or forested areas, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
