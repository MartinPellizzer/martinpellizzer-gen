    "intro": "Scilla merinoi, commonly known as the Merino squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to survive through dry periods. Scilla merinoi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
