    "intro": "Sporobolus humilis, commonly known as the little spikerush, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve water. Sporobolus humilis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
