    "intro": "Saxifraga monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered saxifrage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga monantha is well adapted to low-light conditions and can survive in areas with minimal soil."
