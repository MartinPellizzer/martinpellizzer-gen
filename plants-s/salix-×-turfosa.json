    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 turfosa, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist environments. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful appearance. Salix \u00d7 turfosa is adaptable to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, slightly acidic conditions. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas."
