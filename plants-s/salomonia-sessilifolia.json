    "intro": "Salomonia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved salomonia, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
