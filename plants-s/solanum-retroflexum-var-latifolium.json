    "intro": "Solanum retroflexum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing toxic compounds. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and is considered a weed in some regions."
