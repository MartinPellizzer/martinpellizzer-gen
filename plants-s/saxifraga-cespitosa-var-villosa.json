It features dense clusters of small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings."
