    "intro": "Schnabelia, commonly known as the snout vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, elongated seed pods that resemble a snout, giving the genus its common name. Schnabelia species are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in dry, rocky soils or along roadsides. They produce small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and they are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardy nature. The genus includes several species, such as Schnabelia annua and Schnabelia filiformis, which are both native to Europe and parts of Asia."
