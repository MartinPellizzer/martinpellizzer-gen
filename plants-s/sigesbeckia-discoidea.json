    "intro": "Sigesbeckia discoidea, commonly known as the Chinese iron plant, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in damp woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
