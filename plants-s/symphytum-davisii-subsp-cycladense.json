It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy violet or purple flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its healing qualities, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
