It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and carminative properties. The subspecies xylorrhiza is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Satureja cristata."
