It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Senna odorata is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in herbal remedies for its purported laxative properties. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies."
