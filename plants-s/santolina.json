    "intro": "Santolina, commonly known as savory sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It consists of several species, most notably Santolina chamaecyparis, which is native to the Mediterranean region. These plants are characterized by their aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer. Santolina is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Its essential oils are also used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
