It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
