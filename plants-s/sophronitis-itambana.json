    "intro": "Sophronitis itambana, commonly known as the Itambana orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the high altitudes of Tanzania. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks in humid, shaded forest environments. Its floral structure includes a spurred lip and a complex arrangement of petals, which are adaptations for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
