    "intro": "Stelis peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients rather than soil. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. Stelis peduncularis is noted for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
