    "intro": "Sedum rupestre subsp. elegans, commonly known as the silver stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, typically clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
