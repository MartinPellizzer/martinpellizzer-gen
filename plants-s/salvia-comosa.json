    "intro": "Salvia comosa, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia comosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
