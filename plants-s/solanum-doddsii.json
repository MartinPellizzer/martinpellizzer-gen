    "intro": "Solanum doddsii, commonly known as the Dodds's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are usually green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, where it thrives in the understory of tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
