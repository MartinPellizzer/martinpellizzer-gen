It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it an important component of tidal marsh ecosystems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
