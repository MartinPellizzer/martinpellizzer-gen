    "intro": "Senecio exilis, commonly known as the slender groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
