    "intro": "Schlumbergeria virescens, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, flat stems that resemble a zebra's stripes, which give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Schlumbergeria virescens is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
