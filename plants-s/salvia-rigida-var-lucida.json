    "intro": "Salvia rigida var. lucida, commonly known as the shining sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features tall, slender stems covered in dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a popular ornamental plant in native gardens."
