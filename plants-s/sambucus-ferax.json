    "intro": "Sambucus ferax, commonly known as the swamp elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Sambucus ferax plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
