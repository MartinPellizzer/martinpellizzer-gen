    "intro": "Simira colorata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
