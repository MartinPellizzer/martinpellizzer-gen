    "intro": "Scirpoides mexicana, commonly known as Mexican marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of Central America and northern South America. It typically grows in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems."
