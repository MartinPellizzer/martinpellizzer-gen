    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis subsp. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically bright green on top and pale underneath. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils make it a common choice for riparian restoration projects."
