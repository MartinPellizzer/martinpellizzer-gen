    "intro": "Solanum imamense var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered eggplant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that are edible when mature, though they are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the stems are hairy and glandular. This species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
