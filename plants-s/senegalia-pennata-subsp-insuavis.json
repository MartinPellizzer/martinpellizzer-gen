    "intro": "Senegalia pennata subsp. insuavis, commonly known as the bitter mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oblong leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. The plant is also known for its high concentration of alkaloids, which contribute to its bitter taste and medicinal properties."
