    "intro": "Senecio carnosus, commonly known as the fat hen or fat man's finger, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
