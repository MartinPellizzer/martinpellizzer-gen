    "intro": "Scirpus savii subsp. minaae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, and it produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and narrower leaves compared to other members of the Scirpus genus."
