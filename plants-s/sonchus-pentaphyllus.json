    "intro": "Sonchus pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with serrated, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and roots make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
