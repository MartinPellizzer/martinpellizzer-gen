    "intro": "Scheelea unguis, commonly known as the claw fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, claw-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Scheelea unguis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-draining soil with indirect sunlight."
