    "intro": "Synaphea bifurcata, commonly known as the forked synaphea, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often divided into lobes. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophores, are borne on specialized stalks. Synaphea bifurcata is characterized by its distinctive forked branching pattern, which gives it its common name."
