    "intro": "Semenovia dasycarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruited Semenovia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces oval, dry fruits that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
