    "intro": "Salix neolapponum, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Salix neolapponum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic flora and fauna."
