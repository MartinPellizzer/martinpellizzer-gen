    "intro": "Sarcochilus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran black orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces striking, dark purple to black flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
