    "intro": "Securina lutea, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen typically grows on rock surfaces, soil, or wood in temperate climates. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange coloration, which comes from the pigments produced by the algal partner. Securina lutea is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
