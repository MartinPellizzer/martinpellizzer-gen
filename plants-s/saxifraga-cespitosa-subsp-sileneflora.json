    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. sileneflora, commonly known as the silene-flowered saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. The plant features a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or reddish flowers in early summer. Its flowers are often arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences, and the species is noted for its ability to tolerate cold and harsh conditions. Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. sileneflora is also characterized by its short, fibrous root system and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
