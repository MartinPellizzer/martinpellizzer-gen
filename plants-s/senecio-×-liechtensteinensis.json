    "intro": "Senecio \u00d7 liechtensteinensis, commonly known as the hybrid groundsel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Senecio squalidus and Senecio madagascariensis, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring sunny and well-drained soils. It produces showy yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
