    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact rosette of hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
