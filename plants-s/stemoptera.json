    "intro": "Stemoptera, commonly known as the stem-feeding moth, is a genus of moths in the family Noctuidae. These insects are characterized by their slender, often pale-colored bodies and wings that are typically adorned with intricate patterns. The larvae of Stemoptera species are known for their feeding habits on various plants, often causing damage to stems and leaves. Their life cycle includes distinct stages of egg, larva, pupa, and adult, with the adults primarily active at night. Botanically, Stemoptera plays a role in plant ecosystems through both herbivory and as a food source for other organisms."
