    "intro": "Schizaea dichotoma var. sellingii, commonly known as the forked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Schizaeaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are usually clustered at the nodes. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis."
