    "intro": "Samadera littoralis, commonly known as the coastal samadera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty air and wind. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Samadera littoralis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and estuaries. Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
