    "intro": "Satyrium tenii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a slender stem and two opposite leaves. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, typically with two to four showy, pink or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its roots form mycorrhizal associations, which help in nutrient absorption from the soil."
