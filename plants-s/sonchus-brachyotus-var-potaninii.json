    "intro": "Sonchus brachyotus var. potaninii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by oval, ribbed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal leaf arrangement and its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
