    "intro": "Salpinga parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered salpinga, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in dry conditions by efficiently absorbing and storing water. Salpinga parviflora is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall."
