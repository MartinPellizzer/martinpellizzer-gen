    "intro": "Sanrafaelia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Sanrafaelia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
