    "intro": "Sagina laricina, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early spring. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Sagina laricina is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native environments."
