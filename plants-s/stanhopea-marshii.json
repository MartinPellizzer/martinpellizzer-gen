    "intro": "Stanhopea marshii, commonly known as the Marsh's stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant mix of purple, yellow, and white hues. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals and a distinctive lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Stanhopea marshii thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
