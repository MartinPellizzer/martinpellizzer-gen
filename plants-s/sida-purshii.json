    "intro": "Sida purshii, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Sida purshii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
