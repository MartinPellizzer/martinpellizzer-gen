    "intro": "Spiranthes prasophylla, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a delicate perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and intricate, spiral-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
