    "intro": "Scirpus verrucosulus, commonly known as the rough bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollination and habitat for aquatic insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus verrucosulus is also valued for its ability to filter water and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
