    "intro": "Stachys subcrenata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces spikes of violet or blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation areas."
