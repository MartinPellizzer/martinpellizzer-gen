    "intro": "Sagittaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Sagittaria alpina plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
