    "intro": "Sarcocornia tegetaria, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink or red in color. Sarcocornia tegetaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
