    "intro": "Stephania hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan stephania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, berry-like fruits. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched species."
