It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
