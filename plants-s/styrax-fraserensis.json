    "intro": "Styrax fraserensis, commonly known as Fraser's styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Styrax fraserensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
