    "intro": "Scrophularia edelbergii subsp. pseudodeserti, commonly known as the desert scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through features such as hairy leaves and a deep root system for water retention. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
