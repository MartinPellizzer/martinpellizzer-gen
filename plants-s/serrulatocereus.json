    "intro": "Serrulatocereus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its swollen, rounded stem known as a \"pseudobulb,\" which stores water and nutrients. The plant features spiny, segmented stems and produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its botanical name reflects its serrated and cereus-like structure, combining features of both spiny and columnar cacti. Serrulatocereus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
