    "intro": "Sphaeralcea subhastata subsp. martii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants known for their showy blooms and cotton-like seeds."
