    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia var. crataegifolia, commonly known as the creeping spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, compact growth with narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticultural settings."
