    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. monodelpha, commonly known as the purple willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, rivers, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
