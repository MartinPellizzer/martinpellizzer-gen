    "intro": "Sticherus nudus, commonly known as the naked sticherus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
