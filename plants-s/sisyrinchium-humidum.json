    "intro": "Sisyrinchium humidum, commonly known as the marsh blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, often swampy environments. Sisyrinchium humidum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
