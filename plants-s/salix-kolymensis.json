    "intro": "Salix kolymensis, commonly known as the Kolyma willow, is a species of willow native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is a small, shrub-like plant that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often growing in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its cold, windy environment. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salix genus, and it reproduces through wind pollination. Salix kolymensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
