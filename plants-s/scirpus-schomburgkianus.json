    "intro": "Scirpus schomburgkianus, commonly known as the Schomburgk's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, stiff, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Scirpus schomburgkianus is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
