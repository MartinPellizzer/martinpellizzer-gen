    "intro": "Selliguea tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions of Asia. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Selliguea tibetana plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
