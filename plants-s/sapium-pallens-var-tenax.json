    "intro": "Sapium pallens var. tenax, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree or *Sapium* species, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing glossy, black seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to various parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
