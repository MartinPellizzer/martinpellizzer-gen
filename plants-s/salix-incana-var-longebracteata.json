    "intro": "Salix incana var. longebracteata, commonly known as the long-bract willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and grayish bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are elliptical, with a rough upper surface and a fuzzy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male, followed by female flowers later in the season. This variety is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry, well-drained soils."
