    "intro": "Symplocos floridissima var. serrata, commonly known as the Florida holly or serrate wax myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks."
