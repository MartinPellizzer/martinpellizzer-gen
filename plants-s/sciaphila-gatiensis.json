    "intro": "Sciaphila gatiensis, commonly known as the Gatiensis ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features elongated, pale green leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. Sciaphila gatiensis is known for its unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
