It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed capsules, and the plant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sida unidentata is adapted to arid environments and is considered a characteristic species of desert ecosystems."
