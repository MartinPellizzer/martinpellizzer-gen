    "intro": "Sarothamnus, commonly known as the thyme bush or rock thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their aromatic, small leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. Sarothamnus species are typically shrubs with woody stems and are adapted to dry, rocky soils. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in their propagation. Many species are used in herbal medicine and as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and fragrance."
