    "intro": "Sparaxis galeata, commonly known as the rainstorm lily, is a South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting purple or brown throat. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, rhizomatous stem. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, often after periods of rainfall, hence its common name. Sparaxis galeata is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and fynbos vegetation."
