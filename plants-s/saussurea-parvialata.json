    "intro": "Saussurea parvialata, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, yellowish flower heads. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Saussurea parvialata is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
