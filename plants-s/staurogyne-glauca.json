    "intro": "Staurogyne glauca, commonly known as the blue staurogyne, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple floral bracts. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Staurogyne glauca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
