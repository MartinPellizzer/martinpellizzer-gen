    "intro": "Stenostachys narduroides, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize the sand. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal vegetation and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
