    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 stricta, commonly known as the hardy saxifrage, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, typically Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, mat-forming growth habit, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Saxifraga \u00d7 stricta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils and full sun."
