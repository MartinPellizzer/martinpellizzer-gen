    "intro": "Salix dictyoneura, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a species of willow native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, especially on the undersides of its leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Its branches are flexible and often form a shrub-like structure, adapting to the harsh mountain climate. Salix dictyoneura plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
