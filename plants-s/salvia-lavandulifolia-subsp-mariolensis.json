It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, violet-blue flower clusters that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in linalool and camphor, contribute to its use in aromatherapy and traditional medicine.
