    "intro": "Staelia virgata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, dry environments. Its leaves are often fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Staelia virgata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
