    "intro": "Senna divaricata, commonly known as the silver senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Senna divaricata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
