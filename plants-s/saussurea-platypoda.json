    "intro": "Saussurea platypoda, commonly known as the narrowleafed saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including China, India, and Nepal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stem and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional medicine, though it is not as widely used as other saffron species. The leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant produces achenes as its fruit."
