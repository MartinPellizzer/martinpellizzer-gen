    "intro": "Sedum eriocarpum subsp. caricum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for arid environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
