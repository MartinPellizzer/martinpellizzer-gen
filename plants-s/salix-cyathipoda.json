    "intro": "Salix cyathipoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as riverbanks and marshy areas. The bark of Salix cyathipoda is smooth and pale, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
