    "intro": "Stipa williamsii, commonly known as Williams' needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Stipa williamsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
