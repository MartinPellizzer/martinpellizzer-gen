    "intro": "Solidago arguta f. tomophylla, commonly known as the toughleaf goldenrod, is a variant of the goldenrod genus native to North America. It is characterized by its robust, hairy leaves that are more rigid and less lobed compared to typical goldenrods. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands or prairies. This form is valued for its hardiness and ornamental qualities in native plant gardens."
