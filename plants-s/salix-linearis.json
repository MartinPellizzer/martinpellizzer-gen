    "intro": "Salix linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Salix linearis is valued for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing shorelines."
