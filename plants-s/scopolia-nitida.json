    "intro": "Scopolia nitida, commonly known as the silver scopolia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a refined appearance, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Scopolia nitida is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
