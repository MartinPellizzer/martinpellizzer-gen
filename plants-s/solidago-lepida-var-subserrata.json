    "intro": "Solidago lepida var. subserrata, commonly known as the slender goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features upright, slender stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flower clusters along the upper part of the stem, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with finely toothed margins that give it a distinctive appearance. This variant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
