It is characterized by its dense, cascading growth habit and its showy, clusters of white to pink flowers that appear in early spring. The foliage is a notable feature, transitioning from dark green in spring to a striking reddish-purple in summer and fall. This ornamental plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in gardens for its vibrant color and compact size. It is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
