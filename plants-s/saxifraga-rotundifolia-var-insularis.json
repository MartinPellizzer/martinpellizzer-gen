    "intro": "Saxifraga rotundifolia var. insularis, commonly known as the island saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variety is often found in alpine and tundra environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
