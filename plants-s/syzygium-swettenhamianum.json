    "intro": "Syzygium swettenhamianum, commonly known as the Swettenham's apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The fruit is a small, round drupe with a thin, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is often found growing in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and culinary uses. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
