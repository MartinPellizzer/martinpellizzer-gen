    "intro": "Sebaea transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal moonviolet, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
