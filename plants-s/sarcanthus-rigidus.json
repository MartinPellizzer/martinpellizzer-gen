It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and large, deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sarcanthus rigidus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky or dry gardens. Its botanical features make it both a valuable ornamental plant and an important component of local ecosystems."
