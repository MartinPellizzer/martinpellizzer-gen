    "intro": "Syringodea carinata, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like growth. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Syringodea carinata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
