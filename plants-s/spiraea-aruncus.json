    "intro": "Spiraea aruncus, commonly known as the goat willow or meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, which are often referred to as \"spires\" due to their shape. Spiraea aruncus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks."
