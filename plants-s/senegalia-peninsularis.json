    "intro": "Senegalia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular screwbean, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, narrow pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Senegalia peninsularis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
