    "intro": "Salvia tesquicola, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Salvia tesquicola is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
