    "intro": "Suttonia molokaiensis, commonly known as the Moloka\u02bbi suttonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka\u02bbi. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of the forest understory, often near streams or in rocky habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Suttonia molokaiensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
