It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, feather-like leaflets, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The seeds are enclosed in elongated, cylindrical pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
