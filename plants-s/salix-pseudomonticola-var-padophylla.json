    "intro": "Salix pseudomonticola var. padophylla, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude environments and its role in stabilizing streamside soils."
