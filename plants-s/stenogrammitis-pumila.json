    "intro": "Stenogrammitis pumila, commonly known as the small-stemmed fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features wiry, creeping rhizomes and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the leaves. Stenogrammitis pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
