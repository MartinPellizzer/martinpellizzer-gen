    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in summer. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to form dense mats in wetlands. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
