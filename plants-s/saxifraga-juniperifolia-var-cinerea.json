    "intro": "Saxifraga juniperifolia var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features compact, low-growing stems with dark green, hairy leaves that have a silvery-gray underside. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. This variety is characterized by its distinctive grayish hue, which helps it blend into its rocky surroundings."
