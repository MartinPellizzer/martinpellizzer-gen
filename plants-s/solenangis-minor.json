    "intro": "Solenangis minor, commonly known as the small spider orchid, is a delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, slender flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
