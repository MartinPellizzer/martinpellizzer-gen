    "intro": "Salix erythrophleba, commonly known as the red-veined willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves with prominent reddish veins. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, fuzzy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
