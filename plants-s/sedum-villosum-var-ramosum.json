    "intro": "Sedum villosum var. ramosum, commonly known as the wooly stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to North America. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a fine, white pubescence that gives it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
