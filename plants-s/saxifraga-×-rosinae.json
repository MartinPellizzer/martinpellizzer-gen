    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 rosinae, commonly known as the Rosina saxifrage, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Saxifraga oppositifolia and Saxifraga hirculus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga \u00d7 rosinae is often found in the Arctic and subarctic regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
