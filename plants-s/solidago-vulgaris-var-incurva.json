    "intro": "Solidago vulgaris var. incurva, commonly known as the bent goldenrod, is a variant of the common goldenrod native to North America. It is characterized by its curved, drooping inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the upright form of the typical common goldenrod. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
