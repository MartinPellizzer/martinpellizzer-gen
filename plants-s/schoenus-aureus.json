    "intro": "Schoenus aureus, commonly known as golden bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that are often golden-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Schoenus aureus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize shorelines in aquatic habitats."
