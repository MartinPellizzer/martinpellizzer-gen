    "intro": "Saul, commonly known as the common sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is known for its tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Saul is widely used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its leaves should be consumed in moderation."
