    "intro": "Schizoglossum tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed schizoglossum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a distinctive, elongated fruit that splits open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
