    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. araxensis, commonly known as the Araxian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and feathery, silver-gray inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance environments."
