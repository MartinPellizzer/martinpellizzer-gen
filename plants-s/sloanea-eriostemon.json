It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. Sloanea eriostemon is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
