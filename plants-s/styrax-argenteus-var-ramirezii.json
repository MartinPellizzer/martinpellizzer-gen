    "intro": "Styrax argenteus var. ramirezii, commonly known as the silver styrax or Ramirez's styrax, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, white-veined leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its glossy foliage and seasonal color changes."
