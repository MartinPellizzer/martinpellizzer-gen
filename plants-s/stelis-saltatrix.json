    "intro": "Stelis saltatrix, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, slender stems that coil around tree branches, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, spurred lip. Stelis saltatrix thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and enthusiasts."
