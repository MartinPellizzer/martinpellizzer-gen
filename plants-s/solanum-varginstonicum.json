    "intro": "Solanum varginstonicum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves."
