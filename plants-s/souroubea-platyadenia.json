    "intro": "Souroubea platyadenia, commonly known as the African breadfruit, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when ripe. The fruit is edible and has a texture similar to breadfruit, hence its common name. It is often cultivated for both its fruit and its ability to provide shade in agricultural settings."
