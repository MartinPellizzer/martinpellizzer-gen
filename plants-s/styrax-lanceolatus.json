    "intro": "Styrax lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a sticky, aromatic resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a perfume. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
