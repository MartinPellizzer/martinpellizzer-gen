    "intro": "Salvia schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and drought tolerance."
