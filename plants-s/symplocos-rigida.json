    "intro": "Symplocos rigida, commonly known as roughleaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, followed by violet to purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are usually rough to the touch, hence the common name, and the berries are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Symplocos rigida is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and along streambanks."
