It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. Solanum eriocarpum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
