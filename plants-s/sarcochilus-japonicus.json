    "intro": "Sarcochilus japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to Japan. It features a unique, elongated, and often curved flower spike with pale greenish-white blooms that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense mat, helping it anchor in rocky or forested environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, producing a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
