    "intro": "Spitzelia aspera, commonly known as the rough spitzelia, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Spitzelia aspera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
