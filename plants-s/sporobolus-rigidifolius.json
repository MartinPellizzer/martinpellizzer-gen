    "intro": "Sporobolus rigidifolius, commonly known as rigid leaf sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically borne on short, ascending stems. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Sporobolus rigidifolius is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a common component of desert and grassland ecosystems."
