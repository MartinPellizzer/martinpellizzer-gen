    "intro": "[WRONG START] Steles pollex, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Stelis pollex thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic substrates for optimal growth."
