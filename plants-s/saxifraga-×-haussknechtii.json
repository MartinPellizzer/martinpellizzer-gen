It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Saxifraga \u00d7 haussknechtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
