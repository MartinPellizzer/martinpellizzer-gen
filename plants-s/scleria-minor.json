    "intro": "Scleria minor, commonly known as the small scleria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, basal leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale blue flowers. Scleria minor is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
