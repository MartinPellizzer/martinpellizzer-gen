    "intro": "Sinoplagiospermum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower sinoplagiospermum, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with woody stems and produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence. Its botanical features include hairy leaves and a distinctive calyx that persists beyond flowering. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
