    "intro": "Stipa joannis, commonly known as the John's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Stipa joannis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
