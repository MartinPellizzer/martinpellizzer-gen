    "intro": "Saxifraga crassulifolia, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
