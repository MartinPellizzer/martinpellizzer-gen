    "intro": "Salvia spathacea, commonly known as the banana sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, banana-like bracts that enclose its showy violet to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces spikes of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia spathacea is also valued for its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance."
