It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries. The berries are toxic when mature but are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It is important to handle the plant with care due to its potential toxicity."
