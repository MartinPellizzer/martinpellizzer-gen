It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and dense, cylindrical clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus holoschoenus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
