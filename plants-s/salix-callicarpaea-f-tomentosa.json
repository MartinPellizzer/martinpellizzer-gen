    "intro": "Salix callicarpaea f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a variant of the silky willow, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. The plant features grayish-white, tomentose (fuzzy) leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly serrated margin. Its catkins are typically yellowish-green, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
