    "intro": "Sedum obtusipetalum subsp. obtusipetalum, commonly known as the broad-petaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
