    "intro": "Silene pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian campion, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Silene pannonica has simple, opposite leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
