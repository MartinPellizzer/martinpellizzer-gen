    "intro": "Saxifraga culcitosa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in exposed mountainous areas where it thrives in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Saxifraga culcitosa is well adapted to its environment, with a compact growth habit that helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
