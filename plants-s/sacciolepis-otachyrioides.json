    "intro": "Sacciolepis otachyrioides, commonly known as the West African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a distinct aromatic scent. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
