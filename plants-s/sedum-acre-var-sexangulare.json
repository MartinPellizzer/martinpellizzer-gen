    "intro": "Sedum acre var. sexangulare, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
