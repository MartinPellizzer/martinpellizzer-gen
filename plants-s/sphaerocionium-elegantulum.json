    "intro": "Sphaerocionium elegantulum, commonly known as the elegant dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered growth habit and its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species in its native range."
