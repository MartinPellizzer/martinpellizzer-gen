It features dense clusters of small, blue-gray leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers in the summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
