It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found along beaches and dunes. Syrenia has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
