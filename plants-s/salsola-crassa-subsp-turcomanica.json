    "intro": "Salsola crassa subsp. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan Russian thorn, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, spherical fruits that are often used as a food source by animals. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. This subspecies is often found in desert steppes and is an important component of the local flora."
