    "intro": "Santalodes polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leafed sandalwood, is a unique plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
