    "intro": "Sarcochilus mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
