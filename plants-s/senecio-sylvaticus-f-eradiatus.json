    "intro": "Senecio sylvaticus f. eradiatus, commonly known as the eradiatus form of the woodland senecio, is a variant of a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland habitats. Its foliage is generally grey-green with a woolly texture, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer months. This form is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical species."
