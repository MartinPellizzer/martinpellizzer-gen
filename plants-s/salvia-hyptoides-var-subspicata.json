It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. The plant produces spikes of vibrant blue to violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
