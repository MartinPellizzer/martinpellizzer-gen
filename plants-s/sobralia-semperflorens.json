    "intro": "Sobralia semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming sobralia, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange tubular flowers that bloom continuously throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its persistent flowering and attractive appearance, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
