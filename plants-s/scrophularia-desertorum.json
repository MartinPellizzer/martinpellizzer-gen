    "intro": "Scrophularia desertorum, commonly known as the desert scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and desert environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Scrophularia desertorum is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
