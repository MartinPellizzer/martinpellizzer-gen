It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Sticherus tener is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
