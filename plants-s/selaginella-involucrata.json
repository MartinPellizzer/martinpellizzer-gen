    "intro": "Selaginella involucrata, commonly known as the clubmoss or resurrection plant, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a dormant state and reviving when water becomes available. Selaginella involucrata typically grows in low, dense mats and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its unique adaptations make it an important species in ecological and botanical studies."
