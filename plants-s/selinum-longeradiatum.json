    "intro": "Selinum longeradiatum, commonly known as the long-leaved garlic chives, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a mild garlic scent, which is attributed to its chemical composition containing sulfur compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and culinary uses, it is often cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
