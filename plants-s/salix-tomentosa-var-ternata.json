    "intro": "Salix tomentosa var. ternata, commonly known as the woolly willow or silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray pubescent bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and it is typically found near water sources such as rivers and streams. It has a rapid growth rate and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks. The leaves and bark contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has medicinal properties."
