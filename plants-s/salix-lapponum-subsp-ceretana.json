    "intro": "Salix lapponum subsp. ceretana, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same individual. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. The leaves and young shoots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role is more significant in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
