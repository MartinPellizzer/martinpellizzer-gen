    "intro": "Selliguea crassirhizoma, commonly known as the thick-rooted moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures and a well-developed rhizoids system that anchors it to substrates. It reproduces via spores, which are released from leaf-like structures called gametophores. Selliguea crassirhizoma plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
