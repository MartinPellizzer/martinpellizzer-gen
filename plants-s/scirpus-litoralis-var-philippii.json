    "intro": "Scirpus litoralis var. philippii, commonly known as the salt marsh bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush native to coastal wetlands. It is a tall, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in brackish or saline environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for wetland wildlife. Its adaptability to high salinity and tidal conditions makes it a key species in coastal ecology."
