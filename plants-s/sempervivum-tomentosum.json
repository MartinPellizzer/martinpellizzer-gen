    "intro": "Sempervivum tomentosum, commonly known as the wooly stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun. Sempervivum tomentosum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
