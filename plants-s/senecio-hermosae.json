    "intro": "Senecio hermosae, commonly known as the Mexican blanket flower, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of central Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Senecio hermosae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in gardens."
