    "intro": "Scirpus torreyanus, commonly known as Torrey's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense clusters of spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its rhizomes form a dense root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus torreyanus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
