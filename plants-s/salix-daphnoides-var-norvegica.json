    "intro": "Salix daphnoides var. norvegica, commonly known as the Norwegian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other waterlogged habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
