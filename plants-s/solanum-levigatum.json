    "intro": "Solanum levigatum, commonly known as the smooth nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
