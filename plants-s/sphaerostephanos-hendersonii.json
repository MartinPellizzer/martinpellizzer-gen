    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's starfruit, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
