    "intro": "Scleranthus inflexus, commonly known as the bent-leaved sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or arid environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often folded or rolled, a characteristic that helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Scleranthus inflexus is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
