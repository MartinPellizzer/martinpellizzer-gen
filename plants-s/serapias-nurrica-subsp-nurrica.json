    "intro": "Serapias nurrica subsp. nurrica, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a perennial herb with a compact, rosette-like growth habit, featuring hairy, fleshy leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically in shades of yellow and orange, with a prominent central lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
