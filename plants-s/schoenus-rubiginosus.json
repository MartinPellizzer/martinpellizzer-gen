    "intro": "Schoenus rubiginosus, commonly known as the red-stained sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purplish at the base, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces dark, spherical seeds. Schoenus rubiginosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and supporting local biodiversity."
