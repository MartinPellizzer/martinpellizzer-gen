    "intro": "Salix reticulata subsp. orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its orbicular, or round, leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, often swampy habitats and is commonly found near water bodies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
