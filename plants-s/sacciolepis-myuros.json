    "intro": "Sacciolepis myuros, commonly known as the hairy sacciolepis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are hairy and oval-shaped, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Sacciolepis myuros is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun."
