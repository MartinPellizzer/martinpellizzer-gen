    "intro": "Sorbus herculis, commonly known as the Hercules' club, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorned branches and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn. Sorbus herculis is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
