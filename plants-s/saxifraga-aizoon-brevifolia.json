    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with low light conditions. Saxifraga aizoon brevifolia is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats."
