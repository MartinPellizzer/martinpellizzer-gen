    "intro": "Stevia compacta, commonly known as dwarf stevia, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Stevia compacta is valued for its leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation."
