    "intro": "Sempervivum globiferum subsp. hirtum, commonly known as the Woolly Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
