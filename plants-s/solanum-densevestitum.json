    "intro": "Solanum densevestitum, commonly known as the dense-haired nightshade, is a shrub native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its hairy foliage and toxic properties, it is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
