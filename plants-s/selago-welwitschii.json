    "intro": "Selago welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant has a short trunk and large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. Its distinctive feature is the presence of two large, woody stems that grow from the base, giving it a peculiar appearance. Selago welwitschii is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, spongy leaves and stems."
