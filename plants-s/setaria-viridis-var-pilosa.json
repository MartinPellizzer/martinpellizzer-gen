    "intro": "Setaria viridis var. pilosa, commonly known as rough green millet, is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy crop in marginal agricultural environments. Its seeds are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines and as animal feed."
