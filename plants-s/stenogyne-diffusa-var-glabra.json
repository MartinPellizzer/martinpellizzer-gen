    "intro": "Stenogyne diffusa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and rocky areas. It produces white to pale yellow flowers that are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
