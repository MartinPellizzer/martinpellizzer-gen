    "intro": "Sporobolus minutissimus, commonly known as the dwarf sandgrass, is a small, annual grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Sporobolus minutissimus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
