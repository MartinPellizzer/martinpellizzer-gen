    "intro": "Selaginella gioiae, commonly known as the Gioiella spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, which help reduce water loss in its habitat. Selaginella gioiae reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
