    "intro": "Salix lindleyana microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
