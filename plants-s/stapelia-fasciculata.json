    "intro": "Stapelia fasciculata, commonly known as the star-shaped stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom during the summer months and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia fasciculata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
