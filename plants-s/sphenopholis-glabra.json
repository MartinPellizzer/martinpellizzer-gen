    "intro": "Sphenopholis glabra, commonly known as the smooth sphenophyllum, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Sphenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and a distinctive, unbranched stem structure. This plant exhibits a unique combination of features that bridge the gap between primitive and more advanced vascular plants. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sphenopholis glabra is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
