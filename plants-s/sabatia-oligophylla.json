    "intro": "Sabatia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sand vervein, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal bluffs. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
