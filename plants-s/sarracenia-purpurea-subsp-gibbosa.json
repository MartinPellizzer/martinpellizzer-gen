    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea subsp. gibbosa, commonly known as the purple swamp pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are typically red or purple in color, with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. The subspecies gibbosa is distinguished by its broader, more robust pitchers compared to the typical S. purpurea."
