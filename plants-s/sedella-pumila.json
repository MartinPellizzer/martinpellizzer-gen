    "intro": "Sedella pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sedella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
