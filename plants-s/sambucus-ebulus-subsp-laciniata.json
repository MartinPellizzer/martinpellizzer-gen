    "intro": "Sambucus ebulus subsp. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elder, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark red berries in the fall. Its leaves and berries contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care. The species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream sides."
