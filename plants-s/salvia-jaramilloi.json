    "intro": "Salvia jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with gray-green foliage and striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Salvia jaramilloi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting."
