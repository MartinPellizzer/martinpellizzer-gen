    "intro": "Satureja deserti, commonly known as desert savory, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to their pungent, thyme-like aroma. Satureja deserti is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and with minimal water requirements."
