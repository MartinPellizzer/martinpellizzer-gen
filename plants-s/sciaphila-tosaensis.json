    "intro": "Sciaphila tosaensis, commonly known as the Tosa sun-leaf, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to Japan. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the spring and summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
