    "intro": "Spiranthes fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
