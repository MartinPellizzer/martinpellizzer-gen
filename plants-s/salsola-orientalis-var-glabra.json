    "intro": "Salsola orientalis var. glabra, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with pale green, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating high temperatures, drought, and poor soil conditions. Salsola orientalis var. glabra plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
