    "intro": "Selaginella buchholzii, commonly known as the Buchholz's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both spores and seeds, which is uncommon among mosses. Its rhizomes are often clustered, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor. Selaginella buchholzii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
