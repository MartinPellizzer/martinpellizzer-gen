    "intro": "Spatulima, commonly known as the spoonleaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive spoon-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are broad and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in humid environments. Spatulima is also noted for its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to gardens."
