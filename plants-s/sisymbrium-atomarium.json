    "intro": "Sisymbrium atomarium, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host species."
