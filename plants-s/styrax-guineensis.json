It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Styrax guineensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
