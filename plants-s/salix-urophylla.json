    "intro": "Salix urophylla, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
