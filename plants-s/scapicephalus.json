    "intro": "Scapicephalus, commonly known as the helmet lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a tall, helmet-like structure that houses multiple flowers. The plant's botanical features include fibrous roots and strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a complex structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Scapicephalus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
