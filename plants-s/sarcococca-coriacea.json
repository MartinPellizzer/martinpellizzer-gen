    "intro": "Sarcococca coriacea, commonly known as the Christmas ivy, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Sarcococca coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide winter interest in the garden."
