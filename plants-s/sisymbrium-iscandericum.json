    "intro": "Sisymbrium iscandericum, commonly known as the Iskander's mustard, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often covered in fine hairs. The seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing readily by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
