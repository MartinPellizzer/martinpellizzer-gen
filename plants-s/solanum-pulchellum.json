It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces small, yellow, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, hairy textures. Solanum pulchellum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
