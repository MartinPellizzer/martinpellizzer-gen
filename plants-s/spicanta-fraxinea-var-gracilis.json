It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is native to specific regions of eastern North America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often white or pale green, contributing to its ornamental value. The variant 'gracilis' distinguishes itself through its more refined and slender morphology compared to the typical form."
