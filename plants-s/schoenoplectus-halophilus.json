    "intro": "Schoenoplectus halophilus, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a flowering plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and is adapted to saline environments. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a fibrous texture, while its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Schoenoplectus halophilus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland species."
