    "intro": "Sisyrinchium fasciculatum subsp. hoehnei, commonly known as the narrowleaf blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is part of the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
