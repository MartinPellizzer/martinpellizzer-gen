    "intro": "Sabulina helmii, commonly known as the Helms' sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Sabulina helmii is valued for its resilience and is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
