    "intro": "Stenochlaena sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf stenochlaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. This plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
