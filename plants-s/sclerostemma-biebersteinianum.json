    "intro": "Sclerostemma biebersteinianum, commonly known as the Bieberstein's rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow berry that ripens in late summer. Sclerostemma biebersteinianum is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic landscapes."
