    "intro": "Spilotantha staaliana, commonly known as the St. Helena dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and has adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom from spring to early summer. Spilotantha staaliana is of particular interest to botanists due to its endemic status and its role in the island's fragile ecosystem."
