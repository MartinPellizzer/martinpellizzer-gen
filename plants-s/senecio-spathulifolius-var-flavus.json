    "intro": "Senecio spathulifolius var. flavus, commonly known as the yellow ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange ray florets and dark green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, dandelion-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
