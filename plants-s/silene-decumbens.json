    "intro": "Silene decumbens, commonly known as the creeping catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Silene decumbens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open fields, where it thrives in full sun."
