    "intro": "Salvia lavandulifolia var. pyrenaeorum, commonly known as Spanish lavender or narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that emit a subtle mint-like fragrance. The plant produces spikes of small, violet-blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and essential oil content make it a popular choice in both horticulture and aromatherapy."
