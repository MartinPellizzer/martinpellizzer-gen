    "intro": "Serratula gnaphaloides, commonly known as the slender goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Serratula gnaphaloides is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many flowering plants with composite flower heads."
