    "intro": "Santalodes fraternum, commonly known as the sacred sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Santalodes fraternum is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
