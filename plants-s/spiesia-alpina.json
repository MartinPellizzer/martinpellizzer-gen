    "intro": "Spiesia alpina, commonly known as the alpine spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features upright stems covered in small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Spiesia alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open meadows and slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters."
