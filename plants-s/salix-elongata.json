    "intro": "Salix elongata, commonly known as the elongated willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
