    "intro": "Stenocereus standleyi, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Mexican states of Durango and Sinaloa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by bats and insects. Its areoles are densely covered with white, bristle-like hairs, providing protection against intense sunlight and moisture loss. Stenocereus standleyi is well adapted to arid environments and plays a vital role in its ecosystem."
