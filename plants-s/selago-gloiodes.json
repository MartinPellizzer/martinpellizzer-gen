    "intro": "Selago gloiodes, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, often clustered in spikes. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Selago gloiodes is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
