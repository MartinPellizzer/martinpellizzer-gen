    "intro": "Salvia dubia, commonly known as the desert sage, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Salvia dubia is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
