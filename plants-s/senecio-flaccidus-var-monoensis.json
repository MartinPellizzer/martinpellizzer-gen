    "intro": "Senecio flaccidus var. monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Lake senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often found near the shores of Mono Lake. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
