    "intro": "Stipa densiflora, commonly known as denseflower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly packed, giving it a distinctive appearance, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Stipa densiflora is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
