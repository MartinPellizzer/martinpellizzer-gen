    "intro": "Scaphochlamys kunstleri var. kayuweh, commonly known as the Kayuweh orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure includes a distinctive lip that is often marked with intricate patterns, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
