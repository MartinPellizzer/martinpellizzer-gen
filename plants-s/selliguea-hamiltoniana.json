    "intro": "Selliguea hamiltoniana, commonly known as the Hamilton's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or decaying wood. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leafy shoot system, and its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Selliguea hamiltoniana is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves and the presence of rhizoids that anchor it to its substrate. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
