    "intro": "Senecio dieterlenii, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
