    "intro": "Syzygium coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-skin tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its leaves and fruit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The fruit, while not commonly consumed fresh, has been used in local cuisines and for its medicinal benefits."
