    "intro": "Sedum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. Sedum glabrum is a hardy perennial that requires minimal care once established."
