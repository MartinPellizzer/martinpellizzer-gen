    "intro": "Saponaria noctiflora, commonly known as night-flowering soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom at night, a unique adaptation to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which have foaming properties and are used in traditional herbal medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are often hairy as well. Saponaria noctiflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
