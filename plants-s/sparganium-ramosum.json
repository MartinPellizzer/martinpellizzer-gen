    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum, commonly known as the fragrant bur reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. The plant produces clusters of spadices, which are cylindrical flower spikes that are often mistaken for spikes of grass. Its seeds are enclosed in spiny, woody fruits that help in seed dispersal. Sparganium ramosum plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
