    "intro": "Sarcinula coronula, commonly known as the crown coral, is a unique marine invertebrate that belongs to the class Anthozoa. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure that resembles a crown, hence its common name. The organism is composed of polyps that are covered in a layer of calcareous material, giving it a stony appearance. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found in reef environments. Due to its ecological role in providing habitat for various marine species, it plays an important part in marine biodiversity."
