    "intro": "Santaloides erecta, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant wood and its ability to grow in poor soil conditions. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating. The tree is valued for its timber and has cultural significance in traditional medicine and religious practices."
