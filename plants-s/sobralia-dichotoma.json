It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic species, often found on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. Sobralia dichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
