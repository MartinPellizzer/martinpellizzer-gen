    "intro": "Synaphea stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf synaphea, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Synaphea stenoloba plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
