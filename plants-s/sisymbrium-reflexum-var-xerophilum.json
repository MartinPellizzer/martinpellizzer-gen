    "intro": "Sisymbrium reflexum var. xerophilum, commonly known as the desert mustang grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
