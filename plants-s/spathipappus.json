    "intro": "Spathipappus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and distinctive composite flower heads. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Spathipappus species are typically found in temperate regions and are often seen growing in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. These plants play an important role in supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in their ecosystems."
