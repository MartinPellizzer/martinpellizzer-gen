    "intro": "Sagittaria bracteata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the submerged mud. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sagittaria bracteata thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and pond margins. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
