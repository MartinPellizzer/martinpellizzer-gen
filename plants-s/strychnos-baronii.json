    "intro": "Strychnos baronii, commonly known as the baron's strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. However, like many species in the genus Strychnos, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
