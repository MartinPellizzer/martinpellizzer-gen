    "intro": "Symplocos pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Symplocos pilosiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
