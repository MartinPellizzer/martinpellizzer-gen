    "intro": "Sedum acre var. aureum, commonly known as golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often tinged with gold. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers in the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant color and ability to form dense, compact growth."
