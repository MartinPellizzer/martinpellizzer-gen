    "intro": "Solanum inconstans, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and berries that change color as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from closely related species."
