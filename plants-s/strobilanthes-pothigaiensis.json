    "intro": "Strobilanthes pothigaiensis, commonly known as the Pothigai flameflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is known for its short blooming period. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
