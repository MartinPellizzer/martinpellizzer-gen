    "intro": "Stemonurus puberulus, commonly known as the hairy stemonurus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are often pale green or white in color. Stemonurus puberulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
