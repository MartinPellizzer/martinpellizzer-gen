    "intro": "Santolina villosa, commonly known as woolly santolina, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Santolina villosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
