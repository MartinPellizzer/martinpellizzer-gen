    "intro": "Solenanthus kurdicus, commonly known as the Kurdish solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iraq and Turkey. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with simple, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
