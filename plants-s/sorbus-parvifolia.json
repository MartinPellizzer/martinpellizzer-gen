    "intro": "Sorbus parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, oval to elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. Sorbus parvifolia is often found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and open habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
