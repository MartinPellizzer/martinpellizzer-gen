    "intro": "Schefflera simulans, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Schefflera simulans thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and indoor gardening."
