    "intro": "Silene brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petalled catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clustered, pinkish to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Silene brachypetala is often found in tundra and subalpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
