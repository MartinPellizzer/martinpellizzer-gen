    "intro": "Sedum nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada sedum, is a perennial succulent native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
