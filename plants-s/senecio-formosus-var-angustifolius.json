    "intro": "Senecio formosus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved groundsels, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
