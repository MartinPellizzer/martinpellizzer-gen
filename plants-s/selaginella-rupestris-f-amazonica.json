    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian spikemoss, is a rare and intriguing member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is a vascular plant characterized by its small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found on the upper stems. This fern ally thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are closely arranged and exhibit a unique pattern of stomata, which aid in water retention. The plant's ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of the ecological balance in its native habitats."
