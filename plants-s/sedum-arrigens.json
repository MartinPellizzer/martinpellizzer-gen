    "intro": "Sedum arrigens, commonly known as the desert stonecress, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a touch of color to rocky landscapes. It is often found growing on cliffs, rocky outcrops, and sandy soils. Sedum arrigens is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
