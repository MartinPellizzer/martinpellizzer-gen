    "intro": "Statice cuspidata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, violet-blue flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are evergreen, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Statice cuspidata is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and silvery-blue color."
