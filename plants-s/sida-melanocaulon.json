It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its seeds are encased in a capsule.

Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
