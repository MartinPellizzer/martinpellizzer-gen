    "intro": "Spergularia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky willow or red sand flat, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its leaves are typically covered with a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. Spergularia glutinosa is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
