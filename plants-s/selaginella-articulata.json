    "intro": "Selaginella articulata, commonly known as the clubmoss or thread moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive branching pattern. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella articulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
