    "intro": "Stipa leptostachya var. capilliseta, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with silky, barbed hairs, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid environments."
