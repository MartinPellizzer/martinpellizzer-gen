    "intro": "Senecio billardierei, commonly known as the Kangaroo Island Groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it well-suited to its natural habitat. Due to its restricted range, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
