    "intro": "Scirpus drepanensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers at the top of the stems, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize wetland soils. Scirpus drepanensis plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
